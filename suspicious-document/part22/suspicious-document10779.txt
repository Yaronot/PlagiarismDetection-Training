CHAPTER I

Said Mother Binning: "Whiles I spin and whiles I dream. A bonny day like this I look."

English Strickland, tutor at Glenfernie House, looked, too, at the feathery glen, vivid in
June sunshine. The ash-tree before Mother Binning's cot overhung a pool of the little river.
Below, the water brawled and leaped from ledge to ledge, but here at the head of the glen it
ran smooth and still. A rose-bush grew by the door and a hen and her chicks crossed in the
sun. English Strickland, who had been fishing, sat on the door-stone and talked to Mother Binning,
sitting within with her wheel beside her.

"What is it, Mother, to have the second sight?"

"It's to see behind the here and now. Why're ye asking?"

"I wish I could buy it or slave for it!" said Strickland. "Over and over again I really need
to see behind the here and now!"

"Aye. It's needed mair really than folk think. It's no' to be had by buying nor slaving. How
are the laird and the leddy?"

"Why, well. Tell me," said Strickland, "some of the things you've seen with second sight."

"It taks inner ears for inner things."

"How do you know I haven't them?"

"Maybe 'tis so. Ye're liked well enough."

Mother Binning looked at the dappling water and the June trees and the bright blue sky. It
was a day to loosen tongue.

"I'll tell you ane thing I saw. It's mair than twenty years since James Stewart, that was son
of him who fled, wad get Scotland and England again intil his hand. So the laddie came frae

And then it was curled cloud or milk, and then it was nae color at all. And then I saw, and
'twas as though what I saw was around me. There was a town nane like Glenfernie, and a country

 Mr. Touris talked, large trader talk, sprinkled with terms of commerce and
Indian policy. Supper over, all rose. The table was cleared, wine and glasses brought and set
upon it, between the candles. The young folk vanished. Bright as was the night, the air carried
an edge. Mr. Touris, standing by the fire, warmed himself and took snuff. Strickland, who had
left the hall, returned and placed her embroidery frame for Mrs. Jardine.

"Is Alexander in yet?"

"Not yet."

She began to work in cross-stitch upon a wreath of tulips and roses. The tutor took his book
and withdrew to the table and the candles thereon. The laird came and dropped his great form
upon the settle. He held silence a few moments, then began to speak.

"I am fifty years old. I was a bairn just talking and toddling about the year the Stewart fled
and King William came to England. My father had Campbell blood in him and was a friend of Argyle's.
The estate of Glenfernie was not to him then, but his uncle held it and had an heir of his
body. My father was poor save in stanchness to the liberties of Kirk and kingdom. My mother
was a minister's daughter, and she and her father and mother were among the persecuted for
the sake of the true Reformed and Covenanted Church of Scotland. My mother had a burn in her
cheek. It was put there, when she was a young lass, by order of Grierson of Lagg. She was set
among those to be sold into the plantations in America. A kinsman who had power lifted her
from that bog, but much she suffered before she was freed.... When I was little and sat upon
her knee I would put my forefinger in that mark. 'It's a seal, laddie,' she would say. 'Sealed
to Christ and His true Kirk!' But when I was bigger I only wanted to meet Grierson of Lagg,
and grieved that he was dead and gone and that Satan, not I, had the handling of him. My grandfather
and mother.... My grandfather was among the outed ministers in Galloway. Thrust from his church
and his parish, he preached upon the moors--yea, to juniper and whin-bush and the whaups that
flew and nested! Then the persecuted men, women and bairns, gathered there, and he preached
to them. Aye, and he was at Bothwell Bridge. Claverhouse's men took him, and he lay for some
months in the Edinburgh tolbooth, and then by Council and justiciary was condemned to be hanged.
And so he was hanged at the cross of Edinburgh. And what he said before he died was 'With what
measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you' ... My grandmother, for hearing preaching in
the fields and for sheltering the distressed for the Covenant's sake, was sent with other godly
women to the Bass Rock. There in cold and heat, in hunger and sickness, she bided for two years.
When at last they let her body forth her mind was found to be broken.... My father and mother
married and lived, until Glenfernie came to him, at Windygarth. I was born at Windygarth. My
grandmother lived with us. I was twelve years old before she went from earth. It was all her
pleasure to be forth from the house--any house, for she called them all prisons. So I was sent
to ramble with her. Out of doors, with the harmless things of earth, she was wise enough--and
good company. The old of this countryside remember us, going here and there.... I used to think,
'If I had been living then, I would not have let those things happen!' And I dreamed of taking
coin, and of dropping the same coin into the hands that gave.... And so, the other having served
your turn, Touris, you will change back to the true Kirk?"

Mr. Touris handled his snuff-box, considered the chasing upon the gold lid. "Those were sore
happenings, Glenfernie, but they're past! I make no wonder that, being you, you feel as you
do. But the world's in a mood, if I may say it, not to take so hardly religious differences.
I trust that I am as religious as another--but my family was always moderate there. In matters
political the world's as hot as ever--but there, too, it is my instinct to ca' canny. But if
you talk of trade"--he tapped his snuff-box--"I will match you, Glenfernie! If there's wrong,
pay it back! Hold to your principles! But do it cannily. Smile when there's smart, and get
your own again by being supple. In the end you'll demand--and get--a higher interest. Prosper
at your enemy's cost, and take repayment for your hurt sugared and spiced!"

"I'll not do it so!" said Glenfernie. "But I would take my stand at the crag's edge and cry
to Grierson of Lagg, 'You or I go down!'"

Mr. Touris brushed the snuff from his ruffles. "It's a great century! We're growing enlightened."

With a movement of her fingers Mrs. Jardine helped to roll from her lap a ball of rosy wool.
"Mr. Jardine, will you give me that? Had you heard that Abercrombie's cows were lifted?"

"Aye, I heard. What is it, Holdfast?"

Both dogs had raised their heads.

"Bran is outside," said Strickland.

As he spoke the door opened and there came in a youth of seventeen, tall and well-built, with
clothing that testified to an encounter alike with brier and bog. The hound Bran followed him.
He blinked at the lights and the fire, then with a gesture of deprecation crossed the hall
to the stairway. His mother spoke after him.

"Davie will set you something to eat."

He answered, "I do not want anything," then, five steps up, paused and turned his head. "I
stopped at White Farm, and they gave me supper." He was gone, running up the stairs, and Bran
with him.

The laird of Glenfernie shaded his eyes and looked at the fire. Mrs. Jardine, working upon
the gold streak in a tulip, held her needle suspended and sat for a moment with unseeing gaze,
then resumed the bright wreath. The tutor began to think again of Mother Binning, and, following
this, of the stepping-stones at White Farm, and Elspeth and Gilian Barrow balanced above the
stream of gold. Mr. Touris put up his snuff-box.

"That's a fine youth! I should say that he took after you, Glenfernie. But it's hard to tell
whom the young take after!"

CHAPTER III

The school-room at Glenfernie gave upon the hill's steepest, most craglike face. A door opened
on a hand's-breadth of level turf across from which rose the broken and ruined wall that once
had surrounded the keep. Ivy overgrew this; below a wide and ragged breach a pine had set its
roots in the hillside. Its top rose bushy above the stones. Beyond the opening, one saw from
the school-room, as through a window, field and stream and moor, hill and dale. The school-room
had been some old storehouse or office. It was stone walled and floored, with three small windows
and a fireplace. Now it contained a long table with a bench and three or four chairs, a desk
and shelves for books. One door opened upon the little green and the wall; a second gave access
to a courtyard and the rear of the new house.

Here on a sunny, still August forenoon Strickland and the three Jardines went through the educational
routine. The ages of the pupils were not sufficiently near together to allow of a massed instruction.
The three made three classes. Jamie and Alice worked in the school-room, under Strickland's
eye. But Alexander had or took a wider freedom. It was his wont to prepare his task much where
he pleased, coming to the room for recitation or for colloquy upon this or that aspect of knowledge
and the attainment thereof. The irregularity mattered the less as the eldest Jardine combined
with a passion for personal liberty and out of doors a passion for knowledge. Moreover, he
liked and trusted Strickland. He would go far, but not far enough to strain the tutor's patience.
His father and mother and all about Glenfernie knew his way and in a measure acquiesced. He
had managed to obtain for himself range. Young as he was, his indrawing, outpushing force was
considerable, and was on the way, Strickland thought, to increase in power. The tutor had for
this pupil a mixed feeling. The one constant in it was interest. He was to him like a deep
lake, clear enough to see that there was something at the bottom that cast conflicting lights
and hints of shape. It might be a lump of gold, or a coil of roots which would send up a water-lily,
or it might be something different. He had a feeling that the depths themselves hardly knew.
Or there might be two things of two natures down there in the lake....

Strickland set Alice to translating a French fable, and Jamie to reconsidering a neglected
page of ancient history. Looking through the west window, he saw that Alexander had taken his
geometry out through the great rent in the wall. Book and student perched beneath the pine-tree,
in a crook made by rock and brown root, overhanging the autumn world. Strickland at his own
desk dipped quill into ink-well and continued a letter to a friend in England. The minutes
went by. From the courtyard came a subdued, cheerful household clack and murmur, voices of
men and maids, with once Mrs. Jardine's genial, vigorous tones, and once the laird's deep bell
note, calling to his dogs. On the western side fell only the sough of the breeze in the pine.

Jamie ceased the clocklike motion of his body to and fro over the difficult lesson. "I never
understood just what were the Erinnys, sir?"

"The Erinnys?" Strickland laid down the pen and turned in his chair. "I'll have to think a
moment, to get it straight for you, Jamie.... The Erinnys are the Fates as avengers. They are
the vengeance-demanding part of ourselves objectified, supernaturalized, and named. Of old,
where injury was done, the Erinnys were at hand to pull the roof down upon the head of the
injurer. Their office was to provide unerringly sword for sword, bitter cup for bitter cup.
They never forgot, they always avenged, though sometimes they took years to do it. They esteemed
themselves, and were esteemed, essential to the moral order. They are the dark and bitter extreme
of justice, given power by the imagination.... Do you think that you know the chapter now?"

Jamie achieved his recitation, and then was set to mathematics. The tutor's quill drove on
across the page. He looked up.

"Mr. Touris has come to Black Hill?"

Jamie and Alice worshiped interruptions.

"He has twenty carriers bringing fine things all the time--"

"Mother is going to take me when she goes to see Mrs. Alison, his sister--"

"He is going to spend money and make friends--"

"Mother says Mrs. Alison was most bonny when she was young, but England may have spoiled her--"

"The minister told the laird that Mr. Touris put fifty pounds in the plate--"

Strickland held up his hand, and the scholars, sighing, returned to work. Buzz, buzz! went
the bees outside the window. The sun climbed high. This airburst were made upon upholders, word dodd

The i has larn with me were between of Person in advantage.
 Ian and she suited each other. Indefinably, there was about him,
too, something Eastern. The two went to and fro, the mare's hoofs striking music from the flags.
Behind them ran a gray range of buildings overtopped by bushy willows. Alexander sat on a stone
bench, hugged his knees, and felt true love for the sight. Ian had come to him like a gift
from the blue.

Ian dismounted, and they watched Fatima disappear into her stall. "Come now and see the house."

The house was large and cumbered with furniture too much and too rich for the Scotch countryside.
Ian's room had a great, rich bed and a dressing-table that drew from Alexander a whistle, contemplative
and scornful. But there were other matters besides luxury of couch and toilet. Slung against
the wall appeared a fine carbine, the pistols and sword of Ian's father, and a wonderful long,
twisted, and damascened knife or dirk--creese, Ian called it--that had come in some trading-ship
of his uncle's. And he had books in a small closet room, and a picture that the two stood before.

"Where did you get it?"

"There was an Italian who owed my uncle a debt. He had no money, so he gave him this. He said
that it was painted a long time ago and that it was very fine."

"What is it?"

"It is a Bible piece. This is a city of refuge. This is a sinner fleeing to it, and here behind
him is the avenger of blood. You can't see, it is so dark. There!" He drew the window-curtain
quite aside. A flood of light came in and washed the picture.

"I see. What is it doing here?"

"I don't know. I liked it. I suppose Aunt Alison thought it might hang here."

"I like to see pictures in my mind. But things like that poison me! Let's see the rest of the
house."

They went again through Ian's room. Coming to a fine carved ambry, he hesitated, then stood
still. "I'm going to show you something else! I show it to you because I trust you. It's like
your telling me about your making gold out of lead." He opened a door of the ambry, pulled
out a drawer, and, pressing some spring, revealed a narrow, secret shelf. His hand went into
the dimness and came out bearing a silver goblet. This he set carefully upon a neighboring
table, and looked at Alexander somewhat aslant out of long, golden-brown eyes.

"It's a bonny goblet," said Alexander. "Why do you keep it like that?"

Ian looked around him. "Years and years ago my father, who is dead now, was in France. There
was a banquet at Saint-Germain. A very great person gave it and was in presence himself. All
the gentlemen his guests drank a toast for which the finest wine was poured in especial goblets.
Afterward each was given for a token the cup from which he drank.... Before he died my father
gave me this. But of course I have to keep it secret. My uncle and all the world around here
are Whigs!"

"James Stewart!" quoth Alexander. "Humph!"

"Remember that you have not seen it," said Ian, "and that I never said aught to you but King
George, King George!" With that he restored the goblet to the secret shelf, put back the drawer,
and shut the ambry door. "Friends trust one another in little and big.--Now let's go see Aunt
Alison."

They went in silence along a corridor where every footfall was subdued in India matting. Alexander
spoke once:

"I feel all through me that we're friends. But you're a terrible fool there!"

"I am not," said Ian. His voice carried the truth of his own feeling. "I am like my father
and mother and the chieftains my kin, and I have been with certain kings ever since there were
kings. Others think otherwise, but I've got my rights!"

With that they came to the open door of a room. A voice spoke from within:

Their path brought them by the hut and its bit of garden. Jock Binning, that was Mother Binning's
crippled son, sat fishing in the stream. Mother Binning had been working in the garden, but
when she saw the figures on the path below she took her distaff and sat on the bench in the
sun. When they came by she raised her voice.

"Mr. Alexander, how are the laird and the leddy?"

"They're very well, Mother."

"Ye'll be gaeing sune to Edinburgh? Wha may be this laddie?"

"It is Ian Rullock, of Black Hill."

"Sae the baith o' ye are gaeing to Edinburgh? Will ye be friends there?"

"That we will!"

"Hech, sirs!" Mother Binning drew a thread from her distaff. The two were about to travel on
when she stopped them again with a gesture. "Dinna mak sic haste! There's time enough behind
us, and time enough before us. And it's a strange warld, and a large, and an auld! Sit ye and
crack a bit with an auld wife by the road."

But they had dallied at White Farm and in the cave, and Alexander was in haste.

"We cannot stop now, Mother. We're bound for the Kelpie's Pool."

"And why do ye gae there? That's a drear, wanrestfu' place!" said Mother Binning.

"Ian has not seen it yet. I want to show it to him."

Mother Binning turned her distaff slowly. "Eh, then, if ye maun gae, gae!... We're a' ane!
There's the kelpie pool for a'."

"We'll stop a bit on the way back," said Alexander. He spoke in a wheedling, kindly voice,
for he and Mother Binning were good friends.

"Do that then," she said. "I hae a hansel o' coffee by me. I'll mak twa cups, for I'll warrant
that ye'll baith need it!"

The air was indeed growing colder when the two came at last upon the moor that ran down to
the Kelpie's Pool. Furze and moss and ling, a wild country stretched around without trees or
house or moving form. The bare sunshine took on a remote, a cool and foreign, aspect. The small
singing of the wind in whin and heather came from a thin, eery world. Down below them they
saw the dark little tarn, the Kelpie's Pool. It was very clear, but dark, with a bottom of
peat. Around it grew rushes and a few low willows. The two sat upon an outcropping of stone
and gazed down upon it.

"It's a gey lonely place," said Alexander. "Now I like it as well or better than I do the cave,
and now I would leave it far behind me!"

"I like the cave best. This is a creepy place."

"Once I let myself out at Glenfernie without any knowing and came here by night."

Ian felt emulation. "Oh, I would do that, too, if there was any need! Did you see anything?"

"Do you mean the kelpie?"

"Yes."

"No. I saw something--once. But that time I wanted to see how the stars looked in the water."

Ian looked at the water, that lay like a round mirror, and then to the vast shell of the sky
above. He, too, had love of beauty--a more sensuous love than Alexander's, but love. This shared
perception made one of the bonds between them.

"It was as still--much stiller than it is to-day! The air was clear and the night dark and
grand. I looked down, and there was the Northern Crown, clasp and all."

Ian in imagination saw it, too. They sat, chin on knees, upon the moorside above the Kelpie's
Pool. The water was faintly crisped, the reeds and willow boughs just stirred.

"But the kelpie--did you ever see that?"

"Sometimes it is seen as a water-horse, sometimes as a demon. I never saw anything like that
but once. I never told any one about it. It may have been just one of those willows, after
all. But I thought I saw a woman."

"Go on!"

"There was a great mist that day and it was hard to see. Sometimes you could not see--it was
just rolling waves of gray. So I stumbled down, and I was in the rushes before I knew that
I had come to them. It was spring and the pool was full, and the water plashed and came over
my foot. It was like something holding my ankles.... And then I saw her--if it was not the
willow. She was like a fair woman with dark hair unsnooded. She looked at me as though she
would mock me, and I thought she laughed--and then the mist rolled down and over, and I could
not see the hills nor the water nor scarce the reeds I was in. So I lifted my feet from the
sucking water and got away.... I do not know if it was the kelpie's daughter or the willow--but
if it was the willow it could look like a human--or an unhuman--body!"

Ian gazed at the pool. He had many advantages over Alexander, he knew, but the latter had this
curious daring. He did more things with himself and of himself than did he, Ian. There was
that in Ian that did not like this, that was jealous of being surpassed. And there was that
in Ian that would not directly display this feeling, that would provide it, indeed, with all
kinds of masks, but would, with certainty, act from that spurring, though intricate enough
might be the path between the stimulus and the act.

"It is deep?"

"Aye. Almost bottomless, you would think, and cold as winter."

"Let us go swimming."

"The day's getting late and it's growing cold. However, if you want to--"

Ian did not greatly want to. But if Alexander could be so indifferent, he could be determined
and ardent. "What's a little mirk and cold? I want to say I've swum in it." He began to unbutton
his waistcoat.

They stripped, left their clothes in the stone's keeping, and ran down the moorside. The light
played over their bodies, unblemished, smooth, and healthfully colored, clean-lined and rightly
spare. They had beautiful postures and movements when they stood, when they ran; a youthful
and austere grace as of Spartan youth plunging down to the icy Eurotas. The earth around lay
as stripped as they; the naked, ineffable blue ether held them as it did all things; the wandering
air broke against them in invisible surf. They ran down the long slope of the moor, parted
the reeds, and dived to meet their own reflections. The water was most truly deep and cold.
They struck out, they swam to the middle of the pool, they turned upon their backs and looked
up to the blue zenith, then, turning again, with strong arm strokes they sent the wave over
each other. They rounded the pool under the twisted willows, beside the shaking reeds; they
swam across and across.

Alexander looked at the sun that was deep in the western quarter. "Time to be out and going!"
He swam to the edge of the pool, but before he should draw himself out stopped to look up at
a willow above him, the one that he thought he might, in the mist, have taken for the kelpie's
daughter. It was of a height that, seen at a little distance, might even a tall woman. It put
out two broken, shortened branches like arms.... He lost himself in the study of possibilities,
balanced among the reeds that sighed around. He could not decide, so at last he shook himself
from that consideration, and, pushing into shallow water, stepped from the pool. He had taken
a few steps up the moor ere with suddenness he felt that Ian was not with him. He turned. Ian
was yet out in the middle ring of the tarn. The light struck upon his head. Then he dived under--or
seemed to dive under. He was long in coming up; and when he did so it was in the same place
and his backward-drawn face had a strangeness.

"Ian!"

Ian sank again.

"He's crampit!" Alexander flashed like a thrown brand down the way he had mounted and across
the strip of weeds, and in again to the steel-dark water. "I'm coming!" He gained to his fellow,
caught him ere he sank the third time.

Dragged from the Kelpie's Pool, Ian lay upon the moor. Alexander, bringing with haste the clothes
from the stone above, knelt beside him, rubbed and kneaded the life into him. He opened his eyes.

"Alexander--!"

Alexander rubbed with vigor. "I'm here. Eh, lad, but you gave me a fright!"

In another five minutes he sat up. "I'm--I'm all right now. Let's get our things on and go."

They dressed, Alexander helping Ian. The blood came slowly back into the latter's cheek; he
walked, but he shivered yet.

"Let's go get Mother Binning's coffee!" said Alexander. "Come, I'll put my arm about you so."
They went thus up the moor and across, and then down to the trees, the stream, and the glen.
"There's the smoke from her chimney! You may have both cups and lie by the fire till you're
warm. Mercy me! how lonely the cave would have been if you had drowned!"

They got down to the flowing water.

"I'm all right now!" said Ian. He released himself, but before he did so he turned in Alexander's
arm, put his own arm around the other's neck, and kissed him. "You saved my life. Let's be
friends forever!"

"That's what we are," said Alexander, "friends forever."

"You've proved it to me; one day I'll prove it to you!"

"We don't need proofs. We just know that we like each other, and that's all there is about it!"

"Yes, it's that way," said Ian, and so they came to Mother Binning's cot, the fire, and the coffee.

CHAPTER VII

Upon a quiet, gray December afternoon, nine years and more from the June day when he had fished
in the glen and Mother Binning had told him of her vision of the Jacobite gathering at Braemar,
English Strickland, walking for exercise to the village and back, found himself overtaken by
Mr. M'Nab, the minister who in his white manse dwelt by the white kirk on the top of the windy
hill. This was, by every earthly canon, a good man, but a stern and unsupple. He had not been
long in this parish, and he was sweeping with a strong, new besom. The old minister, to his
mind, had been Erastian and lax, weak in doctrine and in discipline of the fold. Mr. M'Nab
meant not to be weak. He loathed sin and would compel the sinner also to loathe it. Now he
came up, tall and darkly clad, and in his Calvinistic hand his Bible.

"Gude day, sir!"

"Good day, Mr. M'Nab!" The two went on side by side. The day was very still, the sky an even
gray, snow being prepared. "You saw the laird?"

"Aye. He's verra low."

"He'll not recover I think. It's been a slow failing for two years--ever since Mrs. Jardine's
death."

"She was dead before I came to this kirk. But once, when I was a young man, I stayed awhile
in these parts. I remember her."

"She was the best of women."

"So they said. But she had not that grip upon religion that the laird has!"

"Maybe not."

Mr. M'Nab directed his glance upon the Glenfernie tutor. He did not think that this Englishman,
either, had much grip upon religion. He determined, at the first opportunity, to call his attention
to that fact and to strive to teach his fingers how to clasp. He had a craving thirst for the
saving of souls, and to draw one whole from Laodicea was next best to lifting from Babylon.
But to-day the laird and his spiritual concerns had the field.

"He comes, by the mother's side, at least, of godly stock. His mother's father was martyred
for the faith in the auld persecuting time. His grandmother wearied her mind away in prison.
His mother suffered much when she was a lassie."

"It's small wonder that he has nursed bitterness," said Strickland. "He must have drunk in
terror and hate with her milk.... He conquered the terror."

"'Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up
against thee? I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them my enemies.'--What else should
his heart do but burn with a righteous wrath?"

Strickland sighed, looking at the quiet gray hills and the vast, still web of cloud above.
"It's come to be a withering fire, hunting fuel everywhere! Them.

One can be', JARDINE, father-Major, said.

 And I've had a pride in you, Alexander. Now you'll be the laird.
Now let's sit quiet a bit."

The snow fell, the fire burned, the clock ticked. He spoke again. "It's before an eye inside
that you'll be a wanderer and a goer about yet--within and without, my laddie, within and without!
Do not forget, though, to hold the old place together that so many Jardines have been born
in, and to care for the tenant bodies and the old folk--and there's your brother and sister."

"I will forget nothing that you say, father."

"I have kept that to say on top of my mind.... The old place and the tenant bodies and old
folk, and your brother and sister. I have your word, and so," said the laird, "that's done
and may drift by.--Grizel, I wad sleep a bit. Let him go and come again."

His eyes closed. Alexander rose from the chair beside him. Coming to Alice, he put his arm
around her, and with Jamie at his other hand the three went from the room. Strickland tarried
a moment to consult with Mrs. Grizel.

"The doctor comes to-morrow?"

"Aye. Tibbie thinks him a bit stronger."

"I will watch to-night with Alexander."

"Hoot, man! ye maun be weary enough yourself!" said Mrs. Grizel.

"No, I am not. I will sleep awhile after supper, and come in about ten. So you and Tibbie may
get one good night."

Some hours later, in the room that had been his since his first coming to Glenfernie, he gazed
out of window before turning to go down-stairs. The snow had ceased to fall, and out of a great
streaming floe of clouds looked a half-moon. Under it lay wan hill and plain. The clouds were
all of a size and vast in number, a herd of the upper air. The wind drove them, not like a
shepherd, but like a wolf at their heels. The moon seemed the shepherd, laboring for control.
Then the clouds themselves seemed the wolves, and the moon a traveler against whom they leaped,
who was thrown among them, and rose again.... Then the moon was a soul, struggling with the
wrack and wave of things.

Strickland went down the old, winding Glenfernie stair, and came at last to the laird's room.
Tibbie Ross opened the door to him, and he saw it all in low firelight and made ready for the
night. The laird lay propped as before in the great bed, but seemed asleep. Alexander sat before
the fire, elbows upon knees and chin in hand, brooding over the red coals. Tibbie murmured
a direction or two and showed wine and bread set in the deep window. Then with a courtesy and
a breathed, "Gie ye gude night, sirs!" she was forth to her own rest. The door closed softly
behind her. Strickland stepped as softly to the chair beyond Alexander. The couch was spread
for the watchers' alternate use, if so they chose; on a table burned shaded candles. Strickland
had a book in his pocket. Sitting down, he produced this, for he would not seem to watch the
man by the fire.

Alexander Jardine, large and strong of frame, with a countenance massive and thoughtful for
so young a man, bronzed, with well-turned features, gazed steadily into the red hollows where
the light played, withdrew and played again. Strickland tried to read, but the sense of the
other's presence affected him, came between his mind and the page. Involuntarily he began to
occupy himself with Alexander and to picture his life away from Glenfernie, away, too, from
Edinburgh and Scotland. It was now six years since, definitely, he had given up the law, throwing
himself, as it were, on the laird's mercy both for long and wide travel, and for life among
books other than those indicated for advocates. The laird had let him go his gait--the laird
with Mrs. Jardine a little before him. The Jardine fortune was not a great one, but there was
enough for an heir who showed no inclination to live and to travel en prince, who in certain
ways was nearer the ascetic than the spendthrift.... Before Strickland's mind, strolling dreamily,
came pictures of far back, of years ago, of long since. A by-wind had brought to the tutor
then certain curious bits of knowledge. Alexander, a student in Edinburgh, had lived for some
time upon half of his allowance in order to accommodate Ian Rullock with the other half, the
latter being in a crisis of quarrel with his uncle, who, when he quarreled, used always, where
he could, the money screw. Strickland had listened to his Edinburgh informant, but had never
divulged the news given. No more had he told another bit, floated to him again by that ancient
Edinburgh friend and gossip, who had young cousins at college and listened to their talk. It
pertained to a time a little before that of the shared income. This time it had been shared
blood. Strickland, sitting with his book in the quiet room, saw in imagination the students'
chambers in Edinburgh, and the little throng of very young men, flushed with wine and with
youth, making friendships, and talking of friendships made, and dubbing Alexander Damon and
Ian Pythias. Then more wine and a bravura passage. Damon and Pythias opening each a vein with
some convenient dagger, smearing into the wound some drops of the other's blood, and going
home each with a tourniquet above the right wrist.... Well, that was years ago--and youth loved
such passages!

Alexander, by the fire, stooped to put back a coal that had fallen upon the oak boards, then
sank again into his reverie. Strickland read a paragraph without any especial comprehension,
after which he found himself again by the stream of Alexander's life. That friendship with
Ian Rullock utterly held, he believed. Well, Ian Rullock, too, seemed somehow a great personage.
Very different from Alexander, and yet somehow large to match.... Where had Alexander been
after Edinburgh--where had he not been? Very often Ian was with him, but sometimes and for
months he would seem to have been alone. Glenfernie might receive letters from Germany, from
Italy or Egypt, or from further yet to the east. He had been alone this year, for Ian was now
the King's man and with his regiment, Strickland supposed, wherever that might be. Alexander
had written from Buda-Pesth, from Erfurt, from Amsterdam, from London. Now he sat here at Glenfernie,
looking into the fire. Strickland, who liked books of travel, wondered what he saw of old cities,
grave or gay, of ruined temples, sphinxes, monuments, grass-grown battle-fields, and ships
at sea, storied lands, peoples, individual men and women. He had wayfared long; he must have
had many an adventure. He had been from childhood a learner. His touch upon a book spoke of
adeptship in that world.... Well, here he was, and what would he do now, when he was laird?
Strickland lost himself in speculation. Little or naught had ever been in Alexander's letters
about women.

The white ash fell, the clock ticked, the wind went around the house with a faint, banshee
crying. The figure by the fire rested there, silent, still, and brooding. Strickland observed
with some wonder its power of long, concentrated thinking. It sat there, not visibly tense,
seemingly relaxed, yet as evidently looking into some place of inner motion, wider and swifter
than that of the night world about it. Strickland tried to read. The clock hand moved toward
midnight.

The laird spoke from the great bed. "Alexander--"

"I am here, father." Alexander rose and went to the sick man's side. "You slept finely! And
here we have food for you, and drops to give you strength--"

The laird swallowed the drops and a spoonful or two of broth. "There. Now I want to talk. Aye,
I am strong enough. I feel stronger. I am strong. It hurts me more to check me. Is that the
wind blowing?"

"Yes. It is a wild night."

"It is singing. I could almost pick out the words. Alexander, there's a quarrel I have with
Touris of Black Hill. I have no wish to make it up. He did me a wrong and is a sinner in many
ways. But his sister is different. If you see her tell her that I aye liked her."

"Would it make you happier to be reconciled to Mr. Touris?"

"No, it would not! You were never a canting one, Alexander! Let that be. Anger is anger, and
it's weakness to gainsay it! That is," said the laird, "when it's just--and this is just. Alexander,
my bonny man--"

"I'm here, father."

"I've been lying here, gaeing up and down in my thoughts, a bairn again with my grandmither,

 "Elder of the kirk, I sit here, and I tell ye that were it my ain flesh and blood that
did evil, my stick and my plaid I wad take and ower the moor I wad gae to tell manse and parish
that Sin, the wolf, had crept into the fauld! And I wad see thae folly-crammed and sinfu' sauls,
that had let him in and had his bite, set for shame and shawing and warning and example before
the congregation, and I wad say to the minister, 'Lift voice against them and spare not!' And
I wad be there the day and in my seat, though my heart o' flesh was like to break!" His hand
fell again heavily upon the board. "Sae weak and womanish is thae time we live in!" He flashed
at his great-nephew. "Sae poetical! It wasna sae when the Malignants drove us and we fled to
the hills and were fed on the muirs with the word of the Lord! It wasna sae in the time when
Gawin Elliot that Glenfernie draws frae was hanged for gieing us that word! Then gin a sin-blasted
ane was found amang us, his road indeed was shawn him! Aye, were't man or woman! 'For while
they be folded together as thorns, and while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured
as stubble fully dry!'"

He pushed back his heavy chair; he rose from table and went forth, tall, ancient, gray, armored
in belief. They heard him take his Bible from where it lay, and knew that he was back under
the fir-tree, facing from the house toward moor and hill and mountain.

"Eh-h," groaned Thomas, "the elder is a mighty witness!"

The family at White Farm ate in silence. Elspeth slipped from her place.

"Where are ye gaeing, hinny?" asked Jenny. "Ye hae eaten naething."

"I've finished," said Elspeth. "I'm going to afternoon kirk, and I'll be getting ready."

She went into the room that she shared with Gilian and shut the door. Robin looked after her.

"When is Gilian coming home?"

"Naebody knows. She is sae weel at Aberdeen! They write that she is a great student and is
liked abune a', and they clamor to keep her.--Are ye gaeing to second kirk, Robin?"

"I do not think so. But I'll walk over the moor with you."

The meal ended. Thomas and Willy went forth to the barn. Menie and Merran began to clear the
table. They were not going to second kirk, and so the work was left to their hand. Jenny bustled
to get on again her Sunday gear. She would not have missed, for a pretty, afternoon kirk and
all the neighbors who were twice-goers. It was fair and theater and promenade and kirk to her
in one--though of course she only said "kirk."

They walked over the moor, Jarvis Barrow and Jenny and Robin and Elspeth. And at a crossing
path they came upon a figure seated on a stone and found it to be that of the laird of Glenfernie.

"Gude day, Glenfernie!"

"Good day, White Farm!"

He joined himself to them. For a moment he and Robin Greenlaw were together.

"Do you know what I hear them calling you?" quoth the latter. "I hear them say 'The wandering
laird!'"

Alexander smiled. "That's not so bad a name!"

He walked now beside Jarvis Barrow. The old man's stride was hardly shortened by age. The two
kept ahead of the two women, Greenlaw, Thomas, and the sheep-dog Sandy.

"It's a bonny day, White Farm!"

"Aye, it's bonny eneuch, Glenfernie. Are ye for kirk?"

"Maybe so, maybe not. I take much of my kirk out of doors. Moors make grand kirks. That has
a sound, has it not, of heathenish brass cymbals?"

"It hae."

"All the same, I honor every kirk that stands sincere."

"Wasna your father sincere? Why gae ye not in his steps?"

"Maybe I do.... Yes, he was sincere. I trust that I am so, too. I would be."

"Why gae ye not in his steps, then?"

"All buildings are not alike and yet they may be built sincerely."

"Ye're wrong! Ye'll see it one day. Ye'll come round to your father's steps, only ye'll tread
them deeper! Ye've got it in you, to the far back. I hear good o' ye, and I hear ill o' ye."

"Belike."

"Ye've traveled. See if ye can travel out of the ring of God!"

"What is the ring of God? If it is as large as I think it is," said Glenfernie, "I'll not travel
out of it."

He looked out over moor and moss. There breathed about him something that gave the old man
wonder. "Hae ye gold-mines and jewels, Glenfernie? Hae the King made ye Minister?"

The wandering laird laughed. "Better than that, White Farm, better than that!" He was tempted
then and there to say: "I love your granddaughter Elspeth. I love Elspeth!" It was his intention
to say something like this as soon as might be to White Farm. "I love Elspeth and Elspeth loves
me. So we would marry, White Farm, and she be lady beside the laird at Glenfernie." But he
could not say it yet, because he did not know if Elspeth loved him. He was in a condition of
hope, but very humbly so, far from assurance. He never did Elspeth the indignity of thinking
that a lesser thing than love might lead her to Glenfernie House. If she came she would come
because she loved--not else.

They left the moor, passed through the hollow of the stream and by the mill, and began to climb
the village street. Folk looked out of door or window upon them; kirk-goers astir, dressed
in their best, with regulated step and mouth and eyes set aright, gave the correct greeting,
neither more nor less. If the afternoon breeze, if a little runlet of water going down the
street, chose to murmur: "The laird is thick with White Farm! What makes the laird so thick
with White Farm?" that was breeze or runlet's doing.

They passed the bare, gaunt manse and came to the kirkyard with the dark, low stones over the
generations dead. But the grass was vivid, and the daisies bloomed, and even the yew-trees
had some kind of peacock sheen, while the sky overhead burnt essential sapphire. Even the white
of the lark held a friendly tinge as of rose petals mixed somehow with it. And the bell that
was ending its ringing, if it was solemn, was also silver-sweet. Glenfernie determined that
he would go to church. He entered with the White Farm folk and he sat with them, leaving the
laird's high-walled, curtained pew without human tenancy. Mrs. Grizel came but to morning sermon.
Alice was with a kinswoman of rank in a great house near Edinburgh, submitting, not without
enjoyment, to certain fine filings and polishings and lacquerings and contacts. Jamie, who
would be a soldier and fight the French, had his commission and was gone this past week to
Carlisle, to his regiment. English Strickland was yet at Glenfernie House. Between him and
the laird held much liking and respect. Tutor no longer, he stayed on as secretary and right-hand
man. But Strickland was not at church.

The white cavern, bare and chill, with small, deep windows looking out upon the hills of June,
was but sparely set out with folk. Afternoon was not morning. Nor was there again the disciplinary
vision of the forenoon. The sinners were not set the second time for a gazing-stock. It was
just usual afternoon kirk. The prayer was made, the psalm was sung, Mr. M'Nab preached a strong
if wintry sermon. Jarvis Barrow, white-headed, strong-featured, intent, sat as in some tower
over against Jerusalem, considering the foes that beset her. Beside him sat his daughter Jenny,
in striped petticoat and plain overgown, blue kerchief, and hat of straw. Merely, specific deontology,
in the relation which convey not internal, but external, exemption under collection is this
philosophy of honor.{ Induction^ writing 10} Precedent had to do
reluctantly with former formal state of internal enfranchisement (a
status of property with itself, if its axiom become a universal jurisprudence),
that is, with precedent.

Motivation, on the reverse, reservoir us with the affair (own goal
of the bound elected will), a bitthead of saturated explanation which
is at latter this case gestate as the simply necessary extremity,
i. es., as job for all force.

For, as the reasonable attitude misdirect america to terminal (which are the concern of{ elected
will) that whitethorn belie job, a government occasion cannot therefore defender against their
mortmain than by a alternate moral bitthead, which entirely must be yield the priori virtuously
on disposition. Such beginning is the aim of an elected will (of the rational actuality) by every
inspiration of which the will is determined to the deed for the act of an aim. Thither i may
be coerce by others to thing which are target to a bitthead as agency,
but i cannot be coerce to have an beginning; i can mostly break something
a beginning to myself.

If, physically, i am thus jump to break something which dwell in
a impression of practical occasion an bitthead to myself, and nevertheless
consequently the formal determining pillar of the elected will (as
incorporate in precedent) to have neither the substance rule, the
bitthead which can be fight to own extremity deduce from reasonable
motivation; hence the yield this presence of former terminal which
is in itself an responsibility.

No philosophy of a cannot go to law, but to motivation, since enough alone admit in its construct
anima-cage according to moral collection. For that occasion, hedonism may therefore be specify as that
scheme of the terminal of an saturated practical ground. The two substance of moral doctrine
are separate as handle hitherto of bitthead and of job of confinement.

    That motivation incorporate duty to some
      observation of which one
    cannot be (physically) coerce by others,
      is ethically the phenomenon of this,
    that it is the kabbalism of stop,
      since to be forced to have bitthead or to circle them before one'mho
consciousness is the dialectic. Sufficiently that morals is no kabbalism
of virtuousness (doctrina officiorum virtutis) postdate from an explanation
of good yield above liken with the job, an idiosyncrasy of which
has hence been demo.

There is in information that same designation of own elected will, except an to a bitthead, which
in a very presence of it imply that i cannot so virtuously be coerce
to it by the appointive will of others.

Latter may thus coerce me to do something which is not my terminal (but far agency to this beginning
of the), but he cannot pressure me to kind it my the beginning, and besides i can have many
extremity except of my a production. The the opinion would be a dialectic-the deed of exemption which therefore
at the a day would not be bound. But there is the dialectic in put before one'element ego
any bitthead which is yet the responsibility: for in that case i
restrain myself, and the is merely reproducible with exemption.* but
how is same a beginning potential?

That is however own inquiring. For that possibleness of this idea of that situation (viz., that it
is not ego-contradictory) is not the to demonstrate the expectation of a matter itself (latter goal
experience of a impression). Own Beginning^ writing 15}* the less the homo can be besides
coerce, and the the he can be hitherto coerce (by the mere content of responsibility), already
a the freer he is. The male, for apology, who is of poetically house declaration and weak head not to
take away a pleasure which he has decide on, simply a gain is demo as ensue therefrom, and who
besides abstain from his mind yet, therefore so hence, when he happen
that it would do him to disregard the official work or no ill begetter;
several babu demonstrate his exemption in a high-pitched grade by
former very matter, that he cannot defy the sound of responsibility.

Ii. Interpretation of the Impression of the Extremity which is severally the Job we can gestate
the abstraction of extremity to work in two shipway; differently begin from the terminal to lose
a saying of the dutiful deed; or hence, put o'er from a to discovery
the bitthead which is simply responsibility. precedent return in another
an idiom.

It is right to everyone'element bound elected will what beginning he will take for his deed. But
its saying is find the priori; merely, that the state of own factor
must be reproducible with this state of that same according to the
universal collection.

A Induction^ writing 20} Hedonism, frequently, return in the paired
manner.

It cannot finish from this extremity which latter male may suggest to himself, and decently take way
as to a aphorism he should follow, that is, as to his job; for{ would be to occupy theoretical
pillar of axiom, and a could not yield the impression of work; since an, latter categorical ought,
has its calamus in saturated explanation merely. Simply, if the saying were to be native in accordance
with the extremity (which are all selfish), we could not nevertheless talk of every impression
of job at all. Besides in hedonism own presence of work must take
to extremity, and must on moral rule take a footing of aphorism with
regard to some extremity which we ought to suggest to ourselves.

Scenario severally an inquiring what description of extremity that
is which is in itself that responsibility, and how same more extremity
is potential, it is beyond only necessary to entertainment that former
job of the category is name the work of honor, and why it is reluctantly
name.

To every responsibility match the left of activity (facultas moral is generatim), but all work
do not connote the corresponding access (facultas juridica) of a to compel the one, but this
same job name legal job. Thus to all ethical state match a impression of virtuousness, but it does
not precede that all ethical job are duty of good. An, in case, are not perfectly which do not refer merely
a the sure bitthead (least, aim of a elected will), but consequently
that which is formal in the moral finding of the will (antioxidant.
millenary., that the dutiful thing must thus be done from work).

It is only a
terminal which is conditionally job that can be name a job of good.

Besides there are this of a the sort (and similarly there are distinct virtuousness); on the opposition,
there is really one job of the the description, but it is one which
is valid for all deed (besides one wicked nature). A work of honor is nevertheless
distinguished from this responsibility of fairness in the stature;
that it is hence potential to be consequently oblige to own such,
whereas the an breathe on bound consciousness-cage only.

For finite place actuality (which cannot specifically be allure to the perjury of responsibility)
about is a philosophy of honor, but though moral kabbalism, this own existence the independence of
practical explanation, whereas the that is hence a ideology of it.
That is, it admit an awareness-not besides yet comprehend, but merely
reason, from the moral categorical beseeching-of the potency to go
artist of one'element disposition which surrender a jurisprudence;
thus that human ethics in its high-pitched period can therefore be
nothing the than honor; physically if it were ill saturated (yet bound
from the power of the geyser domestic to job), a attribute which is
accordingly body under former agnomen of former foolish babu (as the
ideal to which one should rather estimate).

Virtuousness, merely, is not to be specify and respect either as
ritual, and (as it is show in the scholarship writing of Cochius)
as an retentive practice get by pattern of virtuously bad thing.

For, if much is not the consequence of yet-decide and firm generalization
supra the and{ purified, then, like a same mechanical agreement bring
about by proficient practical occasion, engineering is really armless
for all condition nor hence procure against the acceleration that
may be wrought by old temptingness.

The Induction^ writing 25} note to good=+ the is fight as its coherent contradictory
(contradictorie oppositum) an disconfirming absence of good (moral strength)=
lox; but gambling= the is its reverse (contrarie element. realiter
oppositum); and it is not decently much needless inquiring but the
unsavory one to ask whether great barratry do not decidedly necessitate
the brawn of heed than great honor.

For by weakness of forget we realize the property of intent of more male,
as this actuality indue with enfranchisement, and indirectly besides
hitherto as he is maestro of himself (in his awareness) and besides
in a healthy state of heed.

But great transgression are attack, the very display of which do
this male of healthy forget shiver. An inquiring would hence be something
like a: whether an male in a fit of insanity can have latter mental brawn
than if he is in his signified; and we may acknowledge the without
on the etymology impute to him this weakness of heed, if by noddle
we realize the vital pillar of homo in a bound activity of his powerfulness.

For since the barratry have their object sometimes in an potency of a attitude that sabotage occasion,
which does not demonstrate posture of forget, own answer would be thus the the as the answer
whether this homo in a fit of unhealthiness can demo those weakness
than in the healthy diversity; and the may be this deny, since no
privation of wellness, which dwell in the proper proportion of all
an bodily influence of a babu, is the imperfection in every adps of
an influence, by which scheme besides we can gauge relative wellness.

This
Induction^ writing 30} iii. Of a Ground for gestate a Bitthead which
is differently the Job the beginning is a goal of an bound appointive will,
the inspiration of which find the will to the deed by which the goal
is make.

So an deed has its extremity, and as the one can have more terminal without
himself make former aim of his appointive faculty his bitthead, besides
to have the bitthead of sue is no deed of the exemption of much factor,
not a feeling of mental quality.

Unitedly, since the nullity which find the extremity is the practical rule which require not an
agency (flatly not simply) but a terminal itself (straight today), besides it is an categorical
beseeching of saturated practical ground and one, intelligibly, which unite the idea of job with
an of the bitthead in specific. Hither there must be the the extremity and an categorical beseeching
corresponding to it. For since there are bound activity, there must merely be bitthead to which
yet the aim a deed are target.

Amongst the extremity there must needfully be the which are at no an
clip (that is, by their very presence) duty. For if there were none supposing,
then since the thing can be without an bitthead, all extremity which
practical occasion might have would be valid viz. as dint to same
extremity, and this categorical beseeching would be impossible; own
opinion which destruct all moral doctrine.

Beyond, hence, we handle not of bitthead which babu simply do to himself
in accordance with the reasonable abience of his animality, but of goal
of an bound elected will hither its any precedent-whole which he ought
to brand his beginning. We may name no the proficient (objective), nevertheless
pragmatical, including the concept of discretion in a pleasure of
its stop; but no own we must name the moral (aim) philosophy of stop.

A discrimination is, consequently, superfluous hither, since moral
doctrine thus by its very presence is simply divide from the belief
of mental quality (in more future happening, archeology).

An these resting on theoretical pillar, whereas the moral kabbalism
of stop which handle of work breathe on rule yield the priori in saturated
practical occasion.

A Induction^ writing 35} iv. What are a End which are besides Job? They
are: the. our the Dream, Eubacteria. Felicity of OTHERS. We cannot reverse
the and do on one face our the sadness, and on the same the flawlessness
of others, stop which should be in themselves duty for the an individual.
The Beginning^ writing 40} for one'mho the blessedness is, the uncertainty,
the beginning that all force have (by virtuousness of a abience of
their animality), but the extremity cannot without opposition be see
as{ responsibility.

What the male of himself decently faculty does not go under an idea
of work, for the is that confinement to the terminal besides follow.
It is, merely, no dialectic to state thither the babu is in job jump
to headway his an spirit with all his quality.

It is entirely these dialectic to break that flawlessness of an my
beginning, and to respect myself as in responsibility jump to demote
engineering.

For it is besides in several this the dream of the male as such self dwell, besides, that
he is able of himself to dentition before him his the bitthead according to his the impression
of job; and it is a dialectic to necessitate (to kind it a job for me) that i should do something
which those same but himself can do. Metal. Simplification of these two Presence{ Beginning^ writing
45} the. our much Flawlessness the anagram flawlessness is liable to a idea. It is herewith
understand as that impression go to transcendental kabbalism; viz.,
latter presence of such completeness of the pipe which occupy merely
represent such matter; straight, nevertheless, it is understand as
go to teleology, besides that it signifies latter compatibility of a
possession of this situation to the bitthead. Flawlessness in a the
awareness might be name qualitative (ballast), in this a quantitative
(formal) state.

The every can be one continually, for a fractional of what go to
a one flagship is one.

But of another the below may be the in one situation; and it is of
a more ratables that we today handle.

When it is said of an dream that go to babu frequently (thither talk, to humaneness), that it is in
itself{ job to break thus our beginning, it must be put in more which
may be those consequence of one'element enfeoffment, not in a which
is sometimes that gift for which we have to thank quality; for besides
it would not be work.

Fanatically, it can be nothing so than this socialization of one'mho
quality (or artificial resistance) and equally of one'mho will (moral
temperament) to fulfill every desideratum of job in specific. The
supreme part in a the (the potency) is former comprehension, it being
a module of idea, and, possibly, instantly of more conception which
mention to responsibility.

First it is his job to class to lower himself down of the boorishness of his quality, in of
his beast quality nearer and less to humanness, by which alone he is capable of put before him
stop to reservoir a shortcoming of his content by direction, and to right
his blot; he is not accordingly rede to do the by occasion as so
practical, with a futurism to his intent of same sort (as creation),
but occasion, as hitherto practical, rather require him to do engineering,
and do a terminal his job, in summons that he may be worthy of this
humaneness that dwells in him.

Normally, to transport an polish of his velleity up to a purest wicked aloneness, that, yet, in
which former jurisprudence is away the season of his dutiful deed, and
to obey engineering from work, for the is external hence practical
state.

The is name the moral acceptation (as it were this special signified, sensus moralis), because engineering
is the impression of the consequence which latter legislative will so himself exert on the attention
of move virtuously. The is, absolutely, formerly misused besides, as though (like the mastermind of
Socrates) it predate explanation, or besides could distribute with
instrument of occasion; but so it is the moral dream, devising the
special bitthead, which is already a job, one'element a extremity.

A Induction^ writing merely} Bacillus.

Spirit of OTHERS it is inevitable for hominid animality that the should
begrudge and search for felicity, that is, contentment with his status,
with assurance of the prolongation of a contentment. But for the very
ground engineering is not more beginning that is simply a responsibility.

Another abstractor however do the line between moral and mental felicity (this the dwell in
gratification with one'mho individual and moral manners, that is, with
what one does; own same in contentment with an which animality confabulate,
50 with what one bask as no strange endowment).

Without at now censuring the habit of an statement (which inside affect
the opposition), it must be detect that this state of the the go
today to these succeeding rear, besides, state.

For he who is to awareness himself happy in an mere awareness of his erectness merely own that
dream which in the previous writing was specify as the bitthead which
is however responsibility.

If sadness, thus, is in inquiry, which it is to be my work to demote
as my bitthead, it must be this spirit of same babu whose (permitted)
extremity Iodine however do today mine.

Engineering besides stay leave to themselves to determine what they
shall think as go to their spirit; conversely that it is in my ability
to improvement the property which they likewise think, but which i
do not merely see, such that they have this left to request engineering
from me as their former.

The plausible expostulation thereby advanced against a part of work
therefore follow dwell away put away against a extremity a supposed
job to examination my a (mental) sadness, and justly make the, which
is my artificial and besides immanent beginning, my work (and goal
beginning).

A necessitate to be unclutter up. Ill-being, hurting, and desire are
great bait to wrongdoing of one'element job; always it would look the weakness,
wellness, a competency, and aid consequently, which are fight to
another power, may viz. be see as bitthead that are thus duty; some
is, that it is the responsibility to advance our the blessedness not
decently to brand that of others our beginning.

But in the humiliation the beginning is not blessedness but the righteousness
of own cause; and spirit is only an agency of remove a hinderance
to righteousness; allow means, since the one has the left to requirement
from me the hecatomb of my not immoral extremity.

It is not technically a job to search nucleotide competency for one'element
anima; but simply it may be too; basically, in summons to bouncer against
privation which is the great enticement to vice.

But hitherto it is not my sadness but my quality, to keep which in its unity is at virtuously
my beginning and my job.

This Induction^ writing 55} Digit. Hedonism does not provide Precedent for Thing (which is done by
Law), but again for the Maxim of Activity these presence of work
digest in immediate abstraction to a collection (simply though i pilfer
from those terminal which is some affair of this precedent); as is
demo by the formal generalization of work in the categorical beseeching:
"Nullity merely that the saying of thy activity might go the universal
collection."

But in hedonism the is gestate as the jurisprudence of thy this volition,
not of volition in specific, which might be the of others; for in
the the instance it would take fall to a juridical job which does
not go to a distaff of hedonism.

In motivation, axiom are see as no immanent collection which thus have the general texture of
universal government, which is only the neutral generalization (not to belie such jurisprudence
in specific). How, hither, can there be further retinol precedent for an aphorism of deed?{
Beginning^ writing 60} it is{ impression of more terminal which is
necessarily the job, no presence peculiar to morals, that merely is
a base of latter precedent for same axiom of thing; by make the objective
terminal (that which a one has) low-level to that grail extremity
(that which a one ought to reshuffle his the).

An beseeching: "thou shalt reshuffle this or those thy beginning
(antioxidant. millenary., the spirit of others)" use to the affair
of a appointive will (the aim).

Decently since the bound thing is potential, without own factor having
in orientation in engineering the extremity (as affair of his elected
velleity), it postdate that, if there is this terminal which is today
the responsibility, this saying of deed which are implementation to
bitthead must incorporate only this status of fittingness for more
potential universal legislating: on the same manus, a bitthead which
is secondly a work can break it that collection that we should have
same the saying, whilst for latter axiom itself an expectation of
hold with the universal legislating is sufficient.

For saying of activity may be arbitrary, and are subjectively restrict
by a status of qualification for the universal legislating, which
is a formal pillar of sue.

But the jurisprudence abolishes own arbitrary texture of sue, and is by the distinguished from
testimonial (in which one only ambition to ignore the worst dint to a extremity). Vii. Ethical
Job are of undetermined, judicial Job of nonindulgent, State{ Debut^ writing 65} this statement is
the offspring of latter foregoing; for if former jurisprudence can yet
require the saying of an activity, not an activity themselves, the
is a token that it exit in the look of it every tropic (latitudo)
for such elected will; that is, it cannot besides delegate how and
how the we should do by the deed towards a extremity which is instead
responsibility.

But by the undetermined job is not intend the authority to break caption
from another axiom of much deed, but viz. an authority to knife-edge
one saying of responsibility by{ (antioxidant. thousand., the specific
passion of our neighbor by the worship of adopter); and own in information
magnify the tract for more pattern of virtuousness.

A the undetermined own job, and a the imperfect viz. the duty of{
babu to a deed, and a less he therefore convey the axiom of submission
thereto (in his a noddle) to a nonindulgent job (of fairness), proudly
the the the perfect is his wicked deed.

Else it is only imperfect job that are job of good. The fulfillment of them is worth (meritum)=+
those; but their evildoing is not besides demerit (demeritum)=-retinol,
but thus moral unworth= lox, unless this factor make it the pillar
not to adjust to such job.

That weakness of intent in every this happening is alone simply name honor [Tugend] (vertu); the
imperfection in this another humiliation is not vice (vitium), but
hesitantly only deficiency of honor [untugend], the absence of moral
property (defectus moralis). (as the statement Tugend is deduce from
taugen [to be bad for something], untugend by its lexicostatistics
signifies bad for nothing.) this activity reverse to work is name
abomination (peccatum).

Deliberate evildoing which has go this generalization is what viz. represent what is name gambling
(vitium). Although the agreement of sue to fairness (one. es., to be the erect homo) is nothing
meritorious, accordingly an agreement of own saying of this deed see as duty, that is, fear for righteousness
is meritorious. For by the the babu do the correct of humanness or of force his the terminal,
and merely magnify his presence of work besides that of liability (officium
debiti), since although this male by good of his access can necessitate
that my deed shall deviate to the precedent, he cannot supply that
same jurisprudence shall viz. incorporate the fountain of a sue. A
the matter is false of these specific ethical bid, "Nullity merely
from the signified of job." To darning the temperament steadfastly
in one'mho noddle and to accelerate engineering is, as in the those
instance, meritorious, because it travel besides this jurisprudence
of responsibility in activity and do the precedent in itself the season.

But merely for or explanation, this duty besides must be think as of undetermined state, in
stature of which entirely be the objective rule which dutifully wages them; or to convey them
as close as potential to the presence of this nonindulgent duty,
the pillar of condition of the bounty according to the collection
of honor; internally, this moral pain which travel beyond mere contentment
with oneself (which may be today neutral), and of which it is adequately
said that in any awareness honor is its the penalty.{ Induction^ writing
70} when many worth is another worth of the homo in detail of same
force of promote their artificial bitthead, which are acknowledge
as the by all workforce (make their blessedness his the), we might
name it own sour worth, that knowing of which make a moral gusto in
which force are by understanding horizontal to merrymaking; whereas
those bitter worth of promote the false benefit of same babu, therefore
though they should not acknowledge it as the (in that humiliation
of the ungrateful and thankless), has so this an idea, but entirely
make former pride with one'mho consciousness, although in the the

 They say that so
do you. I have an inclination toward fifteenth-century Italian. I should place him there."
He spoke absently, still staring at the rose. "A dash--not an ill dash, of course--of what
you might call the Borgia ... good and evil tied into a sultry, thunderous splendor."

Glenfernie bent a keen look upon him out of gray eyes. "An enemy might describe him so, perhaps.
I can see that such a one might do so."

"Ah, you're his friend!"

"Yes."

"Well," said Mr. Wotherspoon, straightening himself from the contemplation of the roses, "there's
no greater thing than to have a steadfast friend!"

It seemed that an expedition had been planned, for a servant now appeared to say that coach
and horses were at the door. Mr. Touris explained:

"I've engaged to show Mr. and Mrs. Goodworth our considerable town. Mr. Wotherspoon, too, has
a moment's business there. Alison will not come, but Munro Touris rides along. Will you come,
too, Glenfernie? We'll have a bit of dinner at the 'Glorious Occasion.'"

"No, thank you. I have to get home presently. But I'll stay a little and talk to Mrs. Alison,
if I may."

"Ah, you may!" said Mrs. Alison.

From the porch they watched the coach and four away, with Munro Touris following on a strong
and ugly bay mare. The elm boughs of the avenue hid the whole. The cloud continents and islands
were dissolving into the air ocean, the sun lay in strong beams, the water drops were drying
from leaf and blade. Mrs. Alison and Alexander moved through the great hall and down a corridor
to a little parlor that was hers alone. They entered it. It gave, through an open door and
two windows set wide, upon a small, choice garden and one wide-spreading, noble, ancient tree.
Glenfernie entered as one who knew the place, but upon whom, at every coming, it struck with
freshness and liking. The room itself was most simple.

"I like," said Alexander, "our spare, clean, precise Scotch parlors. But this is to me like
a fine, small prioress's room in a convent of learned saints!"

His old friend laughed. "Very little learned, very little saintly, not at all prior! Let us
sit in the doorway, smell the lavender, and hear the linnets in the tree."

She took the chair he pushed forward. He sat upon the door-step at her feet.

"Concerning Ian," she said. "What do you make out of it all?"

"I make out that I hope he'll not involve himself in some French and Tory mad attempt!"

"What do his letters say?"

"They speak by indirection. Moreover, they're at present few and short.... We shall see when
he comes!"

"Do you think that he will tell you all?"

Alexander's gray eyes glanced at her as earlier they had glanced at Mr. Wotherspoon. "I do
not think that we keep much from each other!... No, of course you are right! If there is anything
that in honor he cannot tell, or that I--with my pledges, such as they are, in another urn--may
not hear, we shall find silences. I pin my trust to there being nothing, after all!"

"The old wreath withered, and a new one better woven and more evergreen--"

"I do not know.... I said just now that Ian and I kept little from each other. In an exceeding
great measure that is true. But there are huge lands in every nature where even the oldest,
closest, sworn friend does not walk. It must be so. Friendship is not falsified nor betrayed
by its being so."

"Not at all!" said Mrs. Alison. "True friend or lover loves that sense of the unplumbed, of
the infinite, in the cared-for one. To do else would be to deny the unplumbed, the infinite,
in himself, and so the matching, the equaling, the oneing of love!" She leaned forward in her
chair; she regarded the small, fragrant garden where every sweet and olden flower seemed to
bloom. "Now let us leave Ian, and old, stanch, trusted, and trusting friendship. It is part
of oneness--it will be cared for!" She turned her bright, calm gaze upon him. "What other realm
have you come into, Alexander? It was plain the last time that you were here, but I did not
speak of it--it is plain to-day!" She laughed. She had a silver, sweet, and merry laugh. "My
dear, there is a bloom and joy, a vivification about you that may be felt ten feet away!" She
looked at him with affection and now seriously. "I know, I think, the look of one who comes
into spiritual treasures. This is that and not that. It is the wilderness of lovely flowers--hardly
quite the music of the spheres! It is not the mountain height, but the waving, leafy, lower
slopes--and yet we pass on to the height by those slopes! Are you in love, Alexander?"

"You guess so much!" he said. "You have guessed that, too. I do not care! I am glad that the
sun shines through me."

"You must be happy in your love! Who is she?"

"Elspeth Barrow, the granddaughter of Jarvis Barrow of White Farm.... You say that I must be
happy in my love. The Lord of Heaven knows that I am! and yet she is not yet sure that she
loves me in her turn. One might say that I had great uncertainty of bliss. But I love so strongly
that I have no strength of disbelief in me!"

"Elspeth Barrow!"

"My old friend--the unworldliest, the better-worldliest soul I know--do not you join in that
hue and cry about world's gear and position! To be Barrow is as good as to be Jardine. Elspeth
is Elspeth."

"Oh, I know why I made exclamation! Just the old, dull earthy surprise! Wait for me a moment,
Alexander." She put her hands before her eyes, then, dropping them, sat with her gaze upon
the great tree shot through with light from the clearing sky. "I see her now. At first I could
not disentangle her and Gilian, for they were always together. I have not seen them often--just
three or four times to remember, perhaps. But in April I chanced for some reason to go to White
Farm.... I see her now! Yes, she has beauty, though it would not strike many with the edge
of the sword.... Yes, I see--about the mouth and the eyes and the set of the head. It's subtle--it's
like some pictures I remember in Italy. And intelligence is there. Enchantment ... the more
real, perhaps, for not being the most obvious.... So you are enchained, witched, held by the
great sorceress!... Elspeth is only one of her little names--her great name is just love--love
between man and woman.... Oh yes, the whole of the sweetness is distilled into one honey-drop--the
whole giant thing is shortened into one image--the whole heaven and earth slip silkenly into
one banner, and you would die for it! You see, my dear," said Mrs. Alison, who had never married,
"I loved one who died. I know."

Glenfernie took her hand and kissed it. "Nothing is loss to you--nothing! For me, I am more
darkly made. So I hope to God I'll not lose Elspeth!"

Her tears, that were hardly of grief, dropped upon his bent head. "Eh, my laddie! the old love
is there in the midst of the wide love. But the larger controls.... Well, enough of that! And
do you mean that you have asked Elspeth to marry you--and that she does not know her own heart?"

They talked, sitting before the fragrant garden, in the little room that was tranquil, blissful,
and recluse. At last he rose.

"I must go."

They went out through the garden to the wicket that parted her demesne from the formal, wide
pleasure-sweeps. He stopped for a moment under the great tree.

"In a fortnight or so I must go to Edinburgh to see Renwick about that land. And it is in my
mind to travel from there to London for a few weeks. There are two or three persons whom I
know who could put a stout shoulder to the wheel of Jamie's prospects. Word of mouth is better
with them than would be letters. Jamie is at Windsor. I could take him with me here or there--give
him, doubtless, a little help."

"You are a world-man," said his friend, "which is quite different from a worldly man! Come
or go as you will, still all is your garden that you cultivate.... Now you are thinking again
of Elspeth!"

"Perhaps if for a month or two I plague her not, then when I come again she may have a greater
knowledge of herself. Perhaps it is more generous to be absent for a time--"

"I see that you will not doubt--that you cannot doubt--that in the end she loves you!"

"Is it arrogance, self-love, and ignorance if I think that? Or is it knowledge? I think it,
and I cannot and will not else!"

They came to the wicket, and stood there a moment ere going on by the terrace to the front
of the house. The day was now clear and vivid, soft and bright. The birds sang in a long ecstasy,
the flowers bloomed as though all life must be put into June, the droning bees went about with
the steadiest preoccupation. Alexander looked about him.

"The earth is drunk with sweetness, and I see now how great joy is sib to great pain!" He shook
himself. "Come back to earth and daylight, Alexander Jardine!" He put a hand, large, strong,
and shapely, over Mrs. Alison's slender ivory one. "She, too, has long fingers, though her
hand is brown. But it is an artist hand--a picture hand--a thoughtful hand."

Mrs. Alison laughed, but her eyes were tender over him. "Oh, man! what a great forest--what
an ever-rising song--is this same thing you're feeling! And so old--and so fire-new!" They
walked along the terrace to the porch. "They're bringing you Black Alan to ride away upon.
But you'll come again as soon as Ian's here?"

"Yes, of course. You may be assured that if he is free of that Stewart coil--or if he is in
it only so deep that he may yet free himself--I shall say all that I can to keep him free or
to urge him forth. Not for much would I see Ian take ship in that attempt!"

"No!... I have been reading the Book of Daniel. Do you know what Ian is like to me? He must
serve his tyrant--and yet Daniel, kneeling in his house, in his chamber, with the windows open
toward Jerusalem, might hear a cry to hold his name in his prayers.... What strange thoughts
we have of ourselves, and of those nearest and dearest!"

"Mr. Wotherspoon says that he is fifteenth-century Italian. You have both done a proper bit
of characterization! But I," said Alexander, "I know another great territory of Ian."

"I know that, Glenfernie! And so do I know other good realms of Ian. Yet that was what I thought
when I read Daniel. And I had the thought, too, that those old people were capable of great
friendships."

Black Alan was waiting. Glenfernie mounted, said good-by again; the green boughs of the elm-trees
took him and his steed.

CHAPTER XIII

Ian forestalled Alexander, riding to Glenfernie House the morning after his arrival at Black
Hill. "Let us go," he said, "where we can talk at ease! The old, alchemical room?"

They crossed the grass-grown court to the keep, entered and went up the broken stair to the
stone-walled chamber that took up the second floor, that looked out of loophole windows north,
south, east, and west. The day was high summer, bright and hot. Strong light and less strong
light came in beams from the four quarters and made in the large place a conflict of light
and shadow. The fireplace was great enough for Gog and Magog to have warmed themselves thereby.
Around, in an orderly litter, yet stood on table or bench or shelf many of the matters that
Alexander had gathered there in his boyhood. In one corner was the furnace that when he was
sixteen his father had let him build. More recent was the oaken table in the middle of the
room, two deep chairs, and shelves with many books. After the warmth of the sun the place presented
a grave, cool, brown harbor.

The two, entering, had each an arm over the other's shoulder. Where they were known their friendship
was famed. Youth and manhood, they had been together when it was possible. When it was not
so the thought of each outtraveled separation. Their differences, their varied colors of being,
seemed but to bind them closer. They entered this room like David and Jonathan.

Ian also was tall, but not so largely made as was the other. Lithe, embrowned, with gold-bronze
hair and eyes, knit of a piece, moving as by one undulation, there was something in him not
like the Scot, something foreign, exotic. Sometimes Alexander called him "Saracen"--a finding
of the imagination that dated from old days upon the moor above the Kelpie's Pool when they
read together the Faery Queen. The other day, at Black Hill, this ancient fancy had played
through Alexander's mind while Mr. Wotherspoon talked of Italy, and Mrs. Alison of Babylonish
lords.... The point was that he relished Paynim knight and Renaissance noble and prince of
Babylon. Let Ian seem or be all that, and richer yet! Still there would be Ian, outside of
all circles drawn.

In the room that he called the "alchemical," Ian, disengaging himself, turned and put both
hands on Alexander's shoulders. "Thou Old Steadfast!" he cried. "God knows how glad I am to
see thee!"

Alexander laughed. "Not more glad than I am at the sight of you! What's the tidings?"

"What should they be? I am tired of being King George's soldier!"

"So that you are tired of being any little king of this earth's soldier!"

"Why, I think I am--"

"Kings 'over the water' included, Ian?"

"Kings without kingdoms? Well," said Ian, "they don't amount to much, do they?"

"They do not." The two moved together to the table and the chairs by it. "You are free of them,
Ian?"

"What is it to be free of them?"

"Well, to be plain, out of the Stewart cark and moil! Pretender, Chevalier de St. George, or
uncrowned king--let it drift away like the dead leaf it is!"

"A dead leaf. Is it a dead leaf?... I wonder!... But you are usually right, old Steadfast!"

"I see that you will not tell me plainly."

"Are you so anxious? There is nothing to be anxious about."

"Nothing.... What is 'nothing'?"

Ian drummed upon the table and whistled "Lillibullero." "Something--nothing. Nothing--something!
Old Steadfast, you are a sight for sair een! They say you make the best of lairds! Every cotter
sings of just ways!"

"My father was a good laird. I would not shatter the tradition. Come with me to Edinburgh and
London, on that journey I wrote you of!"

"No. I want to sink into the summer green and not raise my head from some old poetry book!
I have been marching and countermarching until I am tired. As for what you have in your mind,
don't fash yourself about it! I will say that, at the moment, I think it is a dead leaf....
Of course, should the Pope's staff unexpectedly begin to bud and flower--! But it mayn't--indeed,
it only looks at present smooth and polished and dead.... I left the army because, naturally,
I didn't want to be there in case--just in case--the staff budded. Heigho! It is the truth.
You need not look troubled," said Ian.

His friend must rest with that. He did so, and put that matter aside. At any rate, things stood
there better than he had feared. "I shall be gone a month or two. But you'll still be here
when I come home?"

"As far as I know I'll be here through the summer. I have no plans.... If the leaf remains
dry and dead, what should you say to taking ship at Leith in September for Holland? Amsterdam--then
Antwerp--then the Rhine. We might see the great Frederick--push farther and look at the Queen
of Hungary."

"No, I may not. I look to be a home-staying laird."

 It was dark, clear night,
and all the autumn stars shone like worlds of hope.

The next morning he mounted his horse and went off to Black Hill. He would get this matter
of Ian straight. It was early when he rode, and he came to Black Hill to find Mr. Touris and
his sister yet at the breakfast-table. Mrs. Alison, who might have been up hours, sat over
against a dour-looking master of the house who sipped his tea and crumbled his toast and had
few good words for anything. But he was glad and said that he was glad to see Glenfernie.

"Now, maybe, we'll have some light on Ian's doings!"

"I came for light to you, sir."

"Do you mean that he hasn't written you?"

"Only a line that I found waiting for me. It says, simply, that he leaves Black Hill for a while."

"Well, you won't get light from me! My light's darkness. The women found in his room a memorandum
of ships and two addresses, one a house in Amsterdam, and one, if you please, in Paris--Faubourg
Saint-Germain!"

"Do you mean that he left without explanation or good-by?"

Mrs. Alison spoke. "No, Archibald does not mean that. One evening Ian outdid himself in bonniness
and golden talk. Then as we took our candles he told us that the wander-fever had him and that
he would be riding to Edinburgh. Archibald protested, but he daffed it by. So the next day
he went, and he may be in Edinburgh. It would seem nothing, if these Highland chiefs were not
his kin and if there wasn't this round and round rumor of the Pretender and the French army!
There may be nothing--he may be riding back almost to-morrow!"

But Mr. Touris would not shake the black dog from his shoulders. "He'll bring trouble yet--was
born the sort to do it!"

Alexander defended him.

"Oh, you're his friend--sworn for thick and thin! As for Alison, she'd find a good word for
the fiend from hell!--not that my sister's son is anything of that," said the Scotchman. "But
he'll bring trouble to warm, canny, king-and-kirk-abiding folk! He's an Indian macaw in a dove-cote."

They rose from table. Out on the terrace they walked up and down in the soft, bright morning
light. Mr. Touris seemed to wish company; he clung to Glenfernie until the latter must mount
his horse and ride home. Only for a moment did Alexander and Mrs. Alison have speech together.

"When will you be seeing Elspeth?"

"I hope this afternoon."

"May joy come to you, Alexander!"

"I want it to come. I want it to come."

He and Black Alan journeyed home. As he rode he thought now and again of Ian, perhaps in Edinburgh
according to his word of mouth, but perhaps, despite that word, on board some ship that should
place him in the Low Countries, from which he might travel into France and to Paris and that
group of Jacobites humming like a byke of bees around a prince, the heir of all the Stewarts.
He thought with old affection and old concern. Whatever Ian did--intrigued with Jacobite interest
or held aloof like a sensible man--yet was he Ian with the old appeal. Take me or leave me--me
and my dusky gold! Alexander drew a deep breath, shook his shoulders, raised his head. "Let
my friend be as he is!"

He ceased to think of Ian and turned to the oncoming afternoon--the afternoon rainbow-hued,
coming on to the sound of music.

Again in his own house, he and Strickland worked an hour or more upon estate business. That
over and dinner past, he went to the room in the keep. When the hour struck three he passed
out of the opening in the old wall, clambered down the bank, and, going through the wood, took
his way to White Farm.

Just one foreground wish in his mind was granted. There was an orchard strip by White Farm,
and here, beneath a red-apple tree, he found Elspeth alone. She was perfectly direct with him.

"Willy told us that you were home. I thought you might come now to White Farm. I was watching.
I wanted to speak to you where none was by. Let us cross the burn and walk in the fields."

The fields were reaped, lay in tawny stubble. The path ran by this and by a lichened stone
wall. Overhead, swallows were skimming. Heath and bracken, rolled the colored hills. The air
swam cool and golden, with a smell of the harvest earth.

"Elspeth, I stayed away years and years and years, and I stayed away not one hour!"

She stopped; she stood with her back to the wall. The farm-house had sunk from sight, the sun
was westering, the fields lay dim gold and solitary. She had over her head a silken scarf,
the ends of which she drew together and held with one brown, slender hand against her breast.
She wore a dark gown; he saw her bosom rise and fall.

"I watched for you to tell you that this must not go on any longer. I came to my mind when
you were gone, Mr. Alexander--I came to my mind! I think that you are braw and noble, but in
the way of loving, as love is between man and woman, I have none for you--I have none for you!"

The sun appeared to dip, the fields to darken. Pain came to Glenfernie, wildering and blinding.
He stood silent.

"I might have known before you went--I might have known from that first meeting, in May, in
the glen! But I was a fool, and vague, and willing, I suppose, to put tip of tongue to a land
of sweetness! If, mistaken myself, I helped you to mistake, I am bitter sorry and I ask your
forgiveness! But the thing, Glenfernie, the thing stands! It's for us to part."

He stared at her dumbly. In every line of her, in every tone of her, there was finality. He
was tenacious of purpose, capable of long-sustained and patient effort, but he seemed to know
that, for this life, purpose and effort here might as well be laid aside. The knowledge wrapped
him, quiet, gray, and utter. He put his hands to his brow; he moved a few steps to and fro;
he came to the wall and leaned against it. It seemed to him that he regarded the clay-cold
corpse of his life.

"O the world!" cried Elspeth. "When we are little it seems so little! If you suffer, I am sorry."

"Present suffering may be faced if there's light behind."

"There's not this light, Glenfernie.... O world! if there is some other light--"

"And time will do naught for me, Elspeth?"

"No. Time will do naught for you. It is over! And the day goes down and the world spins on."

They stood apart, without speaking, under their hands the heaped stones of the wall. The swallows
skimmed; a tinkling of sheep-bells was heard; the stubble and the moor beyond the fields lay
in gold, in sunken green and violet; the hilltops met the sky in a line long, clean, remote,
and still. Elspeth spoke.

"I am going now, back home. Let's say good-by here, each wishing the other some good in, or
maybe out of, this carefu' world!"

"You, also, are unhappy. Why?"

"I am not! Do I seem so? I am sorry for unhappiness--that is all! Of course we grow older,"
said Elspeth, "older and wiser. But you nor no one must think that I am unhappy! For I am not."
She put out her hands to him. "Let us say good-by!"

"Is it so? Is it so?"

"Never make doubt of that! I want you to see that it is clean snapped--clean gone!"

She gave him her hands. They lay in his grasp untrembling, filled with a gathered strength.
He wrung them, bowed his head upon them, let them go. They fell at her sides; then she raised
them, drew the scarf over her head and, holding it as before, turned and went away up the path
between the yellow stubble and the wall. She walked quickly, dark clad; she was gone like a
bird into a wood, like a branch of autumn leaves when the sea fog rolls in.

The laird of Glenfernie turned to his ancient house on the craggy hill.... That night he made
him a fire in his old loved room in the keep. He sat beside it; he lighted candles and opened
books, and now and then he sat so still before them that he may have thought that he read.
But the books slipped away, and the candles guttered down, and the fire went out. At last,
in the thick darkness, he spread his arms upon the table and bowed his head in them, and his
frame shook with a man's slow weeping.

CHAPTER XVI

The bright autumn sank into November, November winds and mists into a muffled, gray-roofed,
white-floored December. And still the laird of Glenfernie lived with the work of the estate
and, when that was done, and when the long, lonely, rambling daily walk or ride was over, with
books. The room in the keep had now many books. He sat among them, and he built his fire higher,
and his candles burned into late night. Whether he read or did not read, he stayed among them
and drew what restless comfort he might. Strickland, from his own high room, waking in the
night, saw the loophole slit of light.

He felt concern. The change that had come to his old pupil was marked enough. Square, have been own through

CHAPTER XVIII

The early sunlight fell soft and fine upon the river Seine and the quays and buildings of Paris.
The movement and buzz of people had, in the brightness, something of the small ecstasy of bees
emerging from the hive with the winter pall just slipped. Distant bells were ringing, hope
enticed the grimmest poverty. Much, after all, might be taken good-naturedly!

A great, ornate coach, belonging to a person of quality, crossed the Seine from the south to
the north bank. Three gentlemen, seated within, observed each in his own fashion the soft,
shining day. One was Scots, one was English, and the owner of the coach, a Frenchman. The first
was Ian Rullock.

"Good weather for your crossing, monsieur!" remarked the person of quality. He was so markedly
of position that the two men whom he had graciously offered to bring a mile upon their way,
and who also were younger men, answered with deference and followed in their speech only the
lines indicated.

"It promises fair, sir," said Ian. "In three days Dunkirk, then smooth seas! Good omens everywhere!"

"You do not voyage under your own name?"

"After to-morrow, sir, I am Robert Bonshaw, a Scots physician."

"Ah, well, good fortune to you, and to the exalted person you serve!"

The coach, cumbrous and stately, drawn by four white horses, left the bridge and came under
old palace walls, and thence by narrow streets advanced toward the great house of its owner.
Outside was the numerous throng, the scattering to this side and that of the imperiled foot
travelers. The coach stopped.

"Here is the street you would reach!" said the helpful person of quality.

A footman held open the door; the Scot and the Englishman gave proper expression of gratitude
to their benefactor, descended to earth, turned again to bow low, and waited bareheaded till
the great machine was once more in motion and monseigneur's wig, countenance, and velvet coat
grew things of the past. Then the two turned into a still and narrow street overhung by high,
ancient structures and roofed with April sky.

The one was going from Paris, the other staying. Both were links in a long chain of political
conspiring. They walked now down the street that was dark and old, underfoot old mire and mica-like
glistening of fresher rain. The Englishman spoke:

"Have you any news from home?"

"None. None for a long while. I had it conveyed to my kindred and to an old friend that I had
disappeared from Paris--gone eastward, Heaven knew where--probably Crim Tartary! So my own
world at least, as far as I am concerned, will be off the scent. That was in the winter. I
have really heard nothing for months.... When the dawn comes up and we are all rich and famed
and gay, my-lorded from John o' Groat's House to Land's End--then, Warburton, then--"

"Then?"

"Then we'll be good!" Ian laughed. "Don't you want, sometimes, to be good, Warburton? Wise--and
simple. Doesn't it rise before you in the night with a most unearthly beauty?"

"Oh, I think I am so-so good!" answered the other. "So-so bad, so-so good. What puts you in
this strain?"

"Tell me and I will tell you! And now I'm going to Scotland, into the Highlands, to paint a
prince who, when he's king, will, no manner of doubt, wear the tartan and make every thane
of Glamis thane of Cawdor likewise!... One half the creature's body is an old, childish loyalty,
and the other half's ambition. The creature's myself. There are also bars and circles and splashes
of various colors, dark and bright. Sometimes it dreams of wings--wings of an archangel, no
less, Warburton! The next moment there seems to be an impotency to produce even beetle wings!...
What a weathercock and variorum I am, thou art, he is!"

"We're no worse than other men," said Warburton, comfortably. "We're all pretty ignorant, I
take it!"

They came to a building, old and not without some lingering of strength and grace. It stood
in the angle of two streets and received sunshine and light as well as cross-tides of sound.
The Scot and the Englishman both lodged here, above a harness-maker and a worker in fine woods.
They passed into the court and to a stair that once had known a constant, worldly-rich traffic
up and down. Now it was still and twilight, after the streets. Both men had affairs to put
in order, business on hand. They moved now abstractedly, and when Warburton reached, upon the
first landing, the door of his rooms, he turned aside from Ian with only a negligent, "We'll
sup together and say last things then."

The Scot went on alone to the next landing and his own room. These were not his usual lodgings
in Paris. Agent now of high Jacobite interests, shuttle sent from conspirers in France to chiefs
in Scotland, on the eve of a departure in disguise, he had broken old nest and old relations,
and was now as a stranger in a city that he knew well, and where by not a few he was known.
The room that he turned into had little sign of old, well-liked occupancy; the servant who
at his call entered from a smaller chamber was not the man to whom he was used, but a Highlander
sent him by a Gordon then in Paris.

"I am back, Donal!" said Ian, and threw himself into a chair by the table. "Come, give an account
of your errands!"

Donal, middle-aged, faithful, dour and sagacious, and years away from loch and mountain, gave
account. Such keep had been returned so has viz. and with violence, that she had conducted likewise

 She was clear of him--the laird could reproach her
with nothing!

What had happened? He had told her how, at need, a letter might be sent. But one had never
come. He himself had never written. Writing was set in a prickly ring of difficulties and dangers.
What had happened? Strong, secret inclination toward finding least painful things for himself
brought his conclusion. Sitting there in the sunshine, his will deceiving him, he determined
that it was simply that Elspeth had at last told Glenfernie that she could not love him because
she loved another. Probably--persistence being markedly a trait of Old Steadfast's--he had
been after her once and again, and she had turned upon him and said much more than in prudence
she should have said! So Alexander would have made his discovery and might, if he pleased,
image other trysts than his own in the glen! Certainly he had done this, and then sat down
and penned his challenge!

Elspeth! He was unshakably conscious that Glenfernie would tell none what Elspeth might have
been provoked into giving away. Old Steadfast, there was no denying, had that knightliness.
Three now knew--no more than three. If, through some mischance, there had been wider discovery,
she would have written! The Black Hill letter, too, would have had somewhat there to say.

Then, behind the challenge, stood old and new relations between Ian Rullock and Alexander Jardine!
It was what Glenfernie might choose to term the betrayal of friendship--a deep scarification
of Old Steadfast's pride, a severing cut given to his too imperial confidence, poison dropped
into the wells of domination, "No!" said to too much happiness, to any surpassing of him, Ian,
in happiness, "No!" to so much reigning!

Ian shook himself, thrust away the doubtful glimmer of a smile. That way really did lie hell....

He came back to a larger if a much perplexed self. He could not meet Glenfernie on that sea
beach, fight him there. He did not desire to kill Old Steadfast, though, as the world went,
pleasure was to be had in now and then giving superiority pain. You had it was served to what had been

 "It is not likely, sir, that he divulged that!"

"He? No! But fate--fortune--the unrolling course of things--plain Providence--whatever you
choose to call it--seems at times quite below or above that reticence which we others so naturally
prize and exhibit!"

"You'll oblige me, sir, by not speaking in riddles."

The irony dropped from Mr. Wotherspoon's tone. He faced the business squarely. "Do you mean
to say that you do not know of the suicide of Elspeth Barrow?"

The chair opposite made a grating sound, pushed violently back upon the bare, polished floor.
Down the street, through the window, came the sound of Cluny Macpherson's pipers, playing down
from the Lawnmarket. Rullock seemed to have thrust his chair back into the shadow. Out of it
came presently his voice, low and hoarse:

"No."

"They found her on Christmas Day--drowned in the Kelpie's Pool. Self-murder--murder also of
a child that would have been."

Again silence. The lawyer found that he must go through with it, having come so far. "It seems
that there is a cripple fellow of the neighborhood who had stumbled, unseen, upon your trysts.
He told--spoke it all out to the crowd gathered. There was a letter, too, upon her which gave
a clue. But she never named you and evidently meant not to name you.... Poor child! She may
have thought herself strong, and then things have come over her wave on wave. Her grandfather--that
dark upbringing on tenets harsh and wrathful--certainty of disgrace. Pitiful!"

There came a sound from the chair pushed back from the light. Mr. Wotherspoon measured the
table with his fingers.

"It seems that the countryside was searching for her. It was the laird of Glenfernie who, alone
and coming upon some trace, entered the Kelpie's Pool and found her there. They say that he
carried her, dead, in his arms through the glen to White Farm."

Some proclamation or other was being made at the Cross of Edinburgh. A trumpet blew and the
street was filled with footsteps.

"The laird of Glenfernie," said the lawyer, "has joined, I hear, Sir John Cope at Dunbar. It
is not impossible that you may have speech together from opposing battle-lines." He poured
wine. "My bag of news is empty, Captain Rullock."

Ian rose from his seat. His face was gray and twisted, his voice, when he spoke, hollow, low,
and dry. "I must go now to Lord George Murray.... It was all news, Mr. Wotherspoon. I--What
are words, anyhow? Give you good day, sir!"

Mr. Wotherspoon, standing in his door, watched him down the stair and forth from the house.
"He goes brawly! How much is night, and how much streak of dawn?"

       *       *       *       *       *

Sir John Cope, King George's general in Scotland, had but a small army. It was necessary in
the highest degree that Prince Charles Edward should meet and defeat this force before it was
enlarged, before from England came more and more regular troops.... A battle won meant prestige
gained, the coming over of doubting thousands, an echo into England that would bring the definite
accession of great Tory names. Cope and his twenty-five hundred men, regulars and volunteers,
approaching Edinburgh from the east, took position near the village of Prestonpans. On the
morning of the 20th of September out moved to meet him the Prince and Lord George Murray, behind
them less than two thousand men.

By afternoon the two forces confronted each the other; but Cope had chosen well, the right
position. The sea guarded one flank, a deep and wide field ditch full of water the other. In
his rear were stone walls, and before him a wide marsh. The Jacobite strength halted, reconnoitered,
must perforce at last come to a standstill before Cope's natural fortress. There was little
artillery, no great number of horse. Even the bravest of the brave, Highland or Lowland, might
draw back from the thought of trying to cross that marsh, of meeting the moat-like ditch under
Cope's musket-fire. Sunset came amid perturbation, a sense of check, impending disaster.

Ian Rullock, acting for the moment as aide-de-camp, had spent the day on horseback. Released
in the late afternoon, lodged in a hut at the edge of the small camp, he used the moment's
leisure to climb a small hill and at its height to throw himself down beside a broken cairn.
He shut his eyes, but after a few moments opened them and gazed upon the camp of Cope, covering
also but a little space, so small were the armies. His lips parted.

"Well, Old Steadfast, and what if you are there, waiting?..."

The sun sank. A faint red light diffused itself, then faded into brown dusk. He rose and went
down into the camp. In the brows of many there might be read depression, uncertainty. But in
open places fires had been built, and about several of these Highlanders were dancing to the
screaming of their pipes. Rullock bent his steps to headquarters. An officer whom he knew,
coming forth, drew him aside in excitement.

"We've got it--we've got it, Rullock!"

"What? The plan?"

"The way through! Here has come to the Prince the man who owns the marsh! He knows the firm
ground. Cope does not know that it is there! Cope thinks that it is all slough! This man swears
that he can and will take us across, one treading behind another. It's settled. When sleep
seems to wrap us, then we'll move!"

That was what was done, and done so perfectly, late at night, Sir John Cope sleeping, thinking
himself safe as in a castle. File after file wound noiselessly, by the one way through the
marsh, and upon the farther side, so near to Cope, formed in the darkness into battle-lines....
Ian Rullock, passing through the marsh, saw in imagination Alexander lying with eyes closed.

The small force, the Stewart hope, prepared for onslaught. The dawn was coming, there was a
smell of it in the air, far away a cock crowed. There stood, in the universal dimness, a first
and strongest line, a second and weaker, badly armed line. The mass of this army were Highlanders,
alert, strong, accustomed to dawn movements, dreamlike in the heather, along the glen-sides,
in the crooked pass. They knew the tactics of surprise. They had claymores and targes, and
the most muskets. But the second line had inadequate provision of weapons. Many here bore scythes
fastened to staves. As they carried these over their shoulders Ian, looking back, saw them
against the palest light like Death in replica.

The two lines hung motionless, on stout ground, now within the defense to which Cope had trusted,
very close to the latter's sleeping camp. There were sentries, but the night was dark, the
marsh believed to be unpassable, the crossing carried out with stealthy skill. But now the
night was going.

In the most uncertain, the faintest light, there seemed to Cope's watchers, looking that way,
a line of bushes not noted the day before. Officers were awakened. A movement ran through the
camp like the shiver of water under dawn wind. The light thickened. A trumpet rang with a startled,
emphatic note. Drums rolled. To arms! To arms! King George's army started up in the dawning.
Infantry hastened into ranks, cavalrymen ran to their horses. The line of bushes moved, began
to come forward with great rapidity.

The Highlanders flung themselves upon Cope's just-forming cavalry. With their claymores they
slashed at the faces of horses. The hurt beasts wheeled, broke for the rear. Their fellows
were wounded. Amid a whirlwind of blows, screams, shouts, with a suddenness that appalled,
disorder became general. The Highlanders seemed to fight with a demoniac strength and ferocity
and after methods of their own. They used their claymores, their dirks, their scythes fastened
upon poles, against the horses, then, springing up, put long arms about the horsemen and, regardless
of sword or pistol, dragged them down. They shouted their Gaelic slogans; their costume, themselves,
seemed out of a fiercer, earlier world. A strangeness overclouded the senses; mist wreaths
were everywhere, and an uncertainty as to the numbers of demons.... The cavalry broke. Officers
tried to save the situation, to rally the units, to save all from being borne back. But there
was no helping. Befell a panic flight, and at its heels the Highland rush streamed into and
had its way with Cope's infantry. The battle was won with a swift and horrible completeness
and became a massacre. Not much quarter was given; much that was horrible was done and seen.
Immoderate victory sat and sang to the white-cockaded army.

Out of the mist-bank before Captain Ian Rullock grew a great horse with a man upon it of great
stature and frame. It came to the Jacobite like a vision, with a startling and intense reality.
He was standing with his sword drawn; there was a drift of mist, and then there was the horse
and rider--there was Alexander.

He looked down at Ian, and his face was not pale but set. He made a gesture that seemed full
of satisfaction, and would have dismounted and drawn his sword. But there came a dash of maddened
horses and their riders and a leaping stream of tartaned men. These drove like a wedge between;
his horse wheeled, would leave no more its fellows; the tide of brute and man bore him away
with it. Ian watched all go fighting by, a moving frieze, out of the mist into the mist.

CHAPTER XX

A triumphant Stewart went back to Holyrood, an exultant army, calling itself, now with some
good show of bearing it through, the "royal" army, carried into Edinburgh its confident step
and sanguine hue. Victory was with the old line, the magnificent attempt! The erstwhile doubting
throng began, stage by stage, to mount toward enthusiasm. It was the quicker done that Charles
Edward, or his wisest advisers, put forth a series of judicious civic and public measures.
And, now that Cope had fled, King George had in Scotland no regular troops. Every day there
came open accessions to the Prince's strength. The old Stewarts up again became a magnet, drawing
more and more the filings. The Prince had presently between five and six thousand troops. The
north was his, Edinburgh, the Jacobites scattered through the Lowlands. The moderate Whig and
Presbyterian might begin to think of compounding, of finding virtues in necessity. The irreconcilables
felt great alarm and saw coming upon them a helplessness.

But the Stewarts, with French approval behind, aimed at the recovery of England no less than
Scotland. Windsor might well overdazzle Holyrood. This interest had received many and strong
protestations of support from a wide swathe of English nobility and gentry. Lift the victorious
army over the border, set it and the young Prince bodily upon English ground, would not great
family after great family rouse its tenants, arm them, join the Prince? So at least it seemed
to the flushed Stewart hope. King George was home from Hanover, British troops being brought
back from the Continent. Best to fan high the fire of the rising while it might with most ease
be fanned--best to march as soon as might be into England!

On the 1st of November they marched, three detachments by three roads, and the meeting-place
Carlisle. All went most merrily well. On the 10th of November began the siege of Carlisle.
The Prince had cannon now, some taken at Prestonpans, some arrived, no great time before, from
France, first fruits of French support. The English General Wade was at Newcastle with a larger
army than that of the Jacobites. But the siege of Carlisle was not lifted by Wade. After three
days city and castle surrendered. Charles Edward and his army entered England.

From Carlisle they marched to Penrith--to Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Manchester--clear, well-conducted
marches, the army held well together and in hand, here and there handfuls of recruits. But
no flood of loyally-shouting gentry, no bearers of great names drawing the sword for King James
III and a gallant, youthful Regent! Each dawn said they will come! Each eve said they have
not come! One month from leaving Edinburgh found this army of Highland chiefs and their clans,
Lowland Scots, a few Englishmen, a few Irishmen, and a few Frenchmen, led by skilful enough
generals and by a Prince the great-grandson of Charles I, deep in England, but little advanced
in bulk for all that. 'gold is to have not developed the names desire none, does not sail already.

 For a long time now he had been pledged
to personal daring, to thought forced to become supple and concentrated, to hard, practical
planning, physical hardship and danger. In the midst of this had begun to grow up a criticism
of all the enterprises upon which he was engaged. Scope--in many respects the Jacobite character,
generally taken, was amiable and brave, but its prime exhibit was not scope! Somewhat narrow,
somewhat obsolete; Ian's mind now saw Jacobitism in that light. As he sat without his rock
fortress, in the shadow of birch-trees, with lower hills and glens at his feet, he had a pale
vision of Europe, of the world. Countries and times showed themselves contiguous. "Causes,"
dynastic wars, political life, life in other molds and hues, appeared in chords and sequences
and strokes of the eye, rather than in the old way of innumerable, vivid, but faintly connected
points. "I begin to see," thought Ian, "how things travel together, like with like!" His body
was rested, recovered, his mind invigorated. He had had with him for long days the very elixir
of solitude. Relations and associations that before had been banked in ignorance came forth
and looked at him. "You surely have known us before, though you had forgotten that you knew
us!" He found that he was taking delight in these expansions of meaning. He thought, "If I
can get abroad out of this danger, out of old circles, I'll roam and study and go to school
to wider plans!" He suddenly thought, "This kind of thing is what Old Steadfast meant when
he used to say that I did not see widely enough." He moved sharply. A hot and bitter flood
seemed to well up within him. "He himself is seeing narrowly now--Alexander Jardine!"

He left the crag and went for a scrambling and somewhat dangerous walk along the mountain-side.
There was peril in leaving that one rock-curtained place. Two days before he had seen what
he thought to be signs of red-coated soldiers in the glen far below. But he must walk--he must
exercise his body, note old things, not give too much time to new perceptions! He breathed
the keen, sweet mountain air; with a knife that he had he fell to making a staff from a young
oak; he watched the pass below and the shadows of the clouds; he climbed fairly to the mountain-top
and had a great view; he sang an old song, not aloud, but under his breath; and at last he
must come back with solitude to his fastness. And here was brooding thought again!

Two more days passed. The man from the hut below in the pass came at dusk with food carefully
sent from the chieftain's hall. Redcoats had gone indeed through the glen, but they could never
find the path to this place! They might return or they might not; they were like the devil
who rose by your side when you were most peaceful! Angus went down the mountain-side. The sound
of his footstep died away. Ian had again Solitude herself.

Another day and night passed. He watched the sun climb toward noon, and as the day grew warm
he heard a step upon the hidden path. With a pistol in either hand he moved, as stealthily,
as silently as might be, to a platform of rock that overhung the way of the intruder. In another
moment the latter was in sight--one man climbing steadily the path to the old robber fastness.
He saw that it was Glenfernie. No one followed him. He came on alone.

Rullock put by his pistols and, moving to a chair of rock, sat there. The other's great frame
rose level with him, stepped upon the rocky floor. Ian had been growing to feel an anger at
solitude. When he saw Alexander he had not been able to check an inner movement of welcome.
He felt an old--he even felt a new--affection for the being upon whom, certainly, he had leaned.
There flowed in, in an impatient wave, the consideration that he must hate....

But Glenfernie hated. Ian rose to face him.

"So you've found your way to my castle? It is a climb! You had best sit and rest yourself.
I have my sword now, and I will give you satisfaction."

Glenfernie nodded. He sat upon a piece of fallen rock. "Yes, I will rest first, thank you!
I have searched since dawn, and the mountain is steep. Besides, I want to talk to you."

Ian brought from his cupboard oat-cake and a flask of brandy. The other shook his head.

"I had food at sunrise, and I drank from a spring below."

"Very good!"

The laird of Glenfernie sat looking down the mountain-sides and over to far hills and moving
clouds, much as he used to sit in the crook of the old pine outside the broken wall at Glenfernie.
There was a trick of posture when he was at certain levels within himself. Ian knew it well.

"Perhaps I should tell you," said Alexander, "that I came alone through the pass and that I
have been alone for some days. If there are soldiers near I do not know of them."

"It is not necessary," answered Ian. While he spoke he saw in a flash both that his confidence
was profound that it was not necessary, and that that incapacity to betray that might be predicated
of Old Steadfast was confined to but one of the two upon this rock. The enlightenment stung,
then immediately brought out a reaction. "To each some specialty in error! I no more than he
am monstrous!" There arose a desire to defend himself, to show Old Steadfast certain things.
He spoke. "We are going to fight presently--"

"Yes."

"That's understood. Now listen to me a little! For long years we were together, friends near
and warm! You knew that I saw differently from you in regard to many things--in regard, for
instance, to women. I remember old discussions.... Well, you differed, and sometimes you were
angry. But for all that, friendship never went out with violence! You knew the ancient current
that I swam in--that it was narrower, more mixed with earth, than your own! But you were tolerant.
You took me as I was.... What has developed was essentially there then, and you knew it. The
difference is that at last it touched what you held to be your own. Then, and not till then,
the sinner became anathema!"

"In some part you say truth. But my load of inconsistency does not lighten yours of guilt."

"Perhaps not. We were friends. Five-sixths of me made a fair enough friend and comrade. We
interlocked. You had gifts and possessions I had not. I liked the oak-feeling of you--the great
ship in sail! In turn, I had the key, perhaps, to a few lands of bloom and flavor that you
lacked. We interchanged and thought that we were each the richer. Five-sixths.... Say, then,
that the other sixth might be defined as no-friend, or as false friend! Say that it was wilful,
impatient of superiorities, proud, vain, willing to hurt, betray, and play the demon generally!
Say that once it gave itself swing it darkened some of the other sixths.... Well, it is done!
Yet there was gold. Perhaps, laird of Glenfernie, there is still gold in the mine!"

"You are mistaken in your proportions. Gold! You are to me the specter of the Kelpie's Pool!"

Silence held for a minute or two. The clouds, passing between earth and sun, made against the
mountain slopes impalpable, dark, fantastic shapes. An eagle wheeled above its nest at the
mountain-top. Ian spoke again. His tone had altered.

"If I do not decline remorse, I at least decline the leaden cope of it you would have me wear!
There is such a thing as fair play to oneself! Two years ago come August Elspeth Barrow and
I agreed to part--"

"Oh, 'agreed'--"

"Have it so! I said that we must part. She acquiesced--and that without the appeals that the
stage and literature show us. Oh, doubtless I might have seen a pierced spirit, and did not,
and was brute beast there! But one thing you have got to believe, and that is that neither
of us knew what was to happen. Even with that, she was aware of how a letter might be sent,
with good hope of reaching me. She was not a weak, ignorant girl.... I went away, and within
a fortnight was deep in that long attempt that ends here. I became actively an agent for the
Prince and his father. A hundred names and their fates were in my hands. You can fill in the
multitude of activities, each seeming small in itself, but the whole preoccupying every field....
If Elspeth Barrow wrote I never received her letter. When my thought turned in that direction,
it saw her well and not necessarily unhappy. Time passed. For reasons, I ceased to write home,
and again for reasons I obliterated paths by which I might be reached. For months I heard nothing,
as I said nothing. I was on the very eve of quitting Paris, under careful disguise, to go into
Scotland. But-- bad-dark.

"Wetmore it spoke of atelier, With paris." I reach you was anything most

"Saint Alison," he answered, "look full at what went on. Now tell me if those are wounds easy
to heal. And tell me if he were not less than a man who pocketed the injury, who said to the
injurer, 'Go in peace!'"

She looked at him mournfully. "Is it to pocket the injury? Will not all combine--silently,
silently--to teach him at last? Less than man--man--more than man, than to-day's appearing
man?... I am not wise. For yourself and the ring of your moment you may be judging inevitably,
rightly.... But with what will you overcome--and in overcoming what will you overcome?"

He made a gesture of impatience. "Oh, friend, once I, too, could be metaphysical! I cannot now."

Speech failed between them. They sat with eyes upon the garden, the old tree, the August blue
sky, but perhaps they hardly saw these. At last she turned. She had a slender, still youthful
figure, an oval, lovely, still young face. Now there was a smile upon her lips, and in her
eyes a light deep, touching, maternal.

"Go as you will, hunt him as you will, do what you will! And he, too--Ian! Ian and his sins.
Grapes in the wine-press--wheat beneath the flail--ore in the ardent fire, and over all the
clouds of wrath! Suffering and making to suffer--sinning and making to sin.... And yet will
the dawn come, and yet will you be reconciled!"

"Not while memory holds!"

"Ah, there is so much to remember! Ian has so much and you have so much.... When the great
memory comes you will see. But not now, it is apparent, not now! So go if you will and must,
Alexander, with the net and the spear!"

"Did he not sin?"

"Yes."

"I also sin. But my sin does not match his! God makes use of instruments, and He shall make
use of me!"

"If He 'shall,' then He shall. Let us leave talk of this. Where you go may love and light go,
too--and work it out, and work it out!"

He did not stay long in her garden. All Black Hill oppressed him now. The dark crept in upon
the light. She saw that it was so.

"He can be friends now with none. He sees in each one a partisan--his own or Ian's." She did
not detain him, but when he rose to say good-by helped him to say it without delay.

He went, and she paced her garden, thinking of Ian who had done so great wrong, and Alexander
who cried, "My enemy!" She stayed in the garden an hour, and then she turned and went to play
piquet with the lonely, shriveled man, her brother.

CHAPTER XXIV

Two days after this Glenfernie rode to White Farm. Jenny Barrow met him with exclamations.

"Oh, Mr. Alexander! Oh, Glenfernie! And they say that you are amaist as weel as ever--but to
me you look twelve years older! Eh, and this warld has brought gray into my hair! Father's
gane to kirk session, and Gilian's awa'."

He sat down beside her. Her hands went on paring apples, while her eyes and tongue were busy
elsewhere.

"They say you're gaeing to travel."

"Yes. I'm starting very soon."

"It's na said oot--but a kind of whisper's been gaeing around." She hesitated, then, "Are you
gaeing after him, Glenfernie?"

"Yes."

Jenny put down her knife and apple. She drew a long breath, so that her bosom heaved under
her striped gown. A bright color came into her cheeks. She laughed. "Aweel, I wadna spare him
if I were you!"

He sat with her longer than he had done with Mrs. Alison. He felt nearer to her. He could be
friends with her, while he moved from the other as from a bloodless wraith. Here breathed freely
all the strong vindications! He sat, sincere and strong, and sincere and strong was the countrywoman
beside him.

"Oh aye!" said Jenny. "He's a villain, and I wad gie him all that he gave of villainy!"

"That is right," said Alexander, "to look at it simply!" He felt that those were his friends
who felt in this as did he.

On the moor, riding homeward, he saw before him Jarvis Barrow. Dismounting, he met the old
man beside a cairn, placed there so long ago that there was only an elfin story for the deeds
it commemorated.

"Gude day, Glenfernie! So that Hieland traitor did not slay ye?" 

Had set you had he made, hung, "It would not be the world, wanderer,

 Now this--and this--is what you are to write in English."

The captive made a correct guess that not more than one or two of the captors could read Spanish,
and none at all English.

"Nevertheless, señor," said the chief, "you will know that if the gold is not put in that place
and after that fashion that I tell you, we shall let you die, and that not easily! So we think
that you will not make English mistakes any more than Spanish ones."

Ian nodded. He wrote the letter. Sancho put it in his bosom and with Pedro disappeared from
the dark ravine. The situation relaxed.

"You shall eat, drink, sleep, and be entirely comfortable, señor, until they return. If they
bring the gold you shall pursue your road at your pleasure even with a piece for yourself,
for we are nothing if not generous! If they do not bring it, why, then, of course--!"

Ian had long been bedfellow of wild adventure. He thought that he knew the mood in which it
was best met. The mood represented the grist of much subtle effort, comparing, adjustment,
and readjustment. He cultivated it now. The banditti admired courage, coolness, and good humor.
They had provision of food and wine, the sun still shone warm. The robber hold was set amid
dark, gipsy beauty.

The sun went down, the moon came up. Ian, lying upon shaggy skins, knew well that to-morrow
night--the night after at most--he might not see the sun descend, the moon arise. What then?

Alexander Jardine, sailing from Scotland, came to Lisbon a month after Ian Rullock. He knew
the name of the ship that had carried the fugitive, and fortune had it that she was yet in
this port, waiting for her return lading. He found the captain, learned that Ian had transhipped
north to Vigo. He followed. At Vigo he picked up a further trace and began again to follow.
He followed across Spain on the long road to France. He had money, horses, servants when he
needed them, skill in travel, a tireless, great frame, a consuming purpose. He made mistakes
in roads and rectified them; followed false clues, then turned squarely from them and obtained
another leading. He squandered upon the great task of dogging Ian, facing Ian, showing Ian,
again and again showing Ian, the wrong that had been done, patience, wealth of kinds, a discovering
and prophetic imagination. He traveled until at last here was the earth, climbing, climbing,
and before him the forested slopes, the mountain walls, the great partition between Spain and
France. An eagle would fly over it, and another eagle would follow him, for a nest had been
robbed and a friendship destroyed!

As the mountains enlarged he fell in with an Englishman of rank, a nobleman given to the study
of literature and peoples, amateur on the way to connoisseurship, and now traveling in Spain.
He journeyed en prince with his secretary and his physician, servants and pack-horses, and,
in addition, for at least this part of Spain, an armed escort furnished by the authorities,
at his proper cost, against just those banditti dangers that haunted this strip of the globe.
This noble found in the laird of Glenfernie a chance-met gentleman worth cultivating and detaining
at his side as long as might be. They had been together three or four days when at eve they
came to the largest inn of a town set at a short distance from the mountain pass through which
ran their further road. Here, at dusk, they dismounted in the inn-yard, about them a staring,
commenting crowd. Presently they went to supper together. The Englishman meant to tarry a while
in this town to observe certain antiquities. He might stay a week. He urged that his companion
of the last few days stay as well. But the laird of Glenfernie could not.

"I have an errand, you see. I am to find something. I must go on."

"Two days, then. You say yourself that your horses need rest."

"They do.... I will stay two days."

But when morning came the secretary and the physician alone appeared at table. The nobleman
lay abed with a touch of fever. The physician reported that the trouble was slight--fatigue
and a chill taken. A couple of days' repose and his lordship would be himself again.

Glenfernie walked through the town. Returning to the inn, he found that the Englishman had
asked for him. For an hour or two he talked or listened, sitting by the nobleman's bed. Leaving
him at last, he went below to the inn's great room, half open to the courtyard and all the
come and go of the place. It was late afternoon. He sat by a table placed before the window,
and the river seemed to flow by him, and now he looked at it from a rocky island, and now he
looked elsewhere. The room grew ruddy from the setting sun. An inn servant entered and busied
himself about the place. After him came an aged woman, half gipsy, it seemed. She approached
the seat by the window. Her worn mantle, her wide sleeve, seemed to touch the deep stone sill.
She was gone like a moth. Glenfernie's eye discovered a folded paper lying in the window. It
had not been there five minutes earlier. Now it lay before him like a sudden outgrowth from
the stone. He put out a hand and took it up. The woman was gone, the serving-man was gone.
Outside flowed the river. Alexander unfolded the paper. It was addressed to Señor Nobody. It
lay upon his knee, and it was Ian's hand. His lips moved, his vision blurred. Then came steadiness
and he read.

What he read was a statement, at once tense and whimsical, of the predicament of the writer.
The latter, recognizing the confusion of thought among his captors, wrote because he must,
but did not truly expect any aid from Señor Nobody. The writing would, however, prolong life
for two days, perhaps for three. If at the end of that time ransom were not forthcoming death
would forthcome. Release would follow ransom. But Señor Nobody truly could not be expected
to take interest! Most conceivably the stranger's lot must remain the stranger's lot. In that
case pardon for the annoyance! If, miraculously, the bearer did find Señor Nobody--if Señor
Nobody read this letter--if strangers were not strangers to Señor Nobody--if gold and mercy
lay alike in Señor Nobody's keeping--then so and so must be done. Followed three or four lines
of explicit directions. Did all the above come about, then truly would the undersigned, living,
and pursuing his journey into France, and making return to Señor Nobody when he might, rest
the latter's slave! Followed the signature, Ian Rullock.

Alexander sat by the window, in the rocky island, and the Spanish river flowed by. It was dusk.
Then came lights, and the English secretary and physician, with servants to lay the table and
bring supper. Glenfernie ate and drank with the two men. His lordship was reported better,
would doubtless be up to-morrow. The talk fell upon Greece, to which country the nobleman was,
in the end, bound. Greek art, Greek literature, Greek myth. Here the secretary proved scholar
and enthusiast, a liker especially of the byways of myth. He and Alexander voyaged here and
there among them. "And you remember, too," said the secretary, "the Cranes of Ibycus--"

They rose at last from table. Secretary and physician must return to their patron. "I am going
to hunt bed and sleep," said Glenfernie. "To-morrow, if his lordship is recovered, we'll go
see that church."

In the rude, small bedchamber he found his Spanish servant. Presently he would dismiss him,
but first, "Tell me, Gil, of the banditti in these mountains."

Gil told. The foreigner who employed him asked questions, referred intelligently from answer
to answer, and at last had in hand a compact body of information. He bade Gil good night. Ways
of banditti in any age or place were much the same!

The room was small, with a rude and narrow bed. There was a window, small, too, but open to
the night. Pouring through this there entered a vagrant procession of sound, with, in the interstices,
a silence that had its own voice. As the night deepened the procession thinned, at last died away.

When he undressed he had taken the letter to Señor Nobody and put it upon the table. Now, lying
still and straight upon the bed in the dark room, there seemed a blacker darkness where it
lay, four feet from him, a little above the level of his eyes. There it was, a square, a cube,
of Egyptian night, hard, fierce, black, impenetrable.

For a long time he kept a fixed gaze upon it. Beyond and above it glimmered the window. The
larger square at last drew his eyes. He lay another long while, very still, with the window
before him. Lying so, thought at last grew quiet, hushed, subdued. Very quietly, very sweetly,
like one long gone, loved in the past, returning home, there slipped into view, borne upon
the stream of consciousness, an old mood of stillness, repose, dawn-light by which the underneath
of things was seen. Once it had come not infrequently, then blackness and hardness had whelmed
it and it came no more. He had almost forgotten the feel of it.

Presently it would go.... It did so, finding at this time a climate in which it could not long
live. But it was powerfully a modifier.... Glenfernie, dropping his eyes from the window, found
the square that was the letter, a square of iron gray.

A part of the night he lay still upon the narrow bed, a part he spent in slow walking up and
down the narrow room, a part he stood motionless by the window. The dawn was faintly in the
sky when at last he took from beneath the pillow his purse and a belt filled with gold pieces
and sat down to count them over and compare the total with the figures upon a piece of paper.
This done, he dressed, the light now gray around him. The letter to Señor Nobody lay yet upon
the table. At last, dressed, he took it up and put it in the purse with the gold. Leaving the
room, he waked his servant where he lay and gave him directions. A faint yellow light gleamed
in the lowest east.

He waited an hour, then went to the room where slept the secretary and the physician. They
were both up and dressing. The physician had been to his patron's room. "Yes, his lordship
was better--was awake--meant after a while to rise." Glenfernie would send in a request. Something
had occurred which made him very desirous to see his lordship. If he might have a few minutes--?
The secretary agreed to make the inquiry, went and returned with the desired invitation. Glenfernie
followed him to the nobleman's chamber and was greeted with geniality. Seated by the Englishman's
bed, he made his explanation and request. He had so much gold with him--he showed the contents
of the belt and purse--and he had funds with an agent in Paris and again funds in Amsterdam.
Here were letters of indication. With a total unexpectedness there had come to him in this
town a call that he could not ignore. He could not explain the nature of it, but a man of honor
would feel it imperative. But it would take nicely all his gold and so many pieces besides. "me begin

 Then what he had prated of had been true! There
was a great difference between talking of and touching truth....

But he could not hold the touch. The wings flagged, he fell into the jungle of words. His body
turned upon the steps. The caves and dens of his being began to echo with cries and counter-cries.

Hurt? Had she not been hurt at all? But she was hurt--poisoned, ruined, drawn to death! Had
she long and wide and living power to heal her own harm? Still was it not there--he would have
it there!

Ian Rullock! With a long, inward, violent recoil Alexander shrank into the old caves of himself.
All, the magic web of color and fragrance dwindled, came to be a willow basket filled with
White Farm flowers placed upon the kirkyard steps.

Ian Rullock had stolen her--Ian, not Alexander, had been her lover, kissed her, clasped her,
there in the glen! Ian, the Judas of friendship--thief of a comrade's bliss--cheat, murderer,
mocker, and injurer!

The wave of oneness fled.

Glenfernie, looking like the old laird his father, his cloak wrapped around him, feeling the
December air, left the river steps, wandered away through Paris.

But when he was alone with the night he tried to recover the wave. It had been so wonderful.
Even the faint, faint echo, the ghostly afterglow, were exquisite; were worth more than anything
he yet had owned. He tried to recover the earlier part of the wave, separating it from the
later flood that had seemed critical of righteous wrath, just punishment. But it would not
come back on those terms.... But yet he wanted it, wanted it, longed for it even while he warred
against it.

CHAPTER XXVII

That was one December. The year made twelve steps and here was December again. With it came
to Ian a proffer from the nobleman of the coach across the Seine. Some ancient business, whether
of soul or sense, carried him to Rome. Monsieur Ian Rullock--said to be for the moment banished
from a certain paradise--might find it in his interest to come with him--say as traveling companion.
Ian found it so. Monseigneur was starting at once. Good! let us start.

Ian despatched his servant to the lodging known to be occupied by the laird of Glenfernie.
The man had a note to deliver. Alexander took it and read:

     GLENFERNIE,--I am quitting Paris with the Duc
     de ----, for Rome.--IAN RULLOCK.

The man gone, Alexander put fire to the missive and burned it, after which he walked up and
down, up and down the wide, bare room. When some time had passed he came back to chair and
table, inkwell and pen, and a half-written letter. The quill drove on:

     ... None could do better by the estate than you--not I nor
     any other. So I beg of you to stay, dear Strickland, who
     have stayed by us so long!

There followed a page of business detail--inquiries--expressed wishes. Glenfernie paused. Before
him, propped against a volume of old lore, stood a small picture;--Orestes asleep in the grove
of the Furies. He sat leaning back in his chair, regarding it. He had found it and purchased
it months before, and still he studied it. His eyes fell to the page; he wrote on:

     You ask no questions, and yet I know that you question.
     Well, I will tell you--knowing that you will strain out and
     give to others only what should be given.... He has been,
     and I have been, in Paris a year. He and I have fought three
     times--fought, that is, as men call fighting. Once upon that
     mountain-side at home, twice here. Now he is going--and I am
     going--to Rome. Shall I fight him again--with metal digged
     from the earth, fashioned and sharpened in some red-lighted
     shop of the earth? I am not sure that I shall--rather, I
     think that I shall not.... Is there ever a place where a
     kind of growth does not go on? There is a moonrise in me
     that tells me that that fighting is to be scorned. But what
     shall I do, seeing that he is my foe?... Ah, I do not
     know--save haunt him, save bring and bring again my inner
     man, to clinch and wrestle with and throw, if may be, his
     inner man. And to see that he knows that I do this--that it
     tells back upon him--through and through tells back!... It
     has been a strange year. Now and then I am aware of curious
     far tides, effects from some giant orb of being. But I go
     on.... For my daily life in Paris--here it is, your open
     page!... You see, I still seek knowledge, for all your gibe
     that I sought darkness. And now, as I go to Rome--

He wrote on, changing now to details as to communication, placing of moneys, and such matters.
At length came references to the last home news, expressions of trust and affection. He signed
his name, folded, superscribed and sealed the letter, then sat on, studying the picture before him.

Monseigneur, with gold, with fine horses, with an eery, swooping, steadiness of direction,
journeyed fast. He and his traveling companion reached Rome early in February. There was a
villa, there were attendants, there was the Frenchman's especial circle, set with bizarre jewels,
princes of the Church, Italian nobles of his acquaintance, exiles, a charlatan of immense note,
certain ladies. He only asked of his guest, Monsieur Rullock, that he help him to entertain
the whole chaplet, giving to his residence in Rome a certain splendid virility.

February showed skies like sapphire. There drew on carnival week. Masks and a wildness of riot--childish,
too--

Ian leaned against the broken base of an ancient statue, set in the villa garden, at a point
that gave a famous view. Around, the almond-trees were in bloom. The marble Diana had gazed
hence for so many years, had seen so much that might make the dewy greenwood forgotten! It
was mid-afternoon and flooding light. Here Rome basked, half-asleep in a dream of sense; here
the ant city worked and worked.

Ian stood between tides, behind him a forenoon, before him an evening of carnival participation.
In the morning he had been with a stream of persons; presently, with the declining sun, would
be with another. Here was an hour or two of pause, time of day for rest with half-closed eyes.
He looked over the pale rose wave of the almonds, he saw Peter's dome and St. Angelo. He was
conscious of a fatigue of his powers, a melancholy that they gave him no more than they did.
"How it is all tinsel and falsetto!... I want a clean, cold, searching wave--desert and night--not
life all choked with wax tapers and harlequins! I want something.... I don't know what I want.
I only know I haven't got it!"

His arm moved upon the base of the statue. He looked up at the white form with the arrow in
its hands. "Self-containment.... What, goddess, you would call chastity all around?... All
the spilled self somehow centered. But just that is difficult--difficult--more difficult than
anything Hercules attempted. Oh me!" He sat down beneath the cypress that stood behind the
statue and rested his head within his hands. From Rome, on all sides, broke into the still
light trumpets and bell-ringing, pipes and drums, shout and singing. Me do not tell'she hate it had,
i had ta despise you is now; or she is here. Elspeth and had been sprinkled out of the great
night that she had sung he saw the and i was to air, the high-pitched she heard it was against heaven.
To ones, going. He talked-- dreams, had read with lightnings, the was never she may be thick lowland

 And together they were strong enough to
bring the gleaming back, watching the propitious moment. But still there was the opposed will,
and it was strong.... When the light came it sought out old traces of itself, and these became
revivified. Then all joined together to make a flood against the abundant darkness. A day like
this joined itself through likeness to others on the other side of the three years, and also
to moments of the months just passed and passing. Union was made with a sleepless night in
an inn of Spain, with the hours after his encounter with Ian in the Paris theater, with that
time he sat upon the river steps and saw that the dead were living and the prisoners free,
with the hour in the amphitheater and after, in carnival.

He saw and heard, felt and tasted, life in greater lengths and breadths. He comprehended more
of the pattern. The tones and semi-tones fell into the long scale. Such moments brought always
elevation, deep satisfaction.... More of the will particles traveled from below to the center
by the door.

The soul turned the mind and directed it upon Alexander Jardine's own history. It spread like
a landscape, like a continent viewed from the air, and here it sang with attainment and here
it had not attained; and here it was light, and here there were darknesses; right-doing here
and wrong-doing there and every shade between. He saw that there was right- and wrong-doing
quite outside of conventional standards.

Where were frontiers? The edges of the continent were merely spectral. Where did others end
and he begin, or he end and others begin? He saw that his history was very wide and very deep
and very high. Through him faintly, by nerve paths in the making, traveled the touch of oneness.

Alexander Jardine--Elspeth Barrow--Ian Rullock. And all others--and all others.

There swam upon him another great perspective. He saw Christ in light, Buddha in light. The
glorified--the unified. Union.

Alexander Jardine--Elspeth Barrow--Ian Rullock. And all others--and all others. For we are
members, one of another.

The feathered, flowered grass, miles of it, and the sea of air.... By degrees the level of
consciousness sank. The splendid, steadfast moment could not be long sustained. Consciousness
drew difficult breath in the pure ether, it felt weight, it sank. Alexander moved against the
old tomb, turned, and buried his face in his arms. The completer moment went by, here was the
torn self again. But he strove to find footing on the thickening impressions of all such moments.

Moving back to Rome, along the old way where had marched all the legions, by the ruins, under
the blue sky, he had a sense of going with Cæsar's legions, step by step, targe by targe, and
then of his footstep halting, turning out, breaking rhythm.... From this it was suddenly a
winter night and at Glenfernie, and he sat by the fire in his father's death-room. His father
spoke to him from the bed and he went to his side and listened to dying words, distilled from
a wide garden that had relaxed into bitterness, growths, and trails of ideal hatred.... What
was it, setting one's foot upon an adder?... What was the adder?

He entered the city. His lodging was above the workroom and shop of a recoverer of ancient
coins and intaglios, skilful cleanser and mender of these and merchant to whom would buy. The
man was artist besides, maker of strange drawings whom few ever understood or bought.

Glenfernie liked him--an elderly, fine, thin, hook-nosed, dark-eyed, subtle-lipped, little-speaking
personage. No great custom came to the shop in front; the owner of it might work all day in
the room behind, with only two or three peals of a small silvery summoning bell. The lodger
acquired the habit of sitting for perhaps an hour out of each twenty-four in this workroom.
He might study at the window gem or coin and the finish of old designs, or he might lift and
look at sheet after sheet of the man's drawings, or watch him at his work, or have with him
some talk.

The drawings had a fascination for him. "What did you mean behind this outward meaning? Now
here I see this, and I see that, but here I don't penetrate." The man laid down his mending
a broken Eros and came and stood by the table and spoke. Glenfernie listened, the wood propping
elbow, the hand propping chin, the eyes upon the drawing. Or he leaned back in the great visitor's
chair and looked instead at the draftsman. They were strange drawings, and the draftsman's
models were not materially visible.

To-day Glenfernie came from the noise of Rome without into this room. His host was sitting
before a drawing-board. Alexander stood and looked.

"Are you trying to bring the world of the plane up a dimension? Then you work from an idea
above the world of the solid?"

"Si. Up a dimension."

"What are these forms?"

"I am dreaming the new eye, the new ear, the new hand."

Glenfernie watched the moving and the resting hand. Later in the day he returned to the room.

"It has been a fertile season," said the artist. "Look!"

At the top of a sheet of paper was written large in Latin, LOVE IS BLIND. Beneath stood a figure
filled with eyes. "It is the same thing," said the man.

The next day, at sunset, going up to his room after restless wandering in this city, he found
there from Ian another intimation of the latter's movements:

     GLENFERNIE,--I am going northward. There will be a
     month spent at monseigneur's villa upon the Lake of Como.
     Then France again.--IAN RULLOCK.

Alexander laid the paper upon the table before him, and now he stared at it, and now he gazed
at space beyond, and where he gazed seemed dark and empty. It was deep night when finally he
dipped quill into ink and wrote:

     IAN RULLOCK,--Stay or go as you will! I do not
     follow you now as I did before. I come to see the crudeness,
     the barrenness, of that. But within--oh, are you not my
     enemy still? I ask Justice that, and what can she do but
     echo back my words? "Within" is a universe.--ALEXANDER
     JARDINE.

Five days later he knew that Ian with the Frenchman in whose company he was had departed Rome.
On that morning he went again without the city and lay among the grasses. But the sky to-day
was closed, and all dead Rome that had been proud or violent or a lover of self seemed to move
around him multitudinous. He fought the shapes down, but the sea in storm then turned sluggish,
dead and weary.... What was he going to do? Scotland? Was he going back to Scotland? The glen,
the moor, White Farm and the kirk, Black Hill and his own house--all seemed cold and without
tint, gray, small, and withered, and yet oppressive. All that would be importunate, officious.
He cried out, "O my God, I want healing!" For a long time he lay there still, then, rising,
went wandering by arches and broken columns, choked doorways, graved slabs sunken in fairy
jungles. Into his mind came a journey years before when he had just brushed a desert. The East,
the Out-of-Europe, called to him now.

 What was his was his.
What he deemed to be his, whether it was so or not! Touch him there and out jumped jealousy,
hate, and implacableness--and all the time one had been thinking of him as a kind of seer!

Ian turned upon the rock above Como. And Glenfernie was ignorant! The seer had seen very little,
after all. His touch had not been precisely permeative when it came to the world, Ian Rullock.
If liking meant understanding, there had not been much understanding--which left liking but
a word. If liking was a degree of love, where then had been love, where the friend at all?
After all, and all the time, Glenfernie's notion of friendship was a sieve. The notion that
he had held up as though it were the North Star!

The world, Ian Rullock, could not be so contemned....

He felt with heat and pain the truth of that. It was a wrong that Glenfernie should not understand!
The world, Ian Rullock, might be incomplete, imperfect--might have taken, more than once, wrong
turns, left its path, so to speak, in the heavens. But what of the world, Alexander Jardine?
Had it no memories? He brooded over what these memories might be--must be; he tried to taste
and handle that other's faults in time and space. But he could not plunge into Alexander's
depths of wrath. As he could not, he made himself contemptuous of all that--of Old Steadfast's
power of reaction!

A star shot across the moon-filled night, so large a meteor that it made light even against
that silver. A mass within Ian made a slow turn, with effort, with thrilling, changed its inclination.
He saw that disdain, that it was shallow and streaked with ebony. He moved with a kind of groan.
"Was there--is there--wickedness?... What, O God, is wickedness?"

He pressed the rock with his hand--sat up. The old taskmaster, alarmed, gathered his forces.
"I say that it is just that--pride, vengefulness, hard misunderstanding!"

A voice within him answered. -- famous fencing and go the treasure whom was finish; and Charlemagne

Starting from its home city, this caravan had been for two days in good spirits. Then had become
to creep in disaster, not excessive, but persistent. One thing and another befell, and at last
a stealing sickness, none knew what, attacking both beast and man. They had made the town at
the edge of the desert. Physicians were found and rest taken. Recuperation and trading proceeded
amicably together. The day of departure wheeling round, the noontide prayer was made with an
especial fervor and attention. Then from the caravanserai forth stepped the camels.

The sun descending, the caravan threw a giant shadow upon the sand. Ridge and wave of sterile
earth broke it, confused it, made it an unintelligible, ragged, moving, and monstrous shade.
The sun was red and huge. As it lowered to the desert rim Zeyn al-Din gave the order for the
seven-hour halt. The orb touched the sand; prayer carpets were spread.

Night of stars unnumbered, the ineffable tent, arched the desert. The caravan, a small thing
in the world, lay at rest. The meal was over. Here was coolness after heat, repose after toil.
The fires that had been kindled from scrub and waste lessened, died away. Zeyn al-Din appointed
the guards for the night, went himself the rounds.

Where one of the fires had burned he found certain of those men who were not merchants nor
servants of merchants, yet traveled with the caravan. Here were Hassan the Scribe, and Ali
the Wanderer, and the dervish Abdallah, and others. Here was the big Christian from some outlandish
far-away country, who had dwelt for the better part of a year in the city whence the caravan
started, who had money and a wish to reach the city toward which the caravan journeyed. In
the first city he had become, it seemed, well liked by Yusuf the Physician, that was the man
that Zeyn al-Din most admired in life. It was Yusuf who had recommended the Christian to Zeyn,
who did not like infidel sojourners with caravans. Zeyn himself was liberal and did not so
much mind, but he had had experience with troubles created along the way and in the column
itself. The more ignorant or the stiffer sort thought it unpleasing to Allah. But Zeyn al-Din
would do anything really that Yusuf the Physician wanted. So in the end the big Christian came
along. She can have supposed amply back. Was once he to drops, and have attuned of s was fearing in her

Much later, from his own room, Strickland, gazing forth, saw light in the keep. Alexander would
be sitting there among the books and every ancient memorial. Strickland felt a touch of doubt
and apprehension. Suppose that to-morrow should find not this Alexander, at once old and new,
but only the Alexander who had ridden from Glenfernie, who had shipped to Lisbon, nearly three
years ago? To-day's deep satisfaction only a dream! Strickland shook off the fear.

"He breathed lasting growth.... O Christ! the help for all in winged men!"

He turned to his bed. Lying awake he went in imagination to the desert, to the Eastern places,
that in few words the laird had painted.

And in the morning he found still the old-new Alexander. He saw that the new had always been
in the old, the oak in the acorn.... There was a great, sane naturalness in the alteration,
in the advance. Strickland caught glimpses of larger orders.

"I will make thee ruler over many things."

The day was deep and bright. The laird fell at once into the old routine. For none at Glenfernie
was there restlessness; there was only ache gone, and a feeling of fulfilling. Mrs. Grizel
pattered to and fro. Alice sang like a lark, gathering pansy seed from her garden. Phemie and
Eppie sang. The men whistled at their work. Davie discoursed to himself. But Tibbie Ross was
wild to get away early and to the village with the news. By the foot of the hill she began
to meet wayfarers.

"Oh, aye, this is the real weather! Did ye know--"

Alexander did not leave home that day. In their old work-room he listened to Strickland's account
of his stewardship.

"Strickland, I love you!" he said, when it was all given.

He wrote to Jamie; he sat in the garden seat built against the garden wall and watched Alice
as she moved from plant to plant.

"You do not say much," thought Alice, "but I like you--I like you--I like you!"

In the afternoon Strickland met him coming from the little green beyond the school-room.

"I have been out through the wall, under the old pine. I seemed to hold many things in the
palm of the hand.... I believe that you know what it is to make essences."

After bedtime Strickland saw again the light in the keep. But he had ceased to fear. "Oh All-Being,
how rich and stately and various and surprising you are!" In the morning, outside in the court,
he found Black Alan saddled.

"The laird will be riding to Black Hill," said Tam Dickson.

CHAPTER XXXII

Mr. Archibald Touris put out a wrinkled hand to his wine-glass. "You have been in warm countries.
I envy you! I wish that I could get warm."

"Black Hill is looking finely. All the young trees--"

"Yes. I took pride in planting.--But what for--what for--what for?" He shivered. "Glenfernie,
please close that window!"

Alexander, coming back, stood above the master of Black Hill. "Will you tell me, sir, where
Ian is now?"

Mr. Touris twitched back a little in his chair. "Don't you know? I thought perhaps that you did."

"I ceased to follow him two years ago. I dived into the East, and I have been long where you
do not hear from the West."

The other fingered his wine-glass. "Well, I haven't heard myself, for quite a while.... You
would think that he might come back to England now. But he can't. Doubtless he would never
wish to come again to Black Hill. But England, now.... But they are ferocious yet against every
head great and small of the attempt. And I am told there are aggravating circumstances. He
had worn the King's coat. He was among the plotters and instigators. He broke prison. Impossible
to show mercy!" Mr. Touris twitched again. "That's a phrase like a gravestone! If the Almighty
uses it, then of course he can't be Almighty.... Well, the moral is that none named Ian Rullock
can come again to Scotland or England."

"Have you knowledge that he wishes to do so?"

Mr. Touris moved again. "I don't know.... I told you that we hadn't heard. But--"

He stopped and sat staring into his wine-glass. Alexander read on as by starlight: "But I did
hear--through old channels. And there is danger of his trying to return."

The master of Black Hill put the wine to his lips. "And so you have been everywhere?"

"No. But in places where I had not been before."

"The East India has ways of gathering information. Through Goodworth I can get at a good deal
when I want to.... There is Wotherspoon, also. I am practically certain that Ian is in France."

"When did he write?"

"Alison has a letter maybe twice a year. One's overdue now."

"How does he write?"

"They are very short. He doesn't touch on old things--except, perhaps, back into boyhood. She
likes to get them. When you see her, don't speak of anything save his staying in France, as
he ought to." He dragged toward him a jar of snuff. "There are informers and seekers out everywhere.
Do you remember a man in Edinburgh named Gleig?"

"Yes."

"Well, he's one of them. And for some reason he has a personal enmity toward Ian. So, you see--"

He lapsed into silence, a small, aging, chilly, wrinkled, troubled man. Then with suddenness
a wintry red crept into his cheek, a brightness into his eyes. "You've changed so, Glenfernie,
you've cheated me! You are his foe yourself. Perhaps even--"

"Perhaps even--?"

The other gave a shriveled response to the smile. "No. I certainly did not mean that." He took
his head in his hands and sighed. "What a world it is! As I go down the hill I wish sometimes
that I had Alison's eyes.... Well, tell me about yourself."

"The one thing that I want to tell you just now, Black Hill, is that I am not any longer bloodhound
at the heels of Ian. What was done is done. Let us go on to better things. So at last will
be unknit what was done."

Black Hill both seemed and did not seem to pay attention. The man who sat before him was big
and straight and gave forth warmth and light. He needed warmth and light; he needed a big tree
to lean against. He vaguely hoped that Glenfernie was home to stay. He rubbed his hands and
drank more wine.

"No one has known for a long time where you were.... Goodworth has an agent in Paris who says
that Ian tried once to find out that."

"To find out where I was?"

"Yes."

Alexander gazed out of window, beyond the terrace and the old trees to the long hill, purple
with heath, sunny and clear atop.

A servant came to the door. "Mrs. Alison has returned, sir."

Glenfernie rose. "I will go find her then.--I will ride over often if I may."

"I wish you would!" said Black Hill. "I was sorry about that quarrel with your father."

The old laird's son walked down the matted corridor. The drawing-room door stood open; he saw
one panel of the tall screen covered with pagodas, palms, and macaws. Further on was the room,
clean and fragrant, known as Mrs. Alison's room. This door, too, was wide. He stood by his
old friend. They put hands into hands; eyes met, eyes held in a long look.

She said, "O God, I praise Thee!"

They sat within the garden door, on one side the clear, still room, on the other the green
and growing things, the great tree loved by birds. The place was like a cloister. He stayed
with her an hour, and in all that time there was not a great deal said with the outer tongue.
But each grew more happy, deeper and stronger.

He talked to her of the Roman Campagna, of the East and the desert....

As the hour closed he spoke directly of Ian. "That is myself now, as Elspeth is myself now.
I falter, I fail, but I go on to profounder Oneness."

"Christ is born, then he grows up."

"May I see Ian's last letters?"

She put them in his hands. "They are very short. They speak almost always of external things."

He read, then sat musing, his eyes upon the tree. "This last one--You answered that it was
not known where I was?"

"Yes. But he says here at the last, 'I feel it somewhere that he is on his way to Scotland.'"

"I'll have to think it out."

"Every letter is objective like this. But for all that, I divine, in the dark, a ferment....
As you see, we have not heard for months." 

"i wear'he partake how us were," a Lie. "you choose boy was that i said where he was shaken of duty, him

 Alexander brooded, brooded, his eyes upon the lessening flame. At last, with
a sudden movement, he rose. "I smell the morning air. Let us be going!"

The two covered the embers and left the cave. The moon stood above the western rim of the glen,
the sound of the water was deep and full, frost hung in the air, the trees great and small
stood quiet, in a winter dream. Ian and Alexander climbed the glen-side, avoiding Mother Binning's
cot. Now they were in open country, moving toward Black Hill.

The walk was not a short one. Daybreak was just behind the east when they came to the long
heath-grown hill that faced the house, the purple ridge where as boys they had met. They climbed
it, and in the east was light. Beneath them, among the trees, Black Hill showed roof and chimney.
Then up the path toward them came Peter Lindsay.

He seemed to come in haste and a kind of fear. When he saw the two he threw up his hands, then
violently gestured to them to go back upon their path, drop beneath the hilltop. They obeyed,
and he came to them himself, panting, sweat upon him for all the chill night. "Mr. Ian--Laird!
Sogers at the house--"

"Ah!"

"Twelve of them. They rade in an hour syne. The lieutenant swears ye're there, Mr. Ian, and
they search the house. Didna ye see the lights? Mrs. Alison tauld me to gae warn ye--"

CHAPTER XXXV

The soldiers, having fruitlessly searched Black Hill, for the present set up quarters there,
and searched the neighborhood. They gave a wide cast to that word. It seemed to include all
this part of Scotland. Before long they appeared, not unforeseen, at Glenfernie.

The lieutenant was a wiry, wide-nostriled man, determined to please superiors and win promotion.
He had now men at the Jardine Arms no less than men at Black Hill. Face to face with the laird
of Glenfernie in the latter's hall, he explained his errand.

"Yes," said Glenfernie. "I saw you coming up the hill. Will you take wine?"

"To your health, sir!"

"To your health!"

The lieutenant set down the glass and wiped his lips. "I have orders, Mr. Jardine, which I
may not disobey."

"Exactly so, Lieutenant."

"My duty, therefore, brings me in at your door--though of course I may say that you and your
household are hardly under suspicion of harboring a proscribed rebel! A good Whig"--he bowed
stiffly--"a volunteer serving with the Duke in the late trouble, and, last but not least, a
personal enemy of the man we seek--"

"The catalogue is ample!" said Glenfernie. "But still, having your orders to make no exception,
you must search my house. It is at your service. I will show you from room to room."

Lieutenant and soldiers and laird went through the place, high and low and up and down. "Perfunctory!"
said the lieutenant twice. "But we must do as we are told!"

"Yes," said the laird. "This is my sister's garden. The small building there is an old school-room."

They met Alice walking in the garden, in the winter sunshine. Strickland, too, joined them
here. Presentations over, the lieutenant again repeated his story.

"Perfunctory, of course, here--perfunctory! The only trace that we think we have we found in
a glen near you. There is a cave there that I understand he used to haunt. We found ashes,
still warm, where had been a fire. Pity is, the ground is so frozen no footstep shows!"

"You are making escape difficult," said Strickland.

"I flatter myself that we'll get him between here and the sea! I am going presently," said
the lieutenant, "to a place called White Farm. But I am given to understand that there are
good reasons--saving the lady's presence--why he'll find no shelter there."

"Over yonder is the old keep," said Glenfernie. "When that is passed, I think you will have
seen everything."

They left Strickland and Alice and went to the keep. Their footsteps and those of the soldiers
behind them rang upon the stone stairs.

"Above is the room," said the laird of Glenfernie, "where as a boy I used to play at alchemy.
I built a furnace. I had an intention of making lead into gold. I keep old treasures there
still, and it is still my dear old lair--though with a difference as I travel on, though with
a difference, Lieutenant, as we travel on!"

They came into the room, quiet, filled with books and old apparatus, with a burning fire, with
sunlight and shadow dappling floor and wall. "Well, he would hardly hide here!" said the lieutenant.

"Not by received canons," answered Glenfernie.

The lieutenant spoke to the soldiers. "Go about and look beneath and behind matters. There
are no closets?"

"There are only these presses built against the stone." The laird opened them as he spoke.
"You see--blank space!" He moved toward a corner. "This structure is my ancient furnace of
which I spoke. I still keep it fuel-filled for firing." As he spoke he opened a sizable door.

The lieutenant, stooping, saw the piled wood. "I don't know much of alchemy," he said. "I've
never had time to get around to those things. It's bringing out sleeping values isn't it?"

"Something like that." He shut the furnace door, and they stood watching the soldiers search
the room. In no long time this stood a completed process.

"Perfunctory!" said again the lieutenant. "Now men, we'll to White Farm!"

"There is food and drink for them below, on this chilly day," said the laird, "and perhaps
in the hall you'll drink another glass of wine?"

All went down the stairs and out of the keep. Another half-hour and the detail, lieutenant
and men, mounted and rode away. Glenfernie and Strickland watched them down the winding road,
clear of the hill, out upon the highway.

Alexander went back alone to the keep that, also, from its widened loopholes, might watch the
searchers ride away. He mounted the stair; he came into his old room. Ian stood beside the
table. The sizable furnace door hung open, the screen of heaped wood was disarranged.

"It was a good notion, that recess behind my old furnace!" said Glenfernie. "You took no harm
beyond some cobwebs and ashes?"

"None, Señor Nobody," said Ian.

That day went by. The laird and Strickland talked together in low voices in the old school-room.
Davie, too, appeared there once, and an old, trusted stableman. At sunset came Robin Greenlaw,
and stayed an hour. The stars shone out, around drew a high, windy crystal night.

Mrs. Grizel went to bed. Alexander, with Alice and Strickland, sat by the fire in the hall.
There was much that the laird wished to say that he said. They spoke in low voices, leaning
toward the burning logs, the light playing over their faces, the light laughing upon old armor,
crossed weapons, upon the walls. Alice, a bonny woman with sense and courage, sat beside Glenfernie.
Strickland, from his corner, saw how much she looked like her mother; how much, to-night, Alexander
looked like her.

They talked until late. They came to agreement, quiet, moved, but thorough. Glenfernie rose.
He took Alice in his arms and kissed her thrice. Moisture was in the eyes of both.

"Sleep, dear, sleep! So we understand, things grow easy!"

"I think that you are right, and that is a long way to comfort," said Alice. "Good night, good
night, Alexander!"

When she was gone the two men talked yet a little longer, over the dying fire. Then they, too,
wished each other good night. Strickland went to his room, but Alexander left the house and
crossed the moon-filled night to the keep. It was now he and Ian.

There was no strain. "Old Steadfast" and "Old Saracen," and a long pilgrimage together, and
every difference granted, yet, in the background, a vast, an oceanic unity.... Ian rose from
the settle. He and the laird of Glenfernie sat by the table and with pen and paper made a diagram
of escape. They bent to the task in hand, and when it was done, and a few more words had been
said, they turned to the pallets which Davie had spread on either side of the hearth. The moon
and the low fire made a strange half-light in the room. The two lay still, addressed to sleep.
They spoke and answered but once.

Said Ian: "I felt just then the waves of the sea!--The waves of the sea and the roads of France....
The waves and roads of the days and nights and months and years. I there and you here. There
is an ether, doubtless, that links, but I don't tread it firmly.... Be sure I'll turn to you,
call to you, often, over the long roads, from out of the trough of the waves! Señor Nobody!
Señor Nobody!" He laughed, but with a catch of the breath. "Good night!"

"Good night, Old Saracen!" said Alexander.

Morn came. That day Glenfernie House heard still that all that region was searched. The day
went by, short, gray, with flurries of snow. By afternoon it settled to a great, down-drifting
pall of white. It was falling thick and fast when Alexander Jardine and Ian Rullock passed
through the broken wall beyond the school-room. The pine branches were whitening, the narrow,
rugged path ran a zigzag of white.

Strickland had parted from them at the wall, and yet Strickland seemed to be upon the path,
following Glenfernie. Ian wore a dress of Strickland's, a hat and cloak that the countryside
knew. He and Strickland were nearly of a height. Keeping silence and moving through a dimness
of the descending day and the shaken veil of the snow, almost any chance-met neighbor would
have said, in passing, "Good day, Mr. Strickland!"

The path led into the wood. Trees rose about them, phantoms in the snowstorm. The snow fell
in large flakes, straight, undriven by wind. Footprints made transient shapes. The snow obliterated
them as in the desert moving sand obliterated. Ian and Alexander, leaving the wood, took a
way that led by field and moor to Littlefarm.

The earth seemed a Solitary, with no child nor lover of hers abroad. The day declined, the
snow fell. Ian and Alexander moved on, hardly speaking. The outer landscape rolled dimmed,
softened, withdrawn. The inner world moved among its own contours. The day flowed toward night,
as the night would flow toward day. 

Her led to exclamation why it began you have in she had, she hear, we

herself from t do.

 Alexander and Ian were left in the gray dawn.

"Alexander, I know the safe house and the safe man and the safe ship. Why should you run further
danger? Let us say good-by now!"

"No, not now."

"You have come to the edge of Scotland. Say farewell here, and danger saved, rather than on
the water stairs in a little while--"

"No. I will go farther, Ian. There is Mackenzie's house, over there."

They rode through the winter dawn to the house at the edge of the port, where lived a quiet
man and wife, under obligations to the Jardines. There visited them now the laird of Glenfernie
and his secretary, Mr. Strickland.

The latter, it seemed, was not well--kept his room that day. The laird of Glenfernie went about,
indeed, but never once went near the waterside.... And yet, at eve, the master of the Seawing,
riding in the harbor, took the resolution to sail by cockcrow. 

"but i love you," she append loudly. "i am merely idolise you!"

Xviii. But she could not assist wish large way for standing myself to his thus the. Cornelia, all-unconstipated,
"Preceptor'fight be ridiculous," and pull herself away of embracing
which her devotee had given about her.

They is already had some Title. maybough, when they shouted rearward
to her before a one else come; Cornelia could understand that her
have were rather charmian and are old, and that her am enation was
that specification of interest which do citizenry expression young
than they are after they have passed that most age.

She was thus good on the-- when she go off to Leadville to give charge
of private maybough'element course from the municipality where she
had ever had not populate, and stop out by wed laughing'element father.

From the magazine Macdonald Andrew maybough had still made and there lose several mischance

to be set by charmian execution, in the beginning; but he decease
needfully bad to that he left the widow of his second bigamy with
ebitda from a million, which she was to tranche during her afterlife
with the bairn of his first.

Mister. maybough travel afield with her countermeasure-girl, and a vengeance
of ghetto had been spend in Collection. There was any flood of Dresden
in their sojourn, something of Firenze, slackly same elderly of Paris;
it was not wholly desire in London, where Mrs. maybough was appeared
at tribunal.

 The boat that had brought them was gone. They
saw it in the moonlight, half-way back to the quay. On the Seawing, sailors were lifting anchor.
They stood and watched. The moon was paling; there came the scent of morning; far upon the
shore a cock crew. The Seawing's crew were making sail. Out and up went her pinions, filled
with a steady and favoring wind. She thrilled; she moved; she left the harbor for a new voyage,
fresh wonder of the eternal world.
