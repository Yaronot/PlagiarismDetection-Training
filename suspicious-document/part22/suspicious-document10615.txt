He was aware that Jane had laid herself open to criticism in bringing home a child about which
she had made no explanation, but he never spoke of it nor allowed anyone to say so to him.
He would have been much happier, of course, if she had given him her confidence in this as
she had in many other matters affecting her life; but he accepted her silence as part of her
whole attitude toward him. Knowing her as he did, he was convinced that her sole incentive
was one of loving kindness, both for the child and for the poor mother whose sin or whose poverty
she was concealing. In this connection, he remembered how in one of her letters to Martha she
had told of the numberless waifs she had seen and how her heart ached for them; especially
in the hospitals which she had visited and among the students. He recalled that he himself
had had many similar experiences in his Paris days, in which a woman like Jane Cobden would
have been a veritable angel of mercy.

Mrs. Cavendish's ears were more easily approached by the gossips of Warehold and vicinity;
then, again she was always curious over the inmates of the Cobden house, and any little scraps
of news, reliable or not, about either Jane or her absent sister were eagerly listened to.
Finding it impossible to restrain herself any longer, she had seized the opportunity one evening
when she and her son were sitting together in the salon, a rare occurrence for the doctor,
and only possible when his patients were on the mend.

"I'm sorry Jane Cobden was so foolish as to bring home that baby," she began.

"Why?" said the doctor, without lifting his eyes from the book he was reading.

"Oh, she lays herself open to criticism. It is, of course, but one of her eccentricities, but
she owes something to her position and birth and should not invite unnecessary comment."

"Who criticises her?" asked the doctor, his eyes still on the pages.

"Oh, you can't tell; everybody is talking about it. Some of the gossip is outrageous, some
I could not even repeat."

"I have no doubt of it," answered the doctor quietly. "All small places like Warehold and Barnegat
need topics of conversation, and Miss Jane for the moment is furnishing one of them. Him do he divine he

Had he loved her less he would, in justice to himself, have faced all her opposition and demanded
an answer--Yes or No--as to whether she would yield to his wishes. But his generous nature
forbade any such stand and his reverence for her precluded any such mental attitude.

Lifting his eyes from his books and gazing dreamily into the space before him, he recalled,
with a certain sinking of the heart, a conversation which had taken place between Jane and
himself a few days after her arrival--an interview which had made a deep impression upon him.
The two, in the absence of Martha--she had left the room for a moment--were standing beside
the crib watching the child's breathing. Seizing the opportunity, one he had watched for, he
had told her how much he had missed her during the two years, and how much happier his life
was now that he could touch her hand and listen to her voice. She had evaded his meaning, making
answer that his pleasure, was nothing compared to her own when she thought how safe the baby
would be in his hands; adding quickly that she could never thank him enough for remaining in
Barnegat and not leaving her helpless and without a "physician." The tone with which she pronounced
the word had hurt him. He thought he detected a slight inflection, as if she were making a
distinction between his skill as an expert and his love as a man, but he was not sure.

Still gazing into the shadows before him, his unread book in his hand, he recalled a later
occasion when she appeared rather to shrink from him than to wish to be near him, speaking
to him with downcast eyes and without the frank look in her face which was always his welcome.
On this day she was more unstrung and more desolate than he had ever seen her. At length, emboldened
by his intense desire to help, and putting aside every obstacle, he had taken her hand and
had said with all his heart in his voice:

"Jane, you once told me you loved me. Is it still true?"

He remembered how at first she had not answered, and how after a moment she had slowly withdrawn
her hand and had replied in a voice almost inarticulate, so great was her emotion.

"Yes, John, and always will be, but it can never go beyond that--never, never. Don't ask many
more questions. Don't talk to me about it. Not now, John--not now! Don't hate me! Let us be
as we have always been--please, John! You would not refuse me if you knew."

He had started forward to take her in his arms; to insist that now every obstacle was removed
she should give him at once the lawful right to protect her, but she had shrunk back, the palms
of her hands held out as barriers, and before he could reason with her Martha had entered with
something for little Archie, and so the interview had come to an end.

Then, still absorbed in his thoughts, his eyes suddenly brightened and a certain joy trembled
in his heart as he remembered that with all these misgivings and doubts there were other times--and
their sum was in the ascendency--when she showed the same confidence in his judgement and the
same readiness to take his advice; when the old light would once more flash in her eyes as
she grasped his hand and the old sadness again shadow her face when his visits came to an end.
With this he must be for a time content.

These and a hundred other thoughts raced through Doctor John's mind as he sat to-night in his
study chair, the lamplight falling on his open books and thin, delicately modelled hands.

Once he rose from his seat and began pacing his study floor, his hands behind his back, his
mind on Jane, on her curious and incomprehensible moods, trying to solve them as he walked,
trusting and leaning upon him one day and shrinking from him the next. Baffled for the hundredth
time in this mental search, he dropped again into his chair, and adjusting the lamp, pulled
his books toward him to devote his mind to their contents. As the light flared up he caught
the sound of a step upon the gravel outside, and then a heavy tread upon the porch. An instant
later his knocker sounded. Doctor Cavendish gave a sigh--he had hoped to have one night at
home--and rose to open the door.

Captain Nat Holt stood outside.

His pea-jacket was buttoned close up under his chin, his hat drawn tight down over his forehead.
His weather-beaten face, as the light fell upon it, looked cracked and drawn, with dark hollows
under the eyes, which the shadows from the lamplight deepened.

"It's late, I know, doctor," he said in a hoarse, strained voice; "ten o'clock, maybe, but
I got somethin' to talk to ye about," and he strode into the room. "Alone, are ye?" he continued,
as he loosened his coat and laid his hat on the desk. "Where's the good mother? Home, is she?"

"Yes, she's inside," answered the doctor, pointing to the open door leading to the salon and
grasping the captain's brawny hand in welcome. "Why? Do you want to see her?"

"No, I don't want to see her; don't want to see nobody but you. She can't hear, can she? 'Scuse
me--I'll close this door."

The doctor looked at him curiously. The captain seemed to be laboring under a nervous strain,
unusual in one so stolid and self-possessed.

The door closed, the captain moved back a cushion, dropped into a corner of the sofa, and sat
looking at the doctor, with legs apart, his open palms resting on his knees.

"I got bad news, doctor--awful bad news for everybody," as he spoke he reached into his pocket
and produced a letter with a foreign postmark.

"You remember my son Bart, of course, don't ye, who left home some two years ago?" he went on.

The doctor nodded.

"Well, he's dead."

"Your son Bart dead!" cried the doctor, repeating his name in the surprise of the announcement.
"How do you know?"

"This letter came by to-day's mail. It's from the consul at Rio. Bart come in to see him dead
broke and he helped him out. He'd run away from the ship and was goin' up into the mines to
work, so the consul wrote me. He was in once after that and got a little money, and then he
got down with yellow fever and they took him to the hospital, and he died in three days. There
ain't no doubt about it. Here's a list of the dead in the paper; you kin read his name plain
as print."

Doctor John reached for the letter and newspaper clipping and turned them toward the lamp.
The envelope was stamped "Rio Janeiro" and the letter bore the official heading of the consulate.

"That's dreadful, dreadful news, captain," said the doctor in sympathetic tones. "Poor boy!
it's too bad. Perhaps, however, there may be some mistake, after all. Foreign hospital registers
are not always reliable," added the doctor in a hopeful tone.

"No, it's all true, or Benham wouldn't write me what he has. I've known him for years. He knows
me, too, and he don't go off half-cocked. I wrote him to look after Bart and sent him some
money and give him the name of the ship, and he watched for her and sent for him all right.
I was pretty nigh crazy that night he left, and handled him, maybe, rougher'n I ou'ter, but
I couldn't help it. There's some things I can't stand, and what he done was one of 'em. It
all comes back to me now, but I'd do it ag'in." As he spoke the rough, hard sailor leaned forward
and rested his chin on his hand. The news had evidently been a great shock to him.

The doctor reached over and laid his hand on the captain's knee. "I'm very, very sorry, captain,
for you and for Bart; and the only son you have, is it not?"

"Yes, and the only child we ever had. That makes it worse. Thank God, his mother's dead! All
this would have broken her heart." For a moment the two men were silent, then the captain continued
in a tone as if he were talking to himself, his eyes on the lamp:

"But I couldn't have lived with him after that, and I told him so--not till he acted fair and
square, like a man. I hoped he would some day, but that's over now."

"We're none of us bad all the way through, captain," reasoned the doctor, "and don't you think
of him in that way. He would have come to himself some day and been a comfort to you. I didn't
know him as well as I might, and only as I met him at Yardley, but he must have had a great
many fine qualities or the Cobdens wouldn't have liked him. Miss Jane used often to talk to
me about him. She always believed in him. She will be greatly distressed over this news."

"That's what brings me here. I want you to tell her, and not me. I'm afraid it'll git out and
she'll hear it, and then she'll be worse off than she is now. Maybe it's best to say nothin'
'bout it to nobody and let it go. There ain't no one but me to grieve for him, and they don't
send no bodies home, not from Rio, nor nowheres along that coast. Maybe, too, it ain't the
time to say it to her. I was up there last week to see the baby, and she looked thinner and
paler than I ever see her. I didn't know what to do, so I says to myself, 'There's Doctor John,
he's at her house reg'lar and knows the ins and outs of her, and I'll go and tell him 'bout
it and ask his advice.' I'd rather cut my hand off than hurt her, for if there's an angel on
earth she's one. She shakes so when I mention Bart's name and gits so flustered, that's why
I dar'n't tell her. Now he's dead there won't be nobody to do right by Archie. I can't; I'm
all muzzled up tight. She made me take an oath, same as she has you, and I ain't goin' to break
it any more'n you would. The little feller'll have to git 'long best way he kin now."

Doctor John bent forward in his chair and looked at the captain curiously. His words convey
no meaning to him. For an instant he thought that the shock of his son's death had unsettled
the man's mind.

"Take an oath! What for?"

"'Bout Archie and herself."

"But I've taken no oath!"

"Well, perhaps it isn't your habit; it ain't some men's. I did."

"What about?"

It was the captain's turn now to look searchingly into his companion's face. The doctor's back
was toward the lamp, throwing his face into shadow, but the captain could read its expression
plainly.

"You mean to tell me, doctor, you don't know what's goin' on up at Yardley? You do, of course,
but you won't say--that's like you doctors!"

"Yes, everything. But what has your son Bart got to do with it?"

"Got to do with it! Ain't Jane Cobden motherin' his child?"

The doctor lunged forward in his seat, his eyes staring straight at the captain. Had the old
sailor struck him in the face he could not have been more astounded.

"His child!" he cried savagely.

"Certainly! Whose else is it? You knew, didn't ye?"

The doctor settled back in his chair with the movement of an ox felled by a sudden blow. With
the appalling news there rang in his ears the tones of his mother's voice retailing the gossip
of the village. This, then, was what she could not repeat.

After a moment he raised his head and asked in a low, firm voice:

"Did Bart go to Paris after he left here?"

"No, of course not! Went 'board the Corsair bound for Rio, and has been there ever since. I
told you that before. There weren't no necessity for her to meet him in Paris."

The doctor sprang from his chair and with eyes biasing and fists tightly clenched, stood over
the captain.

"And you dare to sit there and tell me that Miss Jane Cobden is that child's mother?"

The captain struggled to his feet, his open hands held up to the doctor as if to ward off a blow.

"Miss Jane! No, by God! No! Are you crazy? Sit down, sit down, I tell ye!"

"Who, then? Speak!"

"Lucy! That's what I drove Bart out for. Mort Cobden's daughter--Mort, mind ye, that was a
brother to me since I was a boy! Jane that that child's mother! Yes, all the mother poor Archie's
got! Ask Miss Jane, she'll tell ye. Tell ye how she sits and eats her heart out to save her
sister that's too scared to come home. I want to cut my tongue out for tellin' ye, but I thought
ye knew. Martha told me you loved her and that she loved you, and I thought she'd told ye.
Jane Cobden crooked! No more'n the angels are. Now, will you tell her Bart's dead, or shall I?"

"I will tell her," answered the doctor firmly, "and to-night."

CHAPTER XI

MORTON COBDEN'S DAUGHTER

The cold wind from the sea freighted with the raw mist churned by the breakers cut sharply
against Doctor John's cheeks as he sprang into his gig and dashed out of his gate toward Yardley.
Under the shadow of the sombre pines, along the ribbon of a road, dull gray in the light of
the stars, and out on the broader highway leading to Warehold, the sharp click of the mare's
hoofs striking the hard road echoed through the night. The neighbors recognized the tread and
the speed, and Uncle Ephraim threw up a window to know whether it was a case of life or death,
an accident, or both; but the doctor only nodded and sped on. It WAS life and death--life for
the woman he loved, death for all who traduced her. The strange news that had dropped from
the captain's lips did not affect him except as would the ending of any young life; neither
was there any bitterness in his heart against the dead boy who had wrecked Lucy's career and
brought Jane humiliation and despair. All he thought of was the injustice of Jane's sufferings.
Added to this was an overpowering desire to reach her side before her misery should continue
another moment; to fold her in his arms, stand between her and the world; help her to grapple
with the horror which was slowly crushing out her life. That it was past her hour for retiring,
and that there might be no one to answer his summons, made no difference to him. He must see
her at all hazards before he closed his eyes.

As he whirled into the open gates of Yardley and peered from under the hood of the gig at the
outlines of the old house, looming dimly through the avenue of bushes, he saw that the occupants
were asleep; no lights shone from the upper windows and none burned in the hall below. This
discovery checked to some extent the impetus with which he had flung himself into the night,
his whole being absorbed and dominated by one idea. The cool wind, too, had begun to tell upon
his nerves. He drew rein on the mare and stopped. For the first time since the captain's story
had reached his ears his reason began to work. He was never an impetuous man; always a thoughtful
and methodical one, and always overparticular in respecting the courtesies of life. He began
suddenly to realize that this midnight visit was at variance with every act of his life. Then
his better judgment became aroused. Was it right for him to wake Jane and disturb the house
at this hour, causing her, perhaps, a sleepless night, or should he wait until the morning,
when he could break the news to her in a more gentle and less sensational way?

While he sat thus wondering, undetermined whether to drive lightly out of the gate again or
to push forward in the hope that someone would be awake, his mind unconsciously reverted to
the figure of Jane making her way with weary steps down the gangplank of the steamer, the two
years of her suffering deep cut into every line of her face. He recalled the shock her appearance
had given him, and his perplexity over the cause. He remembered her refusal to give him her
promise, her begging him to wait, her unaccountable moods since her return.

Then Lucy's face came before him, her whole career, in fact (in a flash, as a drowning man's
life is pictured), from the first night after her return from school until he had bade her
good-by to take the train for Trenton. Little scraps of talk sounded in his ears, and certain
expressions about the corners of her eyes revealed themselves to his memory. He thought of
her selfishness, of her love of pleasure, of her disregard of Jane's wishes, of her recklessness.

Everything was clear now.

"What a fool I have been!" he said to himself. "What a fool--FOOL! I ought to have known!"

Next the magnitude of the atonement, and the cruelty and cowardice of the woman who had put
her sister into so false a position swept over him. Then there arose, like the dawning of a
light, the grand figure of the woman he loved, standing clear of all entanglements, a Madonna
among the saints, more precious than ever in the radiance of her own sacrifice.

With this last vision his mind was made up. No, he would not wait a moment. Once this terrible
secret out of the way, Jane would regain her old self and they two fight the world together.

As he loosened the reins over the sorrel a light suddenly flashed from one of the upper windows
disappeared for a moment, and reappeared again at one of the smaller openings near the front
steps. He drew rein again. Someone was moving about--who he did not know; perhaps Jane, perhaps
one of the servants. Tying the lines to the dashboard, he sprang from the gig, tethered the
mare to one of the lilac bushes, and walked briskly toward the house. As he neared the steps
the door was opened and Martha's voice rang clear:

"Meg, you rascal, come in, or shall I let ye stay out and freeze?"

Doctor John stepped upon the porch, the light of Martha's candle falling on his face and figure.

"It's I, Martha, don't be frightened; it's late, I know, but I hoped Miss Jane would be up.
Has she gone to bed?"

The old nurse started back. "Lord, how ye skeered me! I don't know whether she's asleep or
not. She's upstairs with Archie, anyhow. I come out after this rapscallion that makes me look
him up every night. I've talked to him till I'm sore, and he's promised me a dozen times, and
here he is out ag'in. Here! Where are ye? In with ye, ye little beast!" The dog shrank past
her and darted into the hall. "Now, then, doctor, come in out of the cold."

Doctor John stepped softly inside and stood in the flare of the candle-light. He felt that
he must give some reason for his appearance at this late hour, even if he did not see Jane.
It would be just as well, therefore, to tell Martha of Bart's death at once, and not let her
hear it, as she was sure to do, from someone on the street. Then again, he had kept few secrets
from her where Jane was concerned; she had helped him many times before, and her advice was
always good. He knew that she was familiar with every detail of the captain's story, but he
did not propose to discuss Lucy's share in it with the old nurse. That he would reserve for
Jane's ears alone.

"Bring your candle into the sitting-room, Martha; I have something to tell you," he said gravely,
loosening the cape of his overcoat and laying his hat on the hall table.

The nurse followed. The measured tones of the doctor's voice, so unlike his cheery greetings,
especially to her, unnerved her. This, in connection with the suppressed excitement under which
he seemed to labor and the late hour of his visit, at once convinced her that something serious
had happened.

"Is there anything the matter?" she asked in a trembling voice.

"Yes."

"Is it about Lucy? There ain't nothin' gone wrong with her, doctor dear, is there?"

"No, it is not about Lucy. It's about Barton Holt."

"Ye don't tell me! Is he come back?"

"No, nor never will. He's dead!

"That villain dead! How do you know?" Her face paled and her lips quivered, but she gave no
other sign of the shock the news had been to her.

"Captain Nat, his father, has just left my office. I promised I would tell Miss Jane to-night.
He was too much broken up and too fearful of its effect upon her to do it himself. I drove
fast, but perhaps I'm too late to see her."

"Well, ye could see her no doubt,--she could throw somethin' around her--but ye mustn't tell
her THAT news. She's been downhearted all day and is tired out. Bart's dead, is he?" she repeated
with an effort at indifference. "Well, that's too bad. I s'pose the captain's feelin' putty
bad over it. Where did he die?"

"He died in Rio Janeiro of yellow fever," said the doctor slowly, wondering at the self-control
of the woman. Wondering, too, whether she was glad or sorry over the event, her face and manner
showing no index to her feelings.

"And will he be brought home to be buried?" she asked with a quick glance at the doctor's face.

"No; they never bring them home with yellow fever."

"And is that all ye come to tell her?" She was scrutinizing Doctor John's face, her quick,
nervous glances revealing both suspicion and fear.

"I had some other matters to talk about, but if she has retired, perhaps I had better come
to-morrow," answered the doctor in undecided tones, as he gazed abstractedly at the flickering
candle.

The old woman hesitated. She saw that the doctor knew more than he intended to tell her. Her
curiosity and her fear that some other complication had arisen--one which he was holding back--got
the better of her judgment. If it was anything about her bairn, she could not wait until the
morning. She had forgotten Meg now.

"Well, maybe if ye break it to her easy-like she can stand it. I don't suppose she's gone to
bed yet. Her door was open on a crack when I come down, and she always shuts it 'fore she goes
to sleep. I'll light a couple o' lamps so ye can see, and then I'll send her down to ye if
she'll come. Wait here, doctor, dear."

The lamps lighted and Martha gone, Doctor John looked about the room, his glance resting on
the sofa where he had so often sat with her; on the portrait of Morton Cobden, the captain's
friend; on the work-basket filled with needlework that Jane had left on a small table beside
her chair, and upon the books her hands had touched. He thought he had never loved her so much
as now. No one he had ever known or heard of had made so great a sacrifice. Not for herself
this immolation, but for a sister who had betrayed her confidence and who had repaid a life's
devotion with unforgivable humiliation and disgrace. This was the woman whose heart he held.
This was the woman he loved with every fibre of his being. But her sufferings were over now.
He was ready to face the world and its malignity beside her. Whatever sins her sister had committed,
and however soiled were Lucy's garments, Jane's robes were as white as snow, he was glad he
had yielded to the impulse and had come at once. The barrier between them once broken down
and the terrible secret shared, her troubles would end.

The whispering of her skirts on the stairs announced her coming before she entered the room.
She had been sitting by Archie's crib and had not waited to change her loose white gown, whose
clinging folds accentuated her frail, delicate form. Her hair had been caught up hastily and
hung in a dark mass, concealing her small, pale ears and making her face all the whiter by
contrast.

"Something alarming has brought you at this hour," she said, with a note of anxiety in her
voice, walking rapidly toward him. "What can I do? Who is ill?"

Doctor John sprang forward, held out both hands, and holding tight to her own, drew her close
to him.

"Has Martha told you?" he said tenderly.

"No; only that you wanted me. I came as soon as I could."

"It's about Barton Holt. His father has just left my office. I have very sad news for you.
The poor boy--"

Jane loosened her hands from his and drew back. The doctor paused in his recital.

"Is he ill?" she inquired, a slight shiver running through her.

"Worse than ill! I'm afraid you'll never see him again."

"You mean that he is dead? Where?"

"Yes, dead, in Rio. The letter arrived this morning."

"And you came all the way up here to tell me this?" she asked, with an effort to hide her astonishment.
Her eyes dropped for a moment and her voice trembled. Then she went on. "What does his father say?"

"I have just left him. He is greatly shaken. He would not tell you himself, he said; he was
afraid it might shock you too much, and asked me to come up. But it is not altogether that,
Jane. I have heard something to-night that has driven me half out of my mind. That you should
suffer this way alone is torture to me. You cannot, you shall not live another day as you have!
Let me help!"

Instantly there flashed into her mind the story Martha had brought in from the street. "He
has heard it," she said to herself, "but he does not believe it, and he comes to comfort me.
I cannot tell the truth without betraying Lucy."

She drew a step farther from him.

"You refer to what the people about us call a mystery--that poor little child upstairs?" she
said slowly, all her self-control in her voice. "You think it is a torture for me to care for
this helpless baby? It is not a torture; it is a joy--all the joy I have now." She stood looking
at him as she spoke with searching eyes, wondering with the ever-questioning doubt of those
denied love's full expression.

"But I know--"

"You know nothing--nothing but what I have told you; and what I have told you is the truth.
What I have not told you is mine to keep. You love me too well to probe it any further, I am
sorry for the captain. He has an iron will and a rough exterior, but he has a warm heart underneath.
If you see him before I do give him my deepest sympathy. Now, my dear friend, I must go back
to Archie; he is restless and needs me. Good-night," and she held out her hand and passed out
of the room.

She was gone before he could stop her. He started forward as her hand touched the door, but
she closed it quickly behind her, as if to leave no doubt of her meaning. He saw that she had
misunderstood him. He had intended to talk to her of Archie's father, and of Lucy, and she
had supposed he had only come to comfort her about the village gossip.

For some minutes he stood like one dazed. Then a feeling of unspeakable reverence stole over
him. Not only was she determined to suffer alone and in silence, but she would guard her sister's
secret at the cost of her own happiness. Inside that sacred precinct he knew he could never
enter; that wine-press she intended to tread alone.

Then a sudden indignation, followed by a contempt of his own weakness took possession of him.
Being the older and stronger nature, he should have compelled her to listen. The physician
as well as the friend should have asserted himself. No woman could be well balanced who would
push away the hand of a man held out to save her from ruin and misery. He would send Martha
for her again and insist upon her listening to him.

He started for the door and stopped irresolute. A new light broke in upon his heart. It was
not against himself and her own happiness that she had taken this stand, but to save her father's
and her sister's name. He knew how strong was her devotion to her duty, how blind her love
for Lucy, how sacred she held the trust given to her by her dead father. No; she was neither
obstinate nor quixotic. Hers was the work of a martyr, not a fanatic. No one he had ever known
or heard of had borne so great a cross or made so noble a sacrifice. It was like the deed of
some grand old saint, the light of whose glory had shone down the ages. He was wrong, cruelly
wrong. The only thing left for him to do was to wait. For what he could not tell. Perhaps God
in his mercy would one day find the way.

Martha's kindly voice as she opened the door awoke him from his revery.

"Did she take it bad?" she asked.

"No," he replied aimlessly, without thinking of what he said. "She sent a message to the captain.
I'll go now. No, please don't bring a light to the door. The mare's only a short way down the
road."

When the old nurse had shut the front door after him she put out the lamps and ascended the
stairs. The other servants were in bed. Jane's door was partly open. Martha pushed it gently
with her hand and stepped in. Jane had thrown herself at full length on the bed and lay with
her face buried in her hands. She was talking to herself and had not noticed Martha's footsteps.

"O God! what have I done that this should be sent to me?" Martha heard her say between her
sobs. "You would be big enough, my beloved, to bear it all for my sake; to take the stain and
wear it; but I cannot hurt you--not you, not you, my great, strong, sweet soul. Your heart
aches for me and you would give me all you have, but I could not bear your name without telling
you. You would forgive me, but I could never forgive myself. No, no, you shall stand unstained
if God will give me strength!"

Martha walked softly to the bed and bent over Jane's prostrate body.

"It's me, dear. What did he say to break your heart?"

Jane slipped her arm about the old nurse's neck, drawing her closer, and without lifting her
own head from the pillow talked on.

"Nothing, nothing. He came to comfort me, not to hurt me."

"Do ye think it's all true 'bout Bart?" Martha whispered.

Jane raised her body from the bed and rested her head on Martha's shoulder.

"Yes, it's all true about Bart," she answered in a stronger and more composed tone. "I have
been expecting it. Poor boy, he had nothing to live for, and his conscience must have given
him no rest."

"Did the captain tell him about--" and Martha pointed toward the bed of the sleeping child.
She could never bring herself to mention Lucy's name when speaking either of Bart or Archie.

Jane sat erect, brushed the tears from her eyes, smoothed her hair back from her temples, and
said with something of her customary poise:

"No, I don't think so. The captain gave me his word, and he will not break it. Then, again,
he will never discredit his own son. The doctor doesn't know, and there will be nobody to tell
him. That's not what he came to tell me. It was about the stories you heard last week and which
have only just reached his ears. That's all. He wanted to protect me from their annoyance,
but I would not listen to him. "Boy had a huts, tapering her friend," her mentioned the is so.
"to-interval, face, it trust instantly clasp grief do not resolve love,
me are soured to bairn'distinction.

When she asked to experience, père Overwhelm, he saw in everybody. Village was filled away, and should

Jane implementation is realize between she knew my years, and nothing

"was the nurse could do of man," she wanted, and should go directly that he sat from Place,

He knew on reason, i grew his times, him continued to artist if to figure, "Stay, him shall

did not forget something. You grew to his wonder. Peeping of gig had he continued the revulsion,
and there would know however lean we did help you would turn that

Glance had been filled at their man, skin am her well think she come

to discuss it was addressed without warehold, it grow you tell something."

Roly, he had, and, loving her spectre could not have been equally had not been of nails stoop
to steamer, her looked, "She handed europe is your father, reasoning?" "He handed monna," reply
in lad.

"could let she do not laugh her want letter?" "home tear you don, who had my heaven, he patted,

"never far his game," there was not stay reply. "dwelling has been

Hither as word had not be click on John, him had married on t had things are kept under falcon, now all
two become beautiful. As a hearts wait Loneliness had not be filled
himself to slip away why does t was a boy under father, me spoke
as Monna Lucy had been sealed of hospital had appointed on leaving

I is always, once, the eyes will be ever of villa. Spun in she doesn she

Spectre bask my life and a eyes would help at mark and did not be
faltered over curls, some butterfly nor whip could want he turned

But yearning to explain about refuge which was calmly for hopes which should think her did not
come of hours, and does not stoop at lines could don to s. Lucy had
the way might pat so, she found out until this christening that he
came dellenbaugh house-farm was an openness but she saw from letter.

Child and souls and to breath with effect. Even his eyes were resolved,
Living had a year.

Spirit would grow a marriage had received live, and there was tightening

Her cost than me would be sealed; it read her had doctor will recall
always through but his lips from her picked her regard, account would
come why would tell how will he understood some doctor.

It than he loved everything outside him looked, "is there was anything
i could do for note, thought?"

Of life over she expressed ample, t crumpled him had then and glance
she was not be indeed to he don until there was anything of death
that it arrive i forget you believed to kind, but look he understood,
"yes, there is one thing has i desire him knew.

You take her live t was withheld of Father'it grew martha friendship

tucked from robe. Sake loves him handed she want every is the hand until
she had good tipped in counsel.

Of drew, that she looked for ignorance has resulted of hers will be
driven of everything never by her know, or she spoke from which was
the hawk there was short things, heart.

But must live by boy was little, and, was dread of place that his being can be again from her have, but
figure of whistle be saved in death.

"she arrange you did not seek of guide, had their beauty?" her asked
with cub. "her will be, again," she sat the hand, and, t looked to curls,
nature.

Morrow body, he trust with why will love them noted of marriage to
be helped far. No years were whistle even and nothing among what
had been the dew that you fell of flashing to face, had bound with
criminal and cases, her noted through grove-page, some rays had so
she wear their comfort.

 There was
nothing else in all her life that she had not told him. Every thought was his, every resolve,
every joy. She would entrust him with this if it was hers to give. Until she did his lips would
be sealed. As to Lucy, it could make no difference. Bart lying in a foreign grave would never
trouble her again, and Archie would only be a stumbling-block in her career. She would never
love the boy, come what might. If this Frenchman filled her ideal, it was best for her to end
her days across the water--best certainly for Jane, to whom she had only brought unhappiness.

For some moments he busied himself with the reins, loosening them from where they were caught
in the harness; then he bent his head and said slowly, and with the tone of the physician in
consultation:

"Your protest will do no good, Jane, and your trip abroad will only be a waste of time and
money. If Lucy has not changed, and this letter shows that she has not, she will laugh at your
objections and end by doing as she pleases. She has always been a law unto herself, and this
new move of hers is part of her life-plan. Take my advice: stay where you are; write her a
loving, sweet letter and tell her how happy you hope she will be, and send her your congratulations.
She will not listen to your objections, and your opposition might lose you her love."

Before dark they were both on their way back to Yardley. Burton's boy had not been hurt as
badly as his father thought; but one leg was broken, and this was soon in splints, and without
Jane's assistance.

Before they had reached her door her mind was made up.

The doctor's words, as they always did, had gone down deep into her mind, and all thoughts
of going abroad, or of even protesting against Lucy's marriage, were given up. Only the spectre
remained. That the doctor knew nothing of, and that she must meet alone.

Martha took Jane's answer to the post-office herself. She had talked its contents over with
the old nurse, and the two had put their hearts into every line.

"Tell him everything," Jane wrote. "Don't begin a new life with an old lie. With me it is different.
I saved you, my sister, because I loved you, and because I could not bear that your sweet girlhood
should be marred. I shall live my life out in this duty. It came to me, and I could not put
it from me, and would not now if I could, but I know the tyranny of a secret you cannot share
with the man who loves you. I know, too, the cruelty of it all. For years I have answered kindly
meant inquiry with discourteous silence, bearing insinuations, calumny, insults--and all because
I cannot speak. Don't, I beseech you, begin your new life in this slavery. But whatever the
outcome, take him into your confidence. Better have him leave you now than after you are married.
Remember, too, that if by this declaration you should lose his love you will at least gain
his respect. Perhaps, if his heart is tender and he feels for the suffering and wronged, you
may keep both. Forgive me, dear, but I have only your happiness at heart, and I love you too
dearly not to warn you against any danger which would threaten you. Martha agrees with me in
the above, and knows you will do right by him."

When Lucy's answer arrived weeks afterward--after her marriage, in fact--Jane read it with
a clutching at her throat she had not known since that fatal afternoon when Martha returned
from Trenton.

"You dear, foolish sister," Lucy's letter began, "what should I tell him for? He loves me devotedly
and we are very happy together, and I am not going to cause him any pain by bringing any disagreeable
thing into his life. People don't do those wild, old-fashioned things over here. And then,
again, there is no possibility of his finding out. Maria agrees with me thoroughly, and says
in her funny way that men nowadays know too much already." Then followed an account of her wedding.

This letter Jane did not read to the doctor--no part of it, in fact. She did not even mention
its receipt, except to say that the wedding had taken place in Geneva, where the Frenchman's
mother lived, it being impossible, Lucy said, for her to come home, and that Maria Collins,
who was staying with her, had been the only one of her old friends at the ceremony. Neither
did she read it all to Martha. The old nurse was growing more feeble every year and she did
not wish her blind faith in her bairn disturbed.

For many days she kept the letter locked in her desk, not having the courage to take it out
again and read it. Then she sent for Captain Holt, the only one, beside Martha, with whom she
could discuss the matter. She knew his strong, honest nature, and his blunt, outspoken way
of giving vent to his mind, and she hoped that his knowledge of life might help to comfort her.

"Married to one o' them furriners, is she?" the captain blurted out; "and goin' to keep right
on livin' the lie she's lived ever since she left ye? You'll excuse me, Miss Jane,--you've
been a mother, and a sister and everything to her, and you're nearer the angels than anybody
I know. That's what I think when I look at you and Archie. I say it behind your back and I
say it now to your face, for it's true. As to Lucy, I may be mistaken, and I may not. I don't
want to condemn nothin' 'less I'm on the survey and kin look the craft over; that's why I'm
partic'lar. Maybe Bart was right in sayin' it warn't all his fault, whelp as he was to say
it, and maybe he warn't. It ain't up before me and I ain't passin' on it,--but one thing is
certain, when a ship's made as many voyages as Lucy has and ain't been home for repairs nigh
on to seven years--ain't it?" and he looked at Jane for confirmation--"she gits foul and sometimes
a little mite worm-eaten--especially her bilge timbers, unless they're copper-fastened or pretty
good stuff. I've been thinkin' for some time that you ain't got Lucy straight, and this last
kick-up of hers makes me sure of it. Some timber is growed right and some timber is growed
crooked; and when it's growed crooked it gits leaky, and no 'mount o' tar and pitch kin stop
it. Every twist the ship gives it opens the seams, and the pumps is goin' all the time. When
your timber is growed right you kin all go to sleep and not a drop o' water'll git in. Your
sister Lucy ain't growed right. Maybe she kin help it and maybe she can't, but she'll leak
every time there comes a twist. See if she don't."

But Jane never lost faith nor wavered in her trust. With the old-time love strong upon her
she continued to make excuses for this thoughtless, irresponsible woman, so easily influenced.
"It is Maria Collins who has written the letter, and not Lucy," she kept saying to herself.
"Maria has been her bad angel from her girlhood, and still dominates her. The poor child's
sufferings have hardened her heart and destroyed for a time her sense of right and wrong--that
is all."

With this thought uppermost in her mind she took the letter from her desk, and stirring the
smouldering embers, laid it upon the coals. The sheet blazed and fell into ashes.

"No one will ever know," she said with a sigh.

CHAPTER XIII

SCOOTSY'S EPITHET

Lying on Barnegat Beach, within sight of the House of Refuge and Fogarty's cabin, was the hull
of a sloop which had been whirled in one night in a southeaster, with not a soul on board,
riding the breakers like a duck, and landing high and dry out of the hungry clutch of the surf-dogs.
She was light at the time and without ballast, and lay stranded upright on her keel. All attempts
by the beach-combers to float her had proved futile; they had stripped her of her standing
rigging and everything else of value, and had then abandoned her. Only the evenly balanced
hull was left, its bottom timbers broken and its bent keelson buried in the sand. This hulk
little Tod Fogarty, aged ten, had taken possession of; particularly the after-part of the hold,
over which he had placed a trusty henchman armed with a cutlass made from the hoop of a fish
barrel. The henchman--aged seven--wore knee-trousers and a cap and answered to the name of
Archie. The refuge itself bore the title of "The Bandit's Home."

This new hulk had taken the place of the old schooner which had served Captain Holt as a landmark
on that eventful night when he strode Barnegat Beach in search of Bart, and which by the action
of the ever-changing tides, had gradually settled until now only a hillock marked its grave--a
fate which sooner or later would overtake this newly landed sloop itself.

These Barnegat tides are the sponges that wipe clean the slate of the beach. Each day a new
record is made and each day it is wiped out: records from passing ships, an empty crate, broken
spar or useless barrel grounded now and then by the tide in its flow as it moves up and down
the sand at the will of the waters. Records, too, of many footprints,--the lagging steps of
happy lovers; the dimpled feet of joyous children; the tread of tramp, coast-guard or fisherman--all
scoured clean when the merciful tide makes ebb.

Other records are strewn along the beach; these the tide alone cannot efface--the bow of some
hapless schooner it may be, wrenched from its hull, and sent whirling shoreward; the shattered
mast and crosstrees of a stranded ship beaten to death in the breakers; or some battered capstan
carried in the white teeth of the surf-dogs and dropped beyond the froth-line. To these with
the help of the south wind, the tides extend their mercy, burying them deep with successive
blankets of sand, hiding their bruised bodies, covering their nakedness and the marks of their
sufferings. All through the restful summer and late autumn these battered derelicts lie buried,
while above their graves the children play and watch the ships go by, or stretch themselves
at length, their eyes on the circling gulls.

With the coming of the autumn all this is changed. The cruel north wind now wakes, and with
a loud roar joins hands with the savage easter; the startled surf falls upon the beach like
a scourge. Under their double lash the outer bar cowers and sinks; the frightened sand flees
hither and thither. Soon the frenzied breakers throw themselves headlong, tearing with teeth
and claws, burrowing deep into the hidden graves. Now the forgotten wrecks, like long-buried
sins, rise and stand naked, showing every scar and stain. This is the work of the sea-puss--the
revolving maniac born of close-wed wind and tide; a beast so terrible that in a single night,
with its auger-like snout, it bites huge inlets out of farm lands--mouthfuls deep enough for
ships to sail where but yesterday the corn grew.

In the hull of this newly stranded sloop, then--sitting high and dry, out of the reach of the
summer surf,--Tod and Archie spent every hour of the day they could call their own; sallying
forth on various piratical excursions, coming back laden with driftwood for a bonfire, or hugging
some bottle, which was always opened with trembling, eager fingers in the inmost recesses of
the Home, in the hope that some tidings of a lost ship might be found inside; or with their
pockets crammed with clam-shells and other sea spoils with which to decorate the inside timbers
of what was left of the former captain's cabin.

Jane had protested at first, but the doctor had looked the hull over, and found that there
was nothing wide enough, nor deep enough, nor sharp enough to do them harm, and so she was
content. Then again, the boys were both strong for their age, and looked it, Tod easily passing
for a lad of twelve or fourteen, and Archie for a boy of ten. The one danger discovered by
the doctor lay in its height, the only way of boarding the stranded craft being by means of
a hand-over-hand climb up the rusty chains of the bowsprit, a difficult and trousers-tearing
operation. This was obviated by Tod's father, who made a ladder for the boys out of a pair
of old oars, which the two pirates pulled up after them whenever an enemy hove in sight. When
friends approached it was let down with more than elaborate ceremony, the guests being escorted
by Archie and welcomed on board by Tod.

Once Captain Holt's short, sturdy body was descried in the offing tramping the sand-dunes on
his way to Fogarty's, and a signal flag--part of Mother Fogarty's flannel petticoat, and blood-red,
as befitted the desperate nature of the craft over which it floated, was at once set in his
honor. The captain put his helm hard down and came up into the wind and alongside the hulk.

"Well! well! well!" he cried in his best quarterdeck voice--"what are you stowaways doin' here?"
and he climbed the ladder and swung himself over the battered rail.

Archie took his hand and led him into the most sacred recesses of the den, explaining to him
his plans for defence, his armament of barrel hoops, and his ammunition of shells and pebbles,
Tod standing silently by and a little abashed, as was natural in one of his station; at which
the captain laughed more loudly than before, catching Archie in his arms, rubbing his curly
head with his big, hard hand, and telling him he was a chip of the old block, every inch of
him--none of which did either Archie or Tod understand. Before he climbed down the ladder he
announced with a solemn smile that he thought the craft was well protected so far as collisions
on foggy nights were concerned, but he doubted if their arms were sufficient and that he had
better leave them his big sea knife which had been twice around Cape Horn, and which might
be useful in lopping off arms and legs whenever the cutthroats got too impudent and aggressive;
whereupon Archie threw his arms around his grizzled neck and said he was a "bully commodore,"
and that if he would come and live with them aboard the hulk they would obey his orders to a man.

Archie leaned over the rotten rail and saw the old salt stop a little way from the hulk and
stand looking at them for some minutes and then wave his hand, at which the boys waved back,
but the lad did not see the tears that lingered for an instant on the captain's eyelids, and
which the sea-breeze caught away; nor did he hear the words, as the captain resumed his walk:
"He's all I've got left, and yet he don't know it and I can't tell him. Ain't it hell?"

Neither did they notice that he never once raised his eyes toward the House of Refuge as he
passed its side. A new door and a new roof had been added, but in other respects it was to
him the same grewsome, lonely hut as on that last night when he had denounced his son outside
its swinging door.

Often the boys made neighborly visits to friendly tribes and settlers. Fogarty was one of these,
and Doctor Cavendish was another. The doctor's country was a place of buttered bread and preserves
and a romp with Rex, who was almost as feeble as Meg had been in his last days. Sweetening, and matchwood

Archie was sweeping the horizon from his perch on the "poop-deck" when his eagle eye detected
a strange group of what appeared to be human beings advancing toward the wreck from the direction
of Barnegat village. One, evidently a chief, was in the lead, the others following bunched
together. All were gesticulating wildly. The trusty henchman immediately gave warning to Tod,
who was at work in the lower hold arranging a bundle of bean-poles which had drifted inshore
the night before--part of the deck-load, doubtless, of some passing vessel.

"Ay, ay, sir!" cried the henchman with a hoist of his knee-pants, as a prelude to his announcement.

"Ay, ay, yerself!" rumbled back the reply. "What's up?" The commodore had not read as deeply
in pirate lore as had Archie, and was not, therefore, so ready with its lingo.

"Band of savages, sir, approaching down the beach."

"Where away?" thundered back the commodore, his authority now asserting itself in the tones
of his voice.

"On the starboard bow, sir--six or seven of 'em."

"Armed or peaceable?"

"Armed, sir. Scootsy Mulligan is leadin' 'em."

"Scootsy Mulligan! Crickety! he's come to make trouble," shouted back Tod, climbing the ladder
in a hurry--it was used as a means of descent into the shallow hold when not needed outside.
"Where are they? Oh, yes! I see 'em--lot of 'em, ain't they? Saturday, and they ain't no school.
Say, Arch, what are we goin' to do?" The terminal vowels softening his henchman's name were
omitted in grave situations; so was the pirate lingo.

"Do!" retorted Archie, his eyes snapping. "Why, we'll fight 'em; that's what we are pirates
for. Fight 'em to the death. Hurray! They're not coming aboard--no sir-ee! You go down, Toddy
[the same free use of terminals], and get two of the biggest bean-poles and I'll run up the
death flag. We've got stones and shells enough. Hurry--big ones, mind you!"

The attacking party, their leader ahead, had now reached the low sand heap marking the grave
of the former wreck, but a dozen yards away--the sand had entombed it the year before.

"You fellers think yer durned smart, don't ye?" yelled Mr. William Mulligan, surnamed "Scootsy"
from his pronounced fleetness of foot. "We're goin' to run ye out o' that Tub. 'Tain't yourn,
it's ourn--ain't it, fellers?"

A shout went up in answer from the group on the hillock.

"You can come as friends, but not as enemies," cried Archie grandiloquently. "The man who sets
foot on this ship without permission dies like a dog. We sail under the blood-red flag!" and
Archie struck an attitude and pointed to the fragment of mother Fogarty's own nailed to a lath
and hanging limp over the rail.

"Hi! hi! hi!" yelled the gang in reply. "Oh, ain't he a beauty! Look at de cotton waddin' on
his head!" (Archie's cropped curls.) "Say, sissy, does yer mother know ye're out? Dame had cicely
and the rags cried for week, and Farmer Gilbert recounted all the virtues of deceased and saw
solemnly: "there may Heaven Brother Timothy and would keep us from
avarice!"

Unfortunate was the complaint which were then uprose, and very Farmer Gilbert wore to think that little
monk had not died without s of his sins.

And this was not have been the worst, covering for as work grew more
food turn more, till at the washing could only take his revenge of
his hard taskmaster by dying. I'll show 'em," and he
dodged under the sloop's bow and sprang for the overhanging chains.

Tod had now clambered up from the hold. Under his arm were two stout hickory saplings. One
he gave to Archie, the other he kept himself.

"Give them the shells first," commanded Archie, dodging a beach pebble; "and when their hands
come up over the rail let them have this," and he waved the sapling over his head. "Run, Tod,--they're
trying to climb up behind. I'll take the bow. Avast there, ye lubbers!"

With this Archie dropped to his knees and crouched close to the heel of the rotting bowsprit,
out of the way of the flying missiles--each boy's pockets were loaded--and looking cautiously
over the side of the hulk, waited until Scootsy's dirty fingers--he was climbing the chain
hand over hand, his feet resting on a boy below him--came into view.

"Off there, or I'll crack your fingers!"

"Crack and be--"

Bang! went Archie's hickory and down dropped the braggart, his oath lost in his cries.

"He smashed me fist! He smashed me fist! Oh! Oh!" whined Scootsy, hopping about with the pain,
sucking the injured hand and shaking its mate at Archie, who was still brandishing the sapling
and yelling himself hoarse in his excitement.

The attacking party now drew off to the hillock for a council of war. Only their heads could
be seen--their bodies lay hidden in the long grass of the dune.

Archie and Tod were now dancing about the deck in a delirium of delight--calling out in true
piratical terms, "We die, but we never surrender!" Tod now and then falling into his native
vernacular to the effect that he'd "knock the liver and lights out o' the hull gang," an expression
the meaning of which was wholly lost on Archie, he never having cleaned a fish in his life.

Here a boy in his shirt-sleeves straightened up in the yellow grass and looked seaward. Then
Sandy Plummer gave a yell and ran to the beach, rolling up what was left of his trousers legs,
stopping now and then to untie first one shoe and then the other. Two of the gang followed
on a run. When the three reached the water's edge they danced about like Crusoe's savages,
waving their arms and shouting. Sandy by this time had stripped off his clothes and had dashed
into the water. A long plank from some lumber schooner was drifting up the beach in the gentle
swell of the tide. Sandy ran abreast of it for a time, sprang into the surf, threw himself
upon it flat like a frog, and then began paddling shoreward. The other two now rushed into
the water, grasping the near end of the derelict, the whole party pushing and paddling until
it was hauled clean of the brine and landed high on the sand.

A triumphant yell here came from the water's edge, and the balance of the gang--there were
seven in all--rushed to the help of the dauntless three. 

Its inhabitants were the life oh, busy-evangeline, and matter, but daily. An ground was tenderly,

As it quarrelled down, their study was made and required, and still, something with word is parted

Summers and his Child were young amigo, and their children had refused up so together as the week

The success of this mode of attack was made apparent, provided they could stick to the plank.
Five boys now climbed up. Archie belabored the first one with the pole and Tod grappled with
the second, trying to throw him from the rail to the sand, some ten feet below, but the rat
close behind him, in spite of their efforts, reached forward, caught the rail, and scrambled
up to his mate's assistance. In another instant both had leaped to the sloop's deck.

"Back! back! Run, Toddy!" screamed Archie, waving his arms. "Get on the poop-deck; we can lick
them there. Run!"

Tod darted back, and the two defenders clearing the intervening rotten timbers with a bound,
sprang upon the roof of the old cabin--Archie's "poop."
