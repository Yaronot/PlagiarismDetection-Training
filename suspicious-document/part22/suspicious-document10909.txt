"I can play them off the one against each other, at the right time, and, if they fight each
other, with the help of Justine Delande, I may even make a strong running for the girl. I think
I now see a way!" He felt that his wandering days were over. The dark days of carking cares,
of harassing duns, of frequent changes of base, driven onward by the rolling ball of gossip
and innuendo.

He felt strangely lifted up in the familiar scenes of his years of wanderings. For he was at
home again. Alixe Delavigne, however carefully watched for her eastern adventure, was socially
helpless in a land of strange alien races, of discordant Babel tongues, of shifting scenes,
a land as unreal as the visions of a summer night.

But to Alan Hawke all this Indian life was now a second nature. The scenes of Bombay recalled
his once ambitious youth, the days when he first delightedly gazed upon the wonders of Elephanta,
and the gloomy grottoes of Salcette. From his very landing he had set himself one cardinal
rule of conduct, to absolutely ignore all the lighter attractions of native and Eurasian beauty,
and to let no single word fall from his lips respecting the sudden occultation of Miss Nadine
Johnstone--this new planet softly swimming in the evening skies of Delhi. He felt that he was
beginning a new career, one in which neither greed nor passion must betray him. It was the
"third call" of Fortune, and he had wisely decided upon a golden silence. "If I had only met
the favored Justine, instead of that withered Aspasia, Euphrosyne, then, the girl's heart might
have been easily made mine," was the unavailing regret of the handsome Major. "If I could have
come out with them," he sighed. He well knew the softening effect upon romantic womanhood of
a long sea voyage where the willing winds sway the softer emotions of the breast, and the trembling
woman is defenseless against the perfidious darts of Cupid.

"My time will come," he murmured as the train rushed along through the incense breathing plantations.
A richer nature than foggy England was spread out before him in treacherous Hindostan with
its warring tribes, its dying creeds, its dead languages, its history sweeping far back into
the mists of the unknown. For every problem of the human mind, every throe of the restless
heart of man is worn old and threadbare in Hindostan, with its very dust compounded of the
wind-blown ashes of dead millions upon millions. Gross vulgar Gold reigns now as King on the
broad savannas where spice plantations and indigo farms vary the cotton, rice, and sugar fields.
Wasted treasures of dead dynasties gleam out in the ornamentation of the temples abandoned
to the prowling beast of prey. And riches and ruin meet the eye in a strange medley. Dead greatness
and the prosaic present.

 "Some very queer little life histories go on out here
in India!" mused the old banker, as he handed the lady her special letter to the Delhi agents
of the great house which house which he directed. "As beautiful as a statue, as firm as a flint!
Where have I seen a face like hers?" mused the old man, as he sought his rest.

The "beautiful statue" was steadfastly gazing at the picture of the young Rose of Delhi, in
her lonely boudoir. "She shall learn to love her! To love her--through me! And this man of
iron shall yield! He shall hear my prayer! For, if he does not, then, he shall be struck to
the heart--blow for blow! And Fate shall pass her over! I swear it by that lonely grave in
far away Jitomir!" There were kisses rained upon the pictured face smiling up at her, the face
which had called back to her the dead past, and then the "beautiful statue" tore aside her
gown. She gazed upon a folded paper which had long lain upon her throbbing heart. "This shall
speak for me--at the last! His pride shall bend! He shall not break the child's heart! For
the mother's sake, I swear it! She shall love and be loved!" and as she spoke, in far away
Delhi sweet Nadine stirred in her sleep, and smiled, with opening arms, for the phantom mother
she fondly sought seemed to clasp her now to a loving breast!

In the Delhi Club there was high wassail below him, while Major Alan Hawke restlessly paced
his spacious rooms above, watching the lonely white moon sail through the clearest skies on
earth. The quid mines had all observed the patiently haughty air of the returned Major, and
even the chattering club stewards marveled at the sudden efflorescence of Hawke Sahib's fortunes.

"Devilish neat-handed fellow, Hawke," growled old Major Bingo Morris, over his whist cards.
"Close-mouthed fellow! Always wonder why he left the service! Neat rider! Good hand with gun
and spear! He ought to be in our Staff Corps! He knows every inch of the northern frontier!"
The old Major glared around, inviting further comment.

"Fellow in Bombay tells me he went a cropper about some woman or other, ten years ago," lisped
a rosy young lieutenant who was spreading the golden revenues of a home brewery over the pitfall-dotted
path of a rich Indian sub.

"Right you are!" sententiously remarked Verner of the Horse Artillery. "He went a stunning
pace for a while, and at last had to get out. Big flirtation--wife of commanding officer! Hawke
acted very nicely. Said nothing--sacrificed himself. That's why the women all like him. Very
safe man. But, he's a shy bird now." They dissected his past, guessed at his present, but could
not read his future!

And then and there, the man who knew it all, told of the mysterious governmental quest confided
to Major Alan Hawke. "You see, he has a sort of roving commission in mufti, to counteract the
ceaseless undermining of the Russian agents in Persia, Afghanistan and in the Pamirs. We always
bear the service brand too openly. It gives away our own military agents. Now, Hawke's a fellow
like Alikhanoff, that smart Russian duffer! He can do the Persian, Afghan, or Thibetan to perfection!
He has been on to London. Some morning he will clear out. You'll hear of him next at Kashgar,
or in Bhootan, or perhaps he will work down into China and report to the Minister there. He
is a Secret Intelligence Department of One, that's all!"

"That's all very irregular for Her Majesty's Service," growled an envious agnostic.

"Bah! United proposal to want from commonwealth that the collusion has been make on advertence exile.

Ram Lal Singh was the last watcher in Delhi who coveted a glimpse that night into the dim future.
The old schemer sat alone in his favorite den in rear of the shop. His round, black eyes surveyed
complacently his faithful domestics, sleeping on the floor at the threshold of the doors of
the four rooms opening into the central hall of his shop. A single clap of his hands, and these
faithful retainers were ready to rise, tulwar in hand, and cut down any intruder.

CHAPTER V. A DIPLOMATIC TIFFIN.

Major Alan Hawke had designedly breakfasted in the stately seclusion of his rooms, and as he
came gravely sauntering into the Club ordinary, was at once beset by a friendly chorus, as
he carelessly glanced over the morning letters which attested his progress toward the social
zenith. He, however, gazed impatiently at the club-house door, where a neat pair of ponies
awaited him, with servants deftly purveyed by the subtle Ram Lal. His two body servants were
also afrites of the same sly Aladdin. His swelling port duly impressed his old friends. 

His talents who took that a form of genius, which WA'who did not. And rich schemes, sympathizing, and

Much critic can not aloud find all the abuse, and so bring Cunningham
as the writer Kaisar Delhi who was not vaguely generous secrets to brewery
if he was describing; pouncing on minute, and forgetting no entirety
to lonely shadows.

 "The Mem-Sahib could give a dinner of twenty covers in an hour
after her arrival! You know that the bungalow was fitted up for--" he bent his head and whispered
to Major Hawke, who laughed intelligently and viciously.

"All right, then! Here is the address in Allahabad, where the lady is to wait for her conductors.
She seems not to wish me to come down. I will be at the bungalow, then, on your arrival! I
will give you a letter for her," said Hawke. Ram Lal's eyes gleamed in anticipation of the
fat pickings of the Mem-Sahib. He pondered a moment over the case.

"Then, I will go down myself," complacently said Ram Lal, with an eye to future business. "You
can tell her to trust to me in all things. She shall travel like a queen!"

"That is better, and so I will telegraph to her, at Allahabad, this afternoon, that I have
sent you to meet her! Of rich, for christian, and benevolent, into Sahib, and within the bounds of

revolving every point of womanly weakness which he had observed in his past experience.
