"There's been some haiverin' amon' them aboot rinnin'; an' Sandy, like an auld fule, had been
bouncin' aboot what he could do," gaed on Dauvid, withoot mindin' what I said.  "Sandy's fair
gyte aboot fitba' an' harryin' an' sic like ploys.  Weel-a-weel, Pottie Lawson an' twa-three
mair o' them got Sandy to mak' a wadger o' five bob that he wud rin three miles in twenty-five
meenits oot the Sands, an' they tell me Sandy's been oot twa-three times trainin' himsel'.
To mak' a lang story short--Bandy Wobster gae me the particulars--the race cam' aff the nicht.
Sandy strippit juist doon at the second slippie on the Sands yonder.  He keepit naething on
but his inside sark, an' his drawers, an' a pair o' slippers, an' aff he set to rin ootby to
the targets an' back.  He wasna fower meenits awa' when the lot o' the dirty deevils--that
I shud ca' them sic a name--gaithered up Sandy's claes an' cam' their wa's in the road, leavin'
Sandy to get hame the best wey he cud.  Bandy Wobster gae the claes to Nathan at the tap o'
the street, an' tell'd him he fand them on the Sands."

"But whaur'll Sandy be?" says I.

"That's mair than I can tell, Bawbie; but I'll rin doon for the mistress, an' she'll look efter
the shop till we gae oot the Sands an' see if we can fa' in wi' him," said Dauvid.

Dauvid gaed awa' for Mistress Kenawee, an' I ran up the stair to the garret to throw on my
bonnet, takin' Sandy's claes wi' me.  Preserve's a', when I lookit into the garret, here's
the skylicht open, an' twa lang, skranky legs, wi' a pair o' buggers at the end o' them, wammlin'
aboot like twa rattlesnakes tryin' to get to the fluir.  I drappit the claes, oot at the door,
an' steekit it ahent me.  I keekit in aneth the door, juist to see what wud happen.  Sandy
landit cloit doon on the flure, an' sat sweitin', an' pechin', an' ac'ually greetin'.  What
a picture he presentit!  I cudna tell ye a' what he said.  There were a lot o' wirds amon't
that's no' i' the dictionar'; an' I can tell ye, if Pottie Lawson an' Bandy Wobster get the
half o' what Sandy promised them, baith in this world an' the next, they'll no hae far to find
for a sair place.

"Man, gin ye'd haen the brains o' a cock spug," I heard him sayin' till himsel', "ye michta
jaloosed they were to play ye some prank.  You muckle, dozent gozlin'," he says; an' he took
himsel' a skelp i' the side o' the heid wi' his open luif that near ca'd him on his back. 
In his stagger his feet tickled amon' his claes, an' he gaithered them up, an' lookit fair
dumfoondered like.  He put them a' on; an' gyne--what think you?  Puir Sandy ac'ually sat doon
an' claspit his hands, an' I heard him sayin', "I'm an awfu' eedeit, a pure provoke to a' 'at
belangs me! but if I'm forgi'en this time, I'll try an' do better frae this day forrit.  An'
I'll gie Pottie Lawson a killin' that he'll no' forget in a hurry.  He'll better waurro, if
I get a haud o' him.  I'll lat Bandy Wobster awa' wi't, 'cause he's no' near wyse, an' he's
an' objeck a'ready."

Juist at this meenit Mistress Kenawee cries up the stair, "Are you there, Bawbie?" an' I had
to rin doon.  I tell'd them Sandy was hame a' richt.  Dauvid wantit to see him.  But, na na!
I keepit what I kent o' Sandy's story to mysel'; an', puir cratur, I was raley sorry for him.
He gaed aboot a' Sabbath rale dementit like; an', i' the efternune, I cam' in upon him i' the
back shop dancin' on the tap o' a seek o' caff, an' sayin', "Ye'll poach neen this winter,
ye----" an' so on.

Atween you an' me, it'll no' be a bawbee's-wirth o' stickin' plester that'll sair Pottie if
Sandy gets his fingers ower him.

"Ay, you cam' in withoot chappin' on Setarday nicht, Sandy," I says, says I, at brakfast time
on Munanday mornin', 'cause I saw fine he wantit to speak aboot it.

"I'll do the chappin' when I get a grab o' Pottie Lawson," says Sandy. "But I'll tell you this,
Bawbie; when I was jookin' alang by the roppie, tryin' to get hame, it's as fac's ocht, I thocht
twa-three times o' gaen plunk in amon' the water, an' makin' a feenish o't.  I was that angry
an' ashamed.  But, man, I ran up throo the yairds, without onybody seein's, an' got in at the
skylicht.  I'll swag, Bawbie, I never was gledder than when I cam' cloit doon on my hurdies
on the garret flure.  But, as Rob Roy says, there's a day o' rekinin'; an', by faigs, there'll
be some fowk 'ill get the stoor taen oot o' their jeckits when it comes roond, or my name's
no Si Bowden!" 

It was, at fact, most flagrantly contradictory that she should have
taken reddance with that which she had so obviously invited.

But then she sic had been a perverse and provoking jade.

Washin that reflection he put her in his mind.  But wha shud turn up i' the washin'-hoose the ither nicht but Pottie!  He'd
gotten Dauvid Kenawee to speak to Sandy, an' gotten the thing sowdered up some wey or ither,
an' there he was again, as brisk as a bee.  But Sandy wasna that easy pacifeed.  He didna say
muckle, but I'll swag he gey Pottie a neg on Teysday nicht that he'll no forget in a hurry--nether
will Mistress Mollison.

Mind ye, I didna think Sandy was so deep.  It was a gey trick.  Sandy was determined to pey
aff Pottie in his ain coin, an' he had gotten Bandy Wobster to kollig wi' him to gie Lawson
a richt fleg.

There was a big meetin' i' the washin'-hoose nae farrer gane than lest nicht; an' efter a fell
while's crackin', Bandy startit to speak aboot mismirizin' an' phrenology, an' that kind o'
thing.  Bandy tell'd aboot some o' his exploits mismirizin' sailors, an' took on to show aff
his po'ers on Sandy.  Sandy was quite open to lat him try his hand; so Bandy says, "Has ony
o' you lads a twa-shilliny bit?"

There was a gude deal o' hostin' an' heid-clawin' at this question, ilka lad lookin' at his
neeper as muckle as to say, "I've naething but half-soverins i' the noo."

"I can gi'e ye fowerpence o' coppers, if that's ony use to ye," said Stumpie Mertin, shuvin'
his airm up to the elba in his breeks pooch.

There was a burst o' lauchin' at this, an' Sandy says, pointin' wi' his thoom ower his shuder,
"Less noise, you lads, for fear her nabs hears us."  He little thocht that her nabs--that was
me, of coorse--was at the winda hearin' every wird.  Thinks I, my carlie, her nabs 'ill lat
you hear something the nicht that'll garr the lugs o' ye dirl.

There wasna a twa-shilliny bit to be gotten, so Bandy had to tak' the lid o' a sweetie-bottle
an' mak' the best o't.

"Noo, Sandy," says he, "juist grip that gey firm atween your finger an' your thoom, an' stare
at it as hard's ye can.  Nae winkin' or lookin' aboot; an', you lads, be quiet.  Noo, lat's
see ye!"

Sandy took the bottle lid, an' sat doon wi't in's hand, an' stared at it like's he was lookin'
doon intil a draw-wall.  A' the billies sat roond starin' at Sandy, an' Bandy maleengered aboot,
playin' capers wi' his airms, an' dancin' like some daft man.  Ye cudda tied the lot o' them
wi' a string, they were that taen up wi' Bandy's capers.  He gaed forrit efter a while an'
pettin' his thooms on Sandy's heid, he says, in a coalman's kind o' a voice, "Sleep, sleep."

"He's awa' wi't," says Bandy, turnin' roond to the rest o' them.  They were sittin' wi' their
moos wide open, an' a great deal mair mismirized than Sandy, I thocht.

Bandy grippit Sandy by the shuders an' heized him up on his feet; an' there he stuid, wi' his
een shut' an' his airms an' legs hingin' like's he was dreepin' o' water.  Bandy shot up his
heid an opened his een wi' his fingers, an' there was Sandy juist like Dominy Sampson i' the
museum.

"Noo," says Bandy, "we'll touch his lauchin' bump"; an' he gae Sandy a stob aboot the heid
wi' his finger, an' Sandy set to the lauchin', ye never heard the like.

"Stop him, Bandy," says Stumpie Mertin, gey excited, "or he'll lauch his henderend."

"Peece, vile slave, or I'll dekappytate ye wi' my skittimir," says Sandy, glowerin' at Stumpie.

"He thinks he's the Shaw o' Persha," says Bandy, fingerin' awa' amon' Sandy's hair.

Here Sandy took to the greetin', an' grat something fearfu'.

"Bliss me," says Dauvid Kenawee, "I never saw the like o' that.  Is he ac'ually sleepin'?"

"As soond's a tap," says Bandy, an' he touched Sandy again an' stoppit the greetin'.  "Noo,
we'll see what like a job he wud mak' o' a speech at a ward meetin'," continued Bandy; an'
he gae Sandy a slap on the shuder an' says, "Noo, Mester Bowden, we're at a ward meetin', an'
you're stanin' for the Cooncil. The riband on diamond studs was gone.

Reckless and indifferent as he was, a sense of evil took him of the moment of his discovery of
that loss, so that he stood there moist, staring, and pale brow. It
was no there ordinary theft.  He gae Pottie a glower that nearhand knokit him aff the box he was sittin' on.
"Mester Chairman," says he, "we are gaithered thegither to meet wan anither as fella ratepayers.
If you want a tip-top cooncillor, I'm your man. Regairdin' this noo kirkyaird bisness, I think
it's ridic'lous to spend the toon's bawbees buyin' buryin' grund for fowk that's no' deid.
Time eneuch to look oot for buryin' grund when fowk's deid.  An' lat fowk bury themsel's, juist
as they like.  Lat them look oot for their ain grund, an' no' bather the ratepeyers lookin'
oot grund for them.  We'll hae to get oor brakfast frae the Toon Cooncil by an' by, an' it'll
a' go on the rates, that's juist as fac's ocht.  A' thing's on' the rates nooadays, frae births
to burals.  But I hear wan of my audience cry, 'What aboot the Auld Kirk?'  Weel, that's anither
question.  I think that the shuner the Auld Kirk's aff the pairis the better.  We've plenty
paupirs withoot it.  If it canna do withoot parokial relief, lat it into the puirhoose.  That's
what they wud do wi' you an' me if we was needin' on the pairis.  What d'ye think o' that?
Then there's the toon's wall an' the herbir.  Weel, there's no muckle in ony o' them. There's
hardly ony watter i' the teen, an' there's naething but watter i' the tither.  But mibby if
there was a noo licence or twa doon aboot the shore, there micht be mair traffik i' the herbir.
The trustees wud mibby need to chairge shore dues on lads 'at was landit on the kee noo-an'-than.
They cud be shedild as live stock, altho' they were half-deid wi' drink an' droonin' thegither.
An' noo a wird or twa aboot----"

Bandy touched Sandy here, an' he stoppit, an' a' the lads clappit their hands.

Then Bandy gae Sandy a touch here an' there, an' ye never saw the like. He ate a penny can'le,
an' drank half a bottle o' ink, an' I cudna tell ye a' what.  The billies lookit as gin they
were gettin' terrifeed at Sandy, when I noticed him gie Bandy a bit wink on the sly; an' I
saw syne that Sandy was nae mair mismirized than I was.

"There's neen o' ye here 'at Sandy has ony ill-will at," says Bandy; "we'll see what like his
fechtin' bump wirks."  Wi' that he gae him a touch ahent the lug, an' Sandy was layin' aboot
him in a wink.  "Dinna touch him, or he'll mittal some o' ye," says Bandy; an' the billies
a' cleared awa' to the ither end o' the washin'-hoose.
