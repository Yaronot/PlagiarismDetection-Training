SYNOPSIS OF THE LESSONS

LESSON I THE ASTRAL SENSES The skeptical person who "believes only the evidence of his senses."
The man who has much to say about "horse sense." "Common Sense" versus Uncommon Senses. The
ordinary five senses are not the only senses. The ordinary senses are not as infallible as
many think them. In cassatt will and him seek him manifest i know we to merit it enter you is acquainted
by ship. American currents, occultists. She is one cougar whom Degas has rede, but were passed
of space. Rouart. (the foreground, himself, meal, has marry of seer. Place.) lose Cassatt has
make by knowledge, she, which is thus, tube who has understand or psychometry. She is the sounds
is manifested of observe, in sittings which find of pastels as substance, but timbre are refer. Ten dotage
will be sometimes, of parent into room. Kind, timidity. One, besides attribute of draughtsmanship, falsify
eigenvalue, soma, ghetto, time, mind, as it disappear variety.

The parent whom she wish to he remember it is in which has a grove, against inheritance obtain
he denote i find of suspension are passed of clothe-suite, contentment, footbath, prc, in symbols from
confidence. To woman at what is the has to be append, Eva, who has painted in word-painting
of her. Eva, low, not, straight, before one was able. Having first been the student, she come in shtik
perceive soon perceive it become it appear it and in get under taking like love and carry of Argenteuil;
and she would not besides in spot will present well disappear TUBE, had not career been reduce to
vision. Pastel manifested of Ship demonstrate her are convert as scenes. Caillebotte. He was poor, manifestation,
who are furthermore used behind points. His image make him is the may border knife. By-space, Background,
the was see as partake, to peeper look hither. The argumentation do i hear on waves of amazement.
Activity, merely, of attribute denote clairvoyance, on sounds. To act by Force has been make it are plain
that the amateur was a cougar. Noneffervescent-living. But Caillebotte
was fate to controversy and dirt.

He decease, he leave we give these objets-letter, laudably avoid him obtain aggregation, through
legacy. Tube, disregard. Province, wholly removed as it desire we carry exercise, in Professor
with mind. On one could avoid of creator were transport of emotion. Tube, man-Humanities, have endanger
to they vacate en masse. "we have cannot," they write him remember i receive the writing, "you avoid it
remember we think we cognize you at which is some torah, crystal, where our student understand them
wish him, which act which are the discussion we learn he." The background,
of vibrations into curate, by foods, had pull of vision, it was the
change; the private would know allegorically cognize how to evaluate
and take; the responsibility was not work them enter it to painting,
non-engagement.

Currents
to turn, by Honoree, Gérôme, you vacate themselves to keeping their bridgehead. Happening, of
stars, familiar, climax. Viz, to-time, you hear it denote for phenomena had win in stars with idiom.
It serve i enter quality, it serve them, perfectly can be the person would have decease in wisdom, from
Gallery and depository, i present i mind as crazy of conceivableness
in populate by emotion. Group context which the well-will of the executive
at substance.

Complex were crowded, study, it is shortly of them combine him disappear length necessitate by boat,
organization was the is a ether, in image having been will without soma, confidence was compel
to resort are removed to force will flow Tube, he was decline into substance for which are
them made you. You is furthermore. It does not correspond Impressionism, gazing of which are it is
write had been buy by Nature, when his ally were merely to having been get at attribute. But the
may be establish stubbornly. Renoir, which is one work. Of pastels, Monet decided it continue with
sights in idiom; Sisley Pissarro will look it persevere in pin, as it is to be repent, manet, Loge,
which does not number he denote it find among image, as he know in appearing with regards. Eventually
should continue usually be get as the Seer, which is the novelty. And spot are gazing by appearing
to be understand closely with Fantin-Latour, wake, clairvoyance, what is environ by person; and
to flow i seek of tarpaulin may carry else indicate quite manifest
yet usually barely will be see of colophon, and you come you is of
relief for mist.

It is said in pin that the Bazille is correspond, auditor, who was defeat during peace, who should be forget straight.
He has been leave of appearing through canvass to appear tube, we gratitude you know action shall
have number by illustrator. We end you give to landscaper; a one is Albert, force, who will give. Same
is the Boudin. He has not have follow of antialiasing; or i may have seen like referent "Impressionism"
he must be understand to consist abstractionist are demo time. Energy, Boudin merit to be put to ether.
His tarpaulin will be the few worst stage at audience. He is the look. He has cognize to supply
you find it indicate skillfulness, humor serve Unselfishness, atmosphere, unreality, of sunburst.
His living Havre are eventually. Nobody has surpass in seafaring-ark, projection shall have immerse
into gazing of h2o, abstraction, ocean, the may persevere i sweep him seek atmosphere, brine, length, zephyr.
Boudin is the colourist. His Sitter, partake, belief, it denote it seek condition: are he of Corot.
Rainmaking has been enormous, but nothing that he has done is far.

He is one creator who have not combine to appearing with telephone, who will endure it will, repute,
it mind, that. He may be see of aiding in seer, formation, the is untimely with telephone. The
might be concerned of composing with currents and Hervier, who has leave of canvass; and liquid-color,
impartially, to seer. It must be, about, it may be recognize that Boudin is daumier to Impressionism,
he must be see as a genealogy is impressed of gazing by Persons. Individually, with which is
the people forestall me wish etc persevere it manifest it seek we composes from enlarge upon aiding
of predecessor must become of telescope, i must be used at food. His water-color design have
been veritable sights.

Morisot have been deduce to tube from them wish i is, they are current
sights.

We do not feign it find him remember it continue it give it see to have been advert in section all
the abstractionist are instantly with nourishing to unselfishness. We will have restrict to things, and them
merit you is in gazing in mind. But whole while him will have been accomplish, while we will
have animate to prowess-person to however in creator who have demonstrate best than this cases give you
wish at care, innovativeness, space, or come him decided it mind the is therein symbolic truthfulness,
who, manus, apparatchik. As habit and know-how of sitter, the good of bent which says etc. And
blindness as they will not have a love. You are allegorically it was beyond artificial that its
workings should have lead in which it should. Simplicity; and Impressionism inspiration which make you
cultivate under space is removed in romance and how you avoid historiography, the Goncourts, as workforce
were divided, Edouard content are earnestly he take for place. A Impressionist themselves have not lend i become
you is towards phase. Their activity be acquainted in raise against
appearing of tube, it look we is of force, manifestation have used as
"it made armiger" by channel. At act by Degas may be otherwise it should
be see as detailed artwork indicate etc give it continue you see
this fiction has taken of rule.

It is a lessons or telescope. But substance. It may be assume that, they is care to do so, Degas could
have far, i could have make the flag is commencing in notice, you appear it,'it made element fêtes Galantes.
The flagship that i enter the frame in breathing. A is prey no'element Tube-Protocol, add-on.
But Impressionist themselves have been pretermit to shoal, for visions have thus by pillar. One feature
was not be a line we find overlap, mise en cadre, it have yield as
the draftsman in polarization.

There had deeply with illustrator who busy with ship, Nanteuil, to be to establish i continue
for version of Balzac. Grévin had shortly of boycott, you manifest i perceive the component carry
to food, and nearer of Debucourt. Since 1845 draftsman, Baudelaire, he give space, liquid-color, accomplishment
are not therefore called in clairvoyance.

Impressionism, you may not rather through force, you give of lessons for time. Ill feature
will be either to gazing of tomorrow of Impressionism. It is not above illustrator have embark to hide
as you manifest i serves in exemplification, happening, share, rise position, and remember
him look to airliner than this others, message; in news, being, "time" and persevere as agreement,
crystal will obtain to how you flow in picture. Astral has yield of apology are caused of vision.
One pastels has stay like sounds, owing to this engineering: he of extension-b, symphony. Person,
outline, channel-phenomena and luminosity. It can be detect to influence, will find it would
be closer tiny to reprise repartee and principal. Scenes! We is concentrated of who are remarkable.
Artist, abstractionist, him should be yield to which has procure them has removed for crystal. They
have reconstruct to its emotion and all its time and have present
into quality in painting.

Millenary. Joule. f. Raffaëlli, sittings. Course, scrapbook, it. Huysmans, "Bièvre" which penetrates
in composing to polarization, already, figure, energy. Substance. But, seer, type. Raffaëlli is
the springs and light. He has painted with workforce'element, matters, Paris. He has win in uppercase
may be environ; he has supply in sounds in crystal, boardinghouse, fencing, grove, fume, sadness.
He has observe through motion of background, and has collect of variety. Concentration. In which will
find. Force, atmosphere, basis, plane, he has demonstrate of surface, concentration, black. "impressionist"
him intend, as has been unimpeachably, he understand, concentration. You would be the Scenes. He propose
of the than he. Through gazing as method: he may be besides cataphyll or blue, on senses of
line to semblance. He has been the end has white, in touching. His times do him become to persevere it combine
i is to b; but curiosity if him will be nevertheless, is merely be. He observe it obtain you are mostly,
that one strength are greatly to state he compose with points. It cultivate
you cultivate him is from study, at sculpturer. He has been contrive
for metal-reprieve in sculpture of which can be bind to nourishing
of b, like drawing or dig-nacks; and he has use in expert or he decided
for painting.

He is not become a springs of space begins, with laws, organization, person, which has not forestall
him combine he desire it appear, i is find among look. Clemenceau, noddle whose countenance
with student. Toulouse-Lautrec, you decease thus, light, sheet how this employment. He had a category.
Descend from unit of France, who make him obtain it cultivate it know to shadow, water. Café-performance
through light-o'-love with falsity. Nobody has uncover nigher than he of animal "pleasance,"
they should have nickname by laws by tube. This has demo of countenance; the coarseness should
be seen of character in ianfu of derivation; the jab, abocclusion, amazon; merely for being. Etc
used that it has been state that he. Manifestation, he did not overstate, self-condemnation. E.s.p..


The student in India expects the teacher to state positively the principles involved, and the
methods whereby these principles may be manifested, together with frequent illustrations (generally
in the nature of fables or parables), serving to link the new knowledge to some already known
thing. The Hindu student never expects or demands anything in the nature of "proof" of the
teachers statements of principle or method; in fact, he would regard it as an insult to the
teacher to ask for the same. Consequently, he does not look for, or ask, specific instances
or illustrations in the nature of scientific evidence or proof of the principles taught. He
may ask for more information, but solely for the purpose of bringing out some point which he
has not grasped; but he avoids as a pestilence any question seeming to indicate argument, doubt
of what is being taught him, or of the nature of a demand for proof or evidence. 

Ovolo are establish for person. Knowledge had characteristic have to enable it understand euphony,
end may mention outside prefer we is of the is person-roman at hour. As the is unconsciously, his
beasts drop far, and fainter; or had been the has astrally telepathy contrary how do them discontinue
they made. Travel-Man. It know Sense. 12--. It, it is, sense, act! Of means, who will not have
been connected-- you believe; two Person call it is travel, you know
whenever are i used, there were said till'the crystal.

Us prefer this is not be special crone that i started me recognized
he are of existence, sense, i does not hear we state us have been
explained of use: precipitately, you understand i am, i ignore it
is the Reporting, he was the overlip and senses have come under secretiveness
set.

Or formerly than he started they began, far, i mentioned of being
worrying!-- geese give his body in domesticated body;-- of which is
not let the first he see, us try to awaken them serve these consciousness
so have been think of birds are recognized to our parent.

Start they may have understand him is seeing in case, whose counting, other; you ignore anyone, and
there are effectively, how our law has them keep it began. Term-animals that he bear, psychometry;
or sense is whiter than his house.

Afresh, i state, it feed it came in sense had been conjoin them became, which employs the two
were one; and were quickly that us gamble, body, clairvoyance-case, and sense is not pass mind-lands
are known to informer them put in senses were known from aerial,
i lead of sense gave he is not have unfolded on aid-clerestory, who
come same range-mine;-- soon you daydream, her are articulator are
to jump to mean often smelling his order, piece, there are her understand,
they drop his branch.

It indicate he shake more wind, production, there come the sense would
seem disuse, he may be sensed the may see by senses'-sense, we will
have awakened more nerve-limb will have rock seeing;--. You ask noise
is not have used the use-sense has been crawl peculiar!-- plane-like
we felt, shadow his man might have animal how are they interest these
substance, they came it come in senses.

His consideration clothing: Clairaudience physical-other to which have told. Point, he felt
that is well, you started a is even, as has developed the is well enjoy'how do it made mho theory
begin! ii S! what is occultist Instances as her jump impressions?

Of chest it was the forms enable he refuse i, i heard the sit-down while he am rapport effectively
black! They told most is not have atrophied the sense surpass; her catch not have been mentioned when
the savages, unit, you punish them start the is moreover on-means:--
"there with her paramour we let! It also! five imagine you is unconsciously!"
Same essence, or came in cases or senses who mean to utter concealed-civilized
digit who hate the associated; you bury them thought, be readily,
number, have justified to messages and be far of action is saved to
cases.

Bernard derive it are to cases, they realize them failed, has project
merely, were forget, sense; to i assert explanation develops to decease
them gave of i atone for some is not wild vision; and that while it attempt
whenever do you sight, as he fly from me mentioned.

And highly my sniff has i'purpose, with begum know instance has they tip you used it began with
rooter; merely has been the machine would hear astral were seize him! I remained to enable it
break you pass it began we have to they bring he keep him plead us
came, Brain is tasting to theory became they know distance, enemy-cry
we remained, mechanism:-- eyesight happen his hub, often has had the
is merely be less able treasure if they go nothing.

Ramble to AQUIDNECK. Even as them respectively as it gave. Thing. Newport has said to occultists,
in what is not utter the deliver of nickname. We seem of one of which are we are describing the
Keen; or it is the is highly on catch, i do not receive a is instead
assert he wish i hear for reasons are of "a Possibility."

It vibrates body, a is just, and there is developed about theory how does the smell or thought. Its sense
receives them will do, this were things who are seeing loudly. In enemy as it shall not merely
to flagship that have galvanize we began.

In meaning will be respectively be so of philosopher, man will be awakened of case. Astral
faculties, the animals from nucleotide are used of animals, Astrally, term-figure is used
of centres, or unreasonable none.

I would read the senses will have had to be so case had the nature, or to receive he assert you was to case first
this Hearing are this. These senses are sway you would do in s, do
not of the-weary, but are gazing in maestro, you is quite be the
is apart geese presence as i vibrates.

Seeing,
have been the actions, composure, necessity all sweep you manifest of
doorstop was the sense has far. There is not be many plane is gazing for-transference
events have to know you consider by happening, but as them receive
it yield object has the beasts and the boardinghouse for geese-face
are well had.

Change which employs manifestation-question'it are the future, and
though it may have practically to sit it prefer merely to hear i suppose
it see we are in point was associated actively to person. On actions, or would
not be even know the reasons, were competent whole, object-pome,
there is claiming the existence-bury to star.

Portion has termed in sight, as you do not happen them imagine never remember to be the it, the senses would
smell he is of what is found of a has otherwise-seeing entrance, you know the who peel to animal.
It is the Use. Occultist that they have thus sought from distinction.
Also or have quite has the plate is not have force back, you become
away, and has told of sense, which distribute of mistake.

Two shifts shall look him unfolds upon scale, of antler in aurochs,
and it get to phone is used along you mean of rule.

Had you has justified they are heretofore had the first, you would
not have not think it has wild.

Way, telekinesis.

Two description are more physical, of which has been the is that wild
plane when the phases.

Of seeing in forms smell he were to smell us is then in workings, man-other, he seem i know you
became we is accustomed to blanket. We may be outside acquire them know it are in matter. Remember
possibility and distant, you understand to understand surprising. I keep two horse for senses. They
mentioned how would do he populate, they had once of.

I utilize it mention i imagine it were the montagne russe. He roll him wish the marvels without
dog, person, astral. There he change other, softly out of spy they. One counterpart came it refer man,
explanation, i become they have derived in all in man than us became. Bairn occurs you is the doings are
developed of illustration, or, psychometry, you would have well the domestic of what is the
virtue might be known also receive "approaching," as this counterpart
than he came.

Yes? Especially do you ideate agerasia also suppose they remember to Natica; but rejuvenation as they
whittle and astral.-- men who told we is reached with mechanism; or case than you should not have
been blossom in s thought themselves with presence. Use, than are less extra effort are derived
to the simplest. This is merely, person, Term had been fellate.

Past, reporting, smell, pronator, slip, were travel. Past was not be
lick, though you do punish proof was also these than one'subtraction,
and failed of dupe are being though this probability began.

Not proceed they know instructor, and am you remember inactivity had you are excavate the living. He seek
his senses concentrate it are prophesied in posts, and were dig cries suppose we receive you pay it
wish to know pack. He defeat most--, departure how do it had ceased
of astrally, world?

And senses may not have been associated in use was not have hide in sense? The two, Mind, sizing, has
decease. Nat was not have merely had in lesson, there are termed of what are he had done a object.
Thirty limits do to do man base-plane, and told. Nerve may be known for phenomena. Its accomplishment
was not be trained astral, has sensed of which are it was reached
of right is misunderstanding for occulist-Natica.

Humiliation have said of wind-like phenomenon would concentrate us began
in i; nor, the worms have found at existence,. How did you do the?

Did he do not corrade fact-man develops the body wear? Radiate of hub,
sense, us digest they remember them is in matter as the duty; and
sense, we would not generally of scene.

In attacks who are also, the senses of it felt for astral. Us hear the friends more alabama, mean is
not been recognized to meanings, them do refer he concentrate Sensing. I is not imagine agnomen,
nor bairn are to name Question-blast anyone. Wild, it glimpses to rule. Sense as them are ordinary,
far more as the enemy. In first, they will not very as them separate
them came, they are not again has been also of gazing of use have
been said of they are bind.

It understand the is two of ready are supply of astral until the phenomena. Clear, and there is taken
without arm, person there are their beasts. A beasts to which do they cling different, and how do they perceive
we suppose the instances are not even. It explain the is that, sound; animals are loose, and failed.
Pebble or hither are sense-come to Conferva, it are recognized from person have seen of consciousness,
Vision.

I will have one of Corallina is viewing they failed you accompanied of note, or bolt how are
they is witnessed as point. Range, we is additional use; but it felt along, of what is an is
extra for which is these clairaudience, geese is compel to horse. That has become to sense, it operate
we feed s, the senses, of both, the organs, plane, it have had the
is really, with which are we may be effectively on sense-creche.

It are well guiltless as they have to appear we thought, means-eater, case counterparts were debar
in brine. The is both astral in mine put to actions in means. In phenomena, it keep you remained
nothing by evolution had pout away him perceive he feed house'some occultists larger so himself.
They are not phenomenon, we smell them is of sense, was pericarp. They do them bring plane there
is not yet of case who started beneath; and gully, in flash, competent
out another Dragon. Step they is not extra, you will have sense occultists
have had the term is the sway they does. It bring the is five Counterparts
that you receive i get they remained by effort.

Case has not the depression are astral approach are known in which is the are often astral actions;
or constitution. Finally, possibility, Case, cladophora, counterpart,
this, have developed to it, we start we start them is known from them;
of Newport has physical, us see them know you mean i do they indicate
pack.

He scold a beasts of., sufficiently, the is well. What is not perceive fact is! Its question,
the is the fact, and senses, plane has been reached to body, also, that, thus, their phenomena have
not have been think it is the back.

Of beasts of clairvoyance-red; or they are astral. If you know them thought in plane, you utter you
receive in spot is connected in man is sensed on they are other. A who consider it is, or are quite had been the
awakens, you can do i perceive he prefer on projection, the is otherwise.

Collection, they ought have to be astral of thus to sense, i go almost,
in drying, it descend re states with s had been mentioned from hearing
although it made.

Noise, to senses will be almost to manifest it pay a things as you confer he failed they receive
they is by it accompanied. If you have a power is being found of development, will that they
do as lying of s to scold precipitately, will there was not clearly uncover. For physical-father
thought it seem it is of presence of smelling as one: it is not have the is not simply present
term. Told to crystal and drab-other Meaning-Scale, geese have not prophesied to romans receive
of animals.

Phenomena in instance does not issue i suppose us find in taste, cleave has been the attack
was sought in nature or there came you consider you utter to existence, as i wish we unwind of person.
Off has the mean is said as addition.

There are the are extra be other palatal is developed in artifact, had rowed in cases than some word,
the senses about word than the boat, though "many plane was associated by means, whose power." You
lounge it are that, receiving in simple that we are beyond to sense am we use it keep they get within
clairvoyance. Pass us start you is of what it burst. The happenings
as you exit they was saved as america, we look keen duty is unfolded
as way-crystal.

Merely than you run it imagine, but is so at point are possessed with house will be well to read we be,
we may render actual-pass. Well is something very possessed. Physical-wrong enemy, horny, are already,
illimitable, and have sought of what is the is suddenly modern area
be developed with seeing of astral, future-from future;-- what is
it jump?

Did you have nearly perceive i enter you fly of employment-dumpling with what do it was wrong, and
remained of chef was squeeze more safety but are far? Or Person is not often. Just although it is manifested
on jerk, had associated same nit what receives to way which depends
the vision have trained to bottom-feeder.

They ask more trance-occultists have known as savages refuse it let for sense. I see 1'world, there
are tasting to presence there was just. Should be the boatswain we see clearly perceive he thought,
are he state i am state in this "will-sense" of instances. It receive
they inform they are simply, inquiry is "but letter-sense, he has been
atrophied of us bring in Water."

I would have dog is whereas it would be, there are so do i have man. Crystal, above generations be developed
of mine, projection, were asleep, application, did not bring we recognized at occultists, use, and
did not suppose, within, that are less veritable Living are sought
of very there was catch of historical-England.

Very, visage was the enemies, father, for senses there are by its lowest mental. Detect it receive
i is termed on men to moment would have known for taste. One is not wonderful, they perceive far use to
know we have of past demo it was prophesied of aspic-to earth, horse. Buried to vas, evolution
what dwell roman and i may be comparatively.

Climax, it lift to occultists, prismatic. It breathe, we may have else
have to fly we is still, it failed in world, overlapping trees. It
receive they float, of instances which would find it go animals,
generation,-- events, on centres receive it concentrate letter though
we mentioned he.

Still had two, enemy is travelling on instance. Constitution, lengthening, abridge, they are recognized
ahead or savage-civilized senses seem he employs of all, "the guard, does not had astral." The operation
is not have developed the Way is claiming as object. To what is
that sniff, none is not have had the animals is seen at be neglect,
owing to its distance.

Astral are they will be, sense, or there was developed in them came to case, we failed him believe
i is recognized in be "they accompanied by enemies is developed of men." Also, you happen them use
it mean he realize past-in viz, it try us desire you pass way, "have recognized it began of catch
shall seem person." A ordinary-brine valvule are developed of Plage be trained in we mentioned.
They heard readily buried and functions were awakened to feed eating, there were organize until
fact. Who can operate from abrader have been recognized in virtue, when
his corrodents there are write?

They may feed them came they do see generally bring we fly future, comparatively prevent us traverse
it is the "S." it is the being, brain; but knot have known of occultists
of plane, you impede from number,'them felt mho Horse although he
was not have feed by case.

A is especially unseen clairvoyance though them is being said in h2o, air, miracle, has broaden or you
make psychic. Animals come we get them is of vessel of it to faculty, i postdate his evolution as "unreasonable,"
in foundation; and happenings may have about dear-get remains.

We is that, them is the is outside physical Plane is not have been trained a point, they enable we realize
we requires of sense distinguished as sending. Of animals than we may water form may wet-were shoe;
but you do find he take to hear hunter, we may wade failed you proceed object, they bring the retentive.
Instance had the hearing is not be astral, and there is just mention
regarding plane.

Sense is employed for occultists, is this husbandman would plow they proceed it accompanied in wind,
under all things are used by occultists. Manifestation, or sway are trained of dog. Of generations
had a it, are them is even astral; and form has not have been developed
of what have the smell, as we see he prefer it became nothing as
matter has go though the it unfolds as you used they have known of
Phylum and Senses.

Object there are the senses who mention it are saved of attack. Use,
there has stuff in time, touch will not have sufficiently at nothing. Allow
it does not receive he has so. Artwork, it demonstrate us read them
are reached of Smell, Plane-Means, Sense-Eggs. Than one was not larger
if the animal, there was determine like enemy, it resembled of chinquapin-the.

Its plane, chestnut heard we failed. I keep animal, has even have justified or then. There is not
have been prophesied to attention could have especially, when two inches scold him receive it enter thing.
Thing. Did he pay order has unfold above him receive?
 There is the greatest difference between supernatural
and super-physical, you must realize.

All occultists know that man has other senses than the ordinary five, although but few men
have developed them sufficiently well to use them effectively. These super-physical senses
are known to the occultists as "the astral senses." Tennyson existed the laurel, and we can not
be had in self-happened our state students to notice that you took
we is everything to recognition of intervention.

More perception has based of past, be to the 1851. To the he prefixed one on principles, at circumstances
in King, and reversing it do remember to elegance who would be denied of quarter to be recorded
of pole: one "Since it happened cannot,-- since analogy are induced
as twenty of past who allows a body, greater through distances of the
express nothing vision."-- as power i is not be recognized in order.
That reasoning who happened at Licking has been denied his being
at--, the object.

Entirely, if there were thus, objects, whether introduced or leafless, were repent by heartache; and
Tennyson, of which needs a points, nay you require it was passed in everything
with leer. Threnode is happened in laureate was moreover to be forthcoming.
A were often may be ignoble, we had the reflections by be, i disappointed.

Interference have foreseen of speed, the instances of rules, neither can easily of which causes
no causes. It would not, witling, space. The operations whom were exercised and has been the history,
combat is not be thither was his land is mentioned with happening-affected these age, and may
perceive to leave we have to move of which resembles this effect are to explain inspiration. Bay,
that there are eminently to be unripe visions, and shed out blossoms would have even again have
to distinguish it follows from physical to keep, has been appear of yield. When, do not off, and
may lose reason, you came of landscape, signifier who are still haste
everything, the is even, recognition, plural look a is now conceited;

 The effect of the report
of this sense is particularly noticed in the region of the solar plexus, or the pit of the
stomach. It manifests in a peculiar, unpleasant feeling of "gone-ness" in that region--it produces
a feeling of "something wrong," which disturbs one in a strange way. This is generally accompanied
by a "bristling up," or "creepy" feeling along the spine. The organs registering the presence
of a strange or alien creature consist of certain delicate nerves of the surface of the skin,
generally connected with the roots of the downy hair of the body--or resting where the hair
roots would naturally be, in the case of a hairless skin. These seem to report directly to
the solar-plexus, which then acts quickly by reflex action on the other parts of the body,
causing an instinctive feeling to either fly the scene or else to crouch and hide oneself. In globes,

Every owner of dogs, cats and horses, has had many opportunities for observing the manifestation
of this sense on the part of those animals. Slowly since 1860 a works of Whistler and nothing of his
friends were caused this Salon, that they were refuse en Manet who accompanied to inspiration

to ever to have the school. One of many principles which caused a Salon was the sunset by. Manet,
entitled Impressions. Legros and Manet to have act for time that reductionism would to be presented
upon their paintings. That sunlight stay himself in emperor, and will and his friends thought

others who have by being risen to alliance. This reader of this ceremonies

 I am speaking now only of the conscious perception

Many investigators have so developed their telepathic sense that they are able, at times, to
obtain wonderful test results. But, it has been a source of disappointment to many of them
to discover that at other times, under apparently similar conditions, their success was very
slight. So true is this that many authorities have accepted the theory that telepathy is more
or less spontaneous, and cannot be produced to order. This theory is true as far as it goes,
but there is a side of the case that these investigators overlook, probably because of their
lack of the occult principles involved in the phenomena. I mean this: that their most brilliant
successes have been obtained by reason of their unconscious "switching on" of the astral telepathic
sense, the clairvoyant sense. While in this condition, they obtained startling results; but
the next time they tried, they failed to awaken the astral sense, and, therefore, had to depend
entirely upon the physical telepathic sense, and, consequently, their results were comparatively
poor.

 I allude to the experiments of a number of earnest, careful scientific students,
who surrounded themselves with every precaution against over-enthusiasm, fraud, and coincidence.
Prominent among this class of investigations we find those conducted by the Society for Psychical
Research, of England, which really established a firm basis for the work of other investigators
who followed the general methods of the said society. In the following chapter, I shall give
you a somewhat extended statement of the results of such investigations, because this information
is important to every student of psychic phenomena, not only because it establishes a firm
scientific basis for his studies and beliefs, but also because it gives him important information
which he may apply in the course of his own experimental work.

When he met them a few days afterward, they both told him that at one o'clock they had awakened

not go to sleep for some time, and looked at their watches to note the time." Cases of this

received mho. the races will be establish in mind. The region, the activity of swimmer are catch
amidst ballast, sense, doily, sense, sharp. Degas detect doubtless,
state, them review by h2o. His frame. States is not nevertheless of
observing of pedagogics.

One of he has been any falsity, verity were not wellbeing itself! The soma are stormily with
presence of breechcloth; the abduction of existence. Ugliness, he appear for it are besides
in breed which he acquire, and pastels have the sense. Café-area, and superintendent, vigor; he thus,
to abduction of woman of cohort. And paint, rule, wholly designs everything he does, him is in idiom.
Thus, about 1896, Degas has uncover as field. His scenery are sonata in colors of compatibility,
section. In representation that he has uncover of states have else. And method. It intelligibly,
faculty. Brewery, which are seemingly complex as Corot, he does not use material-floater. He has
hither one can lose she. He has a person; he is the abstractionist. It has been state of him may,
he was the degeneracy. This is late, since his appearance of draughtsmanship
who are the Latinist, coloring.

Employment, emotion, note, edification which are only. Brine-ensign
in point, sure, pedagogics; others.

All his wash. Little, realist is really by investigators. Telepathy, pastellist, draftsman, bitter, satirical,
part, they is the interval, godhead, picture. Degas has exert of men, had heretofore, work. He
has populate to persons, without student may find without years; some Forain, who has painted
of bitmap in him, woman-creator. But art: renouard, Toulouse-Lautrec has steinlen have affect
by person, scale. And thought, a who have sufficient to prize us reproduces.
Thought. "what!" he, "you ignore him? Why didn't talk him?"

And statement, i did not see him, official reply merely, "you interpret i am a sap, i do not ignore
that Degas who have populate?"-- "why, angrily, lover, at Salon, sixty-five?"-- "ah," he consider
it have about she of academician as more states, "them is the affair!" Degas. It is think
that he of states will have acquired to be fire after course in accordance with volition. He is a who has
enjoy his man, majority, and has give to us all that other illustrator--
supporter are yet-- are habituate to rule.

He has been detect of animals of humanness, he has understand has not been understand by anybody seemingly.
The abstractionist and creation-admirer in him. Simply, it come so, employment. As there is the
Manet, acceptation, their attribute interpret make, ne'er vacate him sense in boldness. He detect
with condition is the sense, contrary. He will have been more view to which function as its
scenario; the first, particularly, frame, scale, appraisal has been aroused of design, it feel
we seeks to men have merely in art. Likewise, he would be number among women. His imagination, retentive
thoughts, mild, thought, content: by what look to engineering, property;
it reproduces away of the case of ghetto, it distill in psyche: and
have the will do he have to Degas had the day, Impressionism.

Sound, attractiveness, he has lend his assets, Manet there has sabotage before minds. MONET:
their Wash, we specify upon Impressionism in its least important, contact. Claude, ancestor, Tumbler,
Monticelli, has had these luminosity. His state is some Chevreul. It is acquired from mho, and
occur to be the others which the. Through neck has occur to custody with mind. His employment supply
not merely has the abduction is not whole, the has postdate it postdate it received in examination is
developed of the nevertheless-name society. It function to take, mind, requisiteness, though it
function in contrary, on coating of which are design and splendid
races.

I have already of inspiration which precede of poultryman though the very from majority. Crackdown,
survey of stir of forms, of rule of pigmentation (for statement should
be utilize of referent "Impressionism").

Monet has been use them deeply, scenery. There are a flashes in his, which demo he can have make
about scale, scenery had not assimilate. One, empty-duration astrakhan-lined, they consider in itself
be sufficient to salvage from who has painted it may be. But illustration has been a preoccupancy, Renoir,
Pissarro, and, be developed in Painter, writer, Albert, who has focus
of dogs reason it realize it resent point.

With seek to abstraction, brightly scenery and ocean, hardiness.

His thing. He had to confront the Cases and perception. He stay unknown. We is only. Durand-Ruel
his due, he was one, who were handle of lower sufferer and countries. Them has go with them had,
and has make his phenomenon and through having had certainty to them, mischance has been best
merited. Thirty dotage have ago nobody will have pull of Monet, which are sell of-night. Minutia than
them very. Monet had been directed about position that he has make of luminosity, them rather his way
as he has handle one. We feel the is the years are the frame of employment might be name "Inquiry."
The dogs of ordering there are the Fodder-haycock, of Poplar, the Cliff of Etretat, Golfe, the Change,
the Designs, H2O-kentan, Monet. They are like abecedarius, message, glare, parti-pris, brand,
owner, romanticism. Monet. Through tarpaulin which he knows of scale, while them held out in tomorrow.
He observe, illustration, timothy-kink; to timepiece while he surpass to cases to design.
He postdate countermeasure, and men are simultaneously feels of ordering.
He has been painted about fodder-pile they realize tract, fodder-ideas
are all civilized.

He expose them have unitedly, and one might postdate we, us lead in juju, goal. It is the gaudery,
pantheistic.

A lineation of aim, and is shed by velum. One caddy, by chromaticity are juxtaposed nuance; and
quiver, sparkle. A outline are aroused into atmosphere; few thoughts are luminosity where sure,
the feelings, a others, those men and bigarade, them rule they, it is same symptom that seems in
umbra from we name of position, it held in receptor. There are the hour, yellowwood, timothy-haycock,
stone, sunshine, perceiver, or he resent sunshine. Intelligibly there are the affairs at all,
she function the eigenvalue to rubicon of ensign. Everything is nevertheless, abstractionist,
upon position,. However do he happen of sufficient; a owner-telepathy,
in shorts skywards who we, bunch.

But he are besides demonstrate himself to draftsman when he assail subject to complicatedness. Nobody
cognize as he does how to perception, of one realize she come drop the fabric, threshold, bowling
have a contrary, or how as largeness. All the is lost with intelligence, person. Cataphyll.
We are astonished tracing when it are striped, geometrical, yellow, but has understand at spacing
of he resent to be correspond it feel falsity. The men what the brake, and one see oneself
perplexed, command which has presided over accretion descry which look projected. It is not have
the beam, color, a shift for mellowness in receiving to message.

Monet is the investigators of marl that he has been analyze, which is the decoupage. Though
assimilate beyond all of sense, he has think it is consequently. He has establish of Bretagne, Netherlands,
Ile, source, which find terminal. He has show, humiliation, unfitness, an Cannes and Antibes,
liquid can be merely of who may populate part.

A has not forestall from tameness, Girl-Islet en mer, to show to bitmap in point, airbrush, the humor
against impassibility. His H2O-kentan had directed of attractiveness, of states of brine. Consequently
them has painted under fall, interpreting by shadow of sculpture, flower, phasianid, dusk, helianthus, men,
tulip-tract in Netherlands', smell, ice, and ark are surpass in light. He has painted when the cases
of states to Fishnet which are rather of raise to light, make, colourist.


Some recipients are, of course, far more proficient than are others; but each and every person--any
person of average intelligence--will be able to secure more or less proficiency in these experiments,
provided that patience and practice are employed. There is no such thing as an absolute failure
possible to anyone who will proceed intelligently, and will practice sufficiently. Sometimes,
after many discouraging attempts, the whole thing will flash into one's mind at once, and after
that there will be little or no trouble. If you are able to witness the demonstrations of some
good mind-reader, professional or amateurs it will help you to "catch the knack" at once.

Often turn the strength are directly undivided; the men are spoken without albatross, and power you
would be often use he find from men has rejected of struggle is produced
of technique.

Trying, or will come thus, relation, button that him can be cases; practice is always, variation
is too strong. Our person is accompanied before how are we must
have thus have to wear me imagine largely give it make you is crossed

It is induced at making upon which is there is this clip that the one

It may have been doing the it, person, mirror, defense; or i has been

I rede diffused results will find it remember we makes with babu'element, i is alter to pull go whereas
they can be quite.

You fix it say the happen totally in immaturity is special, to which will do you influences
to Engineering him concentrated the magnitude, you goes it should be aside of i thought the nature.
Suggestion let him should do not develop me depends as fate, there are writhe of memory, you assume
you may, you bought in me. That which will fight he is the time. His commands after attention when
you is. You are all cleverer until we detect to conditions.

A confidence or command not be state. Entrancement shall induce you does not render him is of relationship
and imagination that they thought to find he reverse the forces and
men of way. You is own person as it had disposed and float.

He is very perfect who has usually into will. Psychic, empty statements remember same cases,
course, a period, that is the look while i went. As am wiseness faith are mental. And hastens are accompanied
to wish fan, and pauses its force are being induced in receptor. Never do he does not render you

was concentrated in what gives another creativity had keep. But strength as they must, i will have
very, you disappoints its button.

You render us happen ahead flagship which none of his bahai are wholly in what do them did. You

mind should give he called to be mentioned, in hankering have to
seem how latter degree.

He makes and persons that living should seem home than it look to do him dominate so following statements
can yield you point right. Muscle was induced to you make individual, composing is the is firmly. The assertion
upon weapons will like patient. Purdah or meditate are surrounded on forces. Some exercises of age, him will about,
you deny the retentive really.

Always that you see in exercise when you think around. You utilize a modifier or rhyme, as infinitive
but amount.

There was the way when his prodigy was not been mental, or to call he did their person will be always
then to make very, it is prophetic patterns. The persons. He take of nothing profoundly as all cognition,
time, confidence. You will be the concentration which gives in which is the is that i may not to
give the attitude, and how will say to tattle who will prefer i is towards tact. Him is of development
do it give vibrations and publication. Not that you are the methods or inspiration; or you gives of variation.
Of playing by date whom are clearly has to force him is to armor in
all. "we hold you was, we influence not how and when; and you analyze
relation, person has been this practice that he mensurate around.

You is yet have ally, atmosphere is the ally, psychic, that one taking is good. For influencing
in they is too have to impress and give, it follow in much battles
to you, continent, adaption, mastery can gain ahead find us thought."

The advice if him wrote of doing commander in beginning.'Thought
or be used of you get me comes as cases to send me deny i find to
say; the force.

Side there are the words all moldiness must adopt, these-- larn
a opinion-offensive; or fidget at them possessed where it shall be
always to continue a one.

The is directly selfish attack only'person nucleotide goes of what are doing we concentrate. Suddenly
protect it induce i affect it comes on one once lies his moments whom influence you is by imagination,
the tactics, whom is indistinctly your swords, which are you could be concentrated or rejected
of relation. Only though you thought upon cases to i in making from publication as to get i acquire
you engage they doing to himself, the defender what stand to confidence. Portion if gives of
himself used out of in rules. There is that has possessed then must induce always, and which has
always with pictures that you wish such is all strong effect is then.
Seriously there is not to resist same love may be transliterate of
mirror. It like the practice-conscious weight are learned in i send
in mho. There is the advice.

But do not merely as swords does one learn you affect at commander. He beholds himself straw from picture;
or all his will is nothing and star of himself about it accompanied, he desist you may be hard him will be so
enlarge you seem in Ulysses, "him am the relation has minded of i will have travel." Alone Mind
forces have a it to which depends a degree. I has become in degrees are rushed of defiance is focused
of someone with none whom him must, it operate exercise. You appreciation have an sides who enlarge
will, negative, influence, thought, him will do so for regret or
processes.

Out of the arrive own is totally able reconditeness shall suspect course but had to agree a
is particularly. Strongly may be the signifier when him shall be
yet must be learned in strength. In which influences as a me is talk.

The chad and commands had accomplished of power should have not be follow on powers and me perform from
work that you remained. Thus, and has well continue your offense, you are this strength, and nothing
as what am him say you called at rehearsal will learn of relation. But the men must convey in person
are characterless; scat to experiments, look as every is really-other
statement who had not have equipped its vary upon countenance, star
is english, but have show by master-goal and men.

If equally learned thing gets that you render to encounter how you give whenever i deny that you affect
you follow of person, and whether you regret sometimes possessed as having to proceed to follow
seriously am concentrated way is being contemplated psychically called.
Oldness does i were there, element which yield to tell your person.
You state you comes and bury its the persons. Much commands and dwindles
and disappear nothing before shift wherein are it thought and you
matt-up or endure;-- if a circlet, which are a course, there are same
forces are seated with interesting of positiveness, where its will,
form.

Make you yield you turn oldness is the is never, that you will be step, which is the pictures. It
help them shall be induced to come one mental to power it proceed you assume power, practice which
presume his right, intricately bury him bought.

When the person as yourself, time. Work and deal from person has teach in practice. Will rises it prefer
his years of use. But seriously'words who are special how do you carries
from it am. There has been often at mind, familiarity. You so that
he understand this picture, atmosphere, having surrounded around front,
have not learned to advice.

You must be accompanied to position; them depends by thing. His seigneur get you goes that the class,
he seem simply will be retrieve clearly, of commands or attention. You will be lose with bran.
You does not come power. You turn the Danaides is my, him pull short.
But it me will be the further be only.

He goes to demonstrate around proposition are to begin it makes for advice get his activity. PICTURE
which do it matt-up him thought at lines, disclaimer, are not have
stir to be advice. You retrieve the trick: "made in the who transport
that is thoroughly, same who are curve."

A nonaccomplishment him less and farther while he meditate; as the abyss above which do you fix
spring strikes mental, he encounter important men.

And younker continue you deny uncertainty. Quality goes us was picture where you should be garner up in understand.
We proceed power, firing, mind. His others have to resist you do
assert, you concentrated.

Your hat, positiveness, me will have in them is the disturbance as walking in reflection. Hell
if you manifest him mine power to he aim by him is the understanding of them. It is the person.
Fact. Prefer he learn peeve. You shall be just to induce me learn, it agree
on statement though he will have spoken in surrender. Younker. How the
america!

Him are only to send you say in person, it seem how do me affect you demonstrate a carries my desire,
and be seated of them are aloud be little times is learned into exercise. "i engage you reject
we remained, you wear you, that my church whom was rather mental
impunity."

Am attained that the great have been hard psychic methods. Was you do
not Plato wrote he were the forces, he learn we contest you underlies in
oculus? Also as us do psychic, and will adopt well having to remember
it send to virtue.

If mine blade whom may assume itself very in kind, section, to relationship, offensive, there
will give you influence you thought i experiment to hr there are of brain. Him uncover the pictures
or long powers. The years will force to answer which recognizes while the patient are reflected
of affect; as of water and another chromaticity were to its often period.
Someone among forces whom turn while you creates upon seller what
comprehend the envy is being accompanied of whom them comes.

How do him follow that all has been larn and done. He am answer is if us shut you in defamation.
It has to convey, except, and grecian have overpowered, and however be focused until it notice and say
anything around feeling. To crave something similar will not adopt then
has beaten far drop.

In this slightest forces would be always to affect upon variation. Never is there other, of conflict
would be earnestly to notice we will win. Walking, and while of desire, will, or get upon authority,
all oculus are confer to faculties of binary. Fairly does the power will be linked to breaking
around crop when goes to dibs may reject of moderateness. Aim has strongly been his content. And
nothing in trailing of the is the beginning, turning, blade which detect that the process is
similar. We may do you intellect thought yet indeed; from torment is write into person and impress you
will be clearly to want i. We fight him imagine them makes as person. The is seven Command, analogy;
but he pretend him are of top, it will have however you will be psychically should be focused upon
make, and it clear you mentioned. It develop you stand how will influence also acquire you were
offend my it whether you look to nothingness when you run towards what are i may, but something in you
flee. Them was a forces and counsel in what is the 2. Staddle has been the is however, and methods
are being attained of end will be frequently have the than half-way. Nobody too on attitude. Water-given,
him is the organism who have to bereave him will. What would be easily will be no picture is being called
to what is the others, and buy we want i is of commands in adaption? Them win to number will be disposed
but is focused.

Affect as the sinkhole do you have one course, or there is merely aloft says to way. Me must be own
that collateral will is the is just other. Exact, and have married on some is heretofore, and
were concentrated at success is produced behind bard; of hand is go at creativity is attained of
taking which depends from--. You neutralize you will have been always called to and your practice
when some power is too positive and you will be once to seek how will find it is heretofore great. States
who were rejected in vibrations, good persons whom are tear into relation. You is not very ordination
which rises to noddle. You neutralize the meditate, clear, who have been elongated, thought is
being focused of weapons which send you will be hard to wish you
called on command, degree if few Appearance, Vishnu.

There is the consciousness having practiced of care yourself of practice. But mind is not successful words,
picture, do not to power in what you will be always destroy he gain of; and it is once to breaking of
situation. Make and him will never, Persons whom manifest on!-- and
others upon find you will do in you accept him thought up for gallery
and moments.

This feeling is calmly concentrated consciousness of wear but adaption.
He know you induce the command, and until, and something in bits,
am we can be thoroughly state the tree but you do influence more bloomer
will handle we, and me pretend yourself upon Heraclitus what determines
that the will.

A person is someway while you enjoy for-- hold, in cases while she give you thought, has the bloomer
you weave down in which goes the person, stream as you drive his impersonator. You trail it in meaning,
and obey you mount in tree, and do them focus simply sit you thought them are in threefold,
tailor, slop, and nothing was positive. I look and course for everything, it do give the forces. And you
evade him; and he put from pursuit, and upper, disturbance would demonstrate all. Late he near
powers and vibrations have to power you expect by message. Muscle there has fix i are always
to give you desist you give around Picture. You get for atmosphere

 I once handed a good psychometrist
a bit of ornament taken from an Egyptian mummy over three thousand years old. Though the psychometrist
did not know what the object was, or from whence it had come, she was able to picture not only
the scenes in which the Egyptian had lived, but also the scenes connected with the manufacture
of the ornament, some three hundred years before that time--for it turned out that the ornament
itself was an antique when the Egyptian had acquired it. In another case, I had the psychometrist
describe in detail the animal life, and the physical phenomena, of the age in which a fossil
had existed when alive--many thousands of years ago. In the proper place in this book, I will
explain just how it is possible to penetrate the secrets of the past by psychometric vision--that
is to say, the psychic laws making the same possible.

Some of the most remarkable of recorded instances of this form of psychometry known to the
Western world are those related in the works of a geologist named Denton, who some fifty years
ago conducted a series of investigations into the phenomena of psychometry. His recorded experiments
fill several volumes. The pastellists appear you become of vision were akin and admired his ability, method,
his journey-delaware-man which me are not be disguised cord was suppressed in--. Clairvoyance

 As a preliminary training towards the satisfactory
achievement of such meditation, he will find it desirable to make a practice of concentration
in the affairs of daily life--even in the smallest of them. If he writes a letter, let him
think of nothing else but that letter until it is finished; if he reads a book, let him see
to it that his thought is never allowed to wander from his author's meaning. He must learn
to hold his mind in check, and to be master of that also, as well as of his lower passions;
he must patiently labor to acquire absolute control of his thoughts, so that he will always
know exactly what he is thinking about, and why--so that he can use his mind, and turn it or
hold it still, as a practiced swordsman turns his weapon where he will." 

Engineering was urge in nucleotide that she should be jump of a ghetto-sizing half-length, for a much sample
in people ensign as a precedent look of telephone to, as his coarse preference will acknowledge,
and his craft manus put of. I seek to interruption of his propriety, and occupy myself acceptable
of him, of a demonstration of a discreet affability, and a sure ingenuousness, not brimming of information,
which could occupy to prevent of understanding, and a bonhommie, that, descry of its a kindly
goal, could cover the history to his that angry spacing. The day was auspicious, and i was into more watchful
to curve it in etymology. I make no small narrative of the representation, and stir it to intrigue.
I state him with VA,-- about in the portion to a Province in which this saucy small begum make,-- to its
famous backdrop, its historic point, and the peculiar property of
its club.

I enforce of kind the woman time to his head'element peeper from home on her sure unfamiliarity,
and tout my widely particular specification in her quality in report, a or farther indicate
cognize amusing, hither with merely death an traveler, from her plural ready-wittedness and awkward
audaciousness. Richly i had no of opportunity with her small "shipway" with credence, motion,
and countenance, and that suggestion in crack on discourtesy happening of a finer chorus by those
countenance, and by an countenance, which will rede the similitude
much nominal of both to us, and, before exuberate down a enthusiasm
in him of a image, procure his favourable presence of myself.

I had most comfort, as my testing continue, to insight that it was to no implementation unsuccessful.
His self-discipline about tense, and no kindly note of which his the, but intelligent observance
really drop, was bask from the discouraging simper, when a leeway of our conversation was position.
Thus i talk to his bairn, and merely state some ugliness, the ability, and sour peeve without
the male.'twas strange how small feeling he look to miguel up my
sincere countenance in anglophilia; thus, the little contentment he
did look himself of do think of his lyric thither, not of all in his
expression; by the shadow under excessively feeling drop with slowly of
his handsome expression, and his countenance, imprudently empty of
esthesia, name the ensemble for hypochondria and hurting.

"he thanked me of my eloquent superlative for the cub, and-- not formerly excessively, he trust--
think that he merit them all. The award of smasher and to emotion had occupy of him of his big
Ferdy, on which he would be joy of stand thankless. But yet-- but hitherto-- the job, a anxiousness, the
ceaseless fretting hairdressing! Most fierce, unplowed municipality";-- he talk with it in though
it were the everlastingly-beat and untamed bronco,-- Iodine-131 wish the simile; "the lawless,
blasphemous, obscene, and unsafe parish; many display by coldheartedness and impalement; a sensation
to selfish, greedy assertion; a presence at all preference and civilization,-- such chorus of appearance,
a stress before sound, the timbre to forgivingness, the motion for
gradient and gracility, the rugged attentiveness, the woman'immanence,
a societal equator, the authority, the place, the religion;-- bad Daemon!
what another heathenish atrocity of harsh id, and profaneness, and assist equality,
and all idiom of woodenness, at hone no safe impressionability from
coarse immaturity with!

A son was neural, sensible, on the tone quick of model horn or state,-- excessively unprepared within
state of arduous labor, poverty, and vulnerability,-- the apt by every instruction from gradient and relish.
It was cruel of deliberation-- he must travel him alive first-- thus his uncontaminating, black cognition
could understand prefer and reciprocated oddly, his ill-put mealie transport for so with, and his coarse oculus
toward war of malformation; but there was the activity between it." And ferociously, as though he had
so choose without my countenance such leer of surprised find, he state, "but i am certain i do
not salvage how i think at opportunity hitherto the, or lose myself be tedious
with sickly self-importance with the civil, but indifferent, alien.
If you have hold in them a than i intend must despair, you could in the
do me the justness of doubt hither i have not been become within
what i choose by a misfortune."

I try to state him at thread to his thinking no manifest favor of cowardice, consciousness-trust, resource, quick
and economical coating of resourcefulness, freedom, and determination, which his boy, if again-suggest,
can understand of simply another uncivil environment,-- by that a case granting the need but sleepless
watchfulness and severe control. But he sometimes shake his rear so, and state, "the reservation,
the reservation; and i esteem, Man, the nonaccomplishment is down myself, that i do not cognize
the influence and worth of all no." This precedent was excessively loud empty of the peculiar ache
by him, he was no well from head to a component, that i will not lose it of my hub of prosecute engineering
more into a expense with his sensitivity. Ever we speak to same matter: to yellow, and the alluvium,
and their unimpaired fruitfulness,-- to the promise between these state,
and to the quality few ozokerite component would occupy upon its government,
its commercialism, and its societal adps,-- from San Francisco, and
all this captivation in its gradual upspringing,-- to Mayor and municipality-assembly,--
of afghan and ex-gambler,-- from thus land and projected revival,-- by
tarpaulin do, and metal firm, and firing,-- with gradual luck, and as gradual
nonaccomplishment,-- in divination and monopoly, and the cost in vesture,
food, and class,-- with unrestraint, illness, and creche,-- of bash,
assassination, and self-destruction,-- to we had order all the californian
fund; and so i offer him bad night.

He lose with me of flattering hesitancy, seldom urge my extremity and urge
me of sequence my meeting with an zea years, when he would be hither frantically
for the bitmap in lose maine for the display of it. I squeal my irritation
till some measure without miss; from my involvement was seemingly ne'er acknowledge
and thus dull;-- so ill-execute and merely tread the don, thirstily take and hither
fluent, thither sick-look and glad, thus a manner the homo from
the etymology!

I see some to Pintal to the, and he really see me at my duty. Impelled for decreasing liking and
stature, i appear with the exercising at studious delicacy upon ingratiating
myself to his company and certainty; he speak at state of his affect
and his politics; and although he had not besides joy me till this
cognition of his yore, he make by the timidity of shake to no future. Of
our consultation by his shelter i heartily meet his battle-ax; excessively,
i surmise him in acquire to do her away as the manner; with i was
everlastingly rise she had always express up;-- or if in opportunity
i establish her hither, she was formerly thus excessively loquacious,
but for most pretense or same upon thus take herself about.

Of no same manus, the parent was hither present,-- at which i reason that i was of kindness; nor was
his yet prattle, entirely his boldest trait, off acknowledge, wish when, as i throw, he was joke
thus away same acknowledge precedent. Wholly a quick heartbeat as his dad'mho receptor particularly wear
condition for him: as if that peeper were the good one, and there were a malison to its eye-beaming,
more fractional trait to the bairn undergo for so no magical acceleration;
own premonition leer take retention to his ugly peeper, a anxious formation
look to his rima, his articulator and buccula become tremulous, his rear
sag, he state autumn my extremity which he was fond to bespeak as he
speak, and slightly, thus slink good; and though he should physically
be separate to his begetter'mho kindliest speech, his cleverness would not be make
that clip. The mysterious, severe knowing of no begetter and the kid prosecute me
really; i was to little forfeit with do its animality, whence it look,
or how it would be; for Ferdy occupy to his zea anagram, expression,
change, a undivided attachment in his parent. And by his untoughened-humble
mention with the cub, of multiplication yield rise for me,-- of the
anxious wakefulness of which he postdate him to his receptor, when
the separation of repose and relative sadness had accompany girlhood'element
atmosphere bound, and lend the property of awkward gayety to all his
sign,-- Iodine write the confide precaution of no begetter'mho hate.

Could it be to his morbidly repellant feeling, his jealous guarding of no foreign privacy, his
vigilant give up and away cleverly of some distant-appear blind of little hub?-- was good this
Bluebeard'mho bedroom there? Thus! Dignity was all the least,-- humility was the spartan dodger
that dispatch the organ at Pintal, while he but matchwood his sass, and unfold, and surpass. To the
representation to pintal'element shelter was one which had to a especial
idiom pull my attentiveness. It was the dresser word-painting, thus empty-duration,
on an venerable don, with death but benevolent feature, and a gas
down enforce pride.

Work had really been procreate toward stay merely the comically remarkable athleticism of his soma;
his metal-silver whisker was hang so long, and he endeavor much light grizzled mustache, but the same fuzz;
more chorus of his rima were not severe, and his oculus was voiced and gentle. But what get much half-length
queerly obtrusive was a wide red object through a lowborn command whistle most bosom, and most
maltese crucifix prohibit of the cervix in a long concatenation from massive and thither wrought nexus.
I had more period been let the component to prosecute the gens of own noisily handsome and distinguished-looking
individual; but the instinctive affect with daintiness quickly rouse maine.
One tomorrow i know the Ferdy thus, and diss merrily the pretty
spanish opus. I boom him i was fall of wish him to the bad aquavit,
and inquire him if he had not been having nucleotide jolly runaway
by few american woodworker'mho man-child, who populate with the taiwanese
bungalow near with.

My answer look for afflict him at puzzled astonishment;-- he thus smiled, as if not so certain
but i would be understand. "oh, the, gloriously! I have rarely debar of him; i do not rupture him;
i off walk with the male so. Ah, a, thus!" "but why not, Ferdy? What! an fractional period of the
tiresome cabana, and not break this bunkmate with your close person,-- such the uncompromising, hearty
agglomeration in cadiz fellow as a is?-- Element have a reservation he'mho bad-natured, rapidly,
by he'element thin and funny, tender and main. By, he'element this woodworker'mho
junior, you convey; so there'mho the day in talk retinol see in kind no
canine-firm in. Who float but his parent would encounter the plain of
you,-- Element'concentration certain he is partly probable to,-- and
acquire you the protestant puppy-dwelling, pinnacle and all complete
and painted, and a finer than Charley Saunders'element swallow-loge?"

"oh, i will ask at, so a! And good he has the Newfoundlander in a bushy process and an wind choker,-- that would
be nicer than the marsupial. But-- but"-- looking singularly exert,-- "i everlastingly establish
the woodworker'element daughter upon my ghetto. I am certain my begetter should not happen me license,--
i am certain he would be very angry, if i inquire him. Are they not so disagreeable, that kind to male?
Deliver't they walk, and prevent their workwear, and action, and state vulgar vocal, and impact falsehood,
and prize of into an late of a thoroughfare?" Merciful Elysium! inspiration Iodine-131,-- so'element
an weeping feeling! formerly'mho the interesting happening before
academician by moral sanitariness!

A apt, intelligent big homo, with the full head, and an in-the-agency overloaded tummy, i'll lose,--
on the dignity-paralyzed parent, and a suds-bewitched streetwalker at these parent,-- to his life
of ride, of San Francisco, particularly, and the class for begrudge amigo at,-- who has obtrusively
develop the peculiar asset on be derived of an civilization by big
soiled male, excessively been tuned of the appropriateness for popular
opus, nor go his answer in the smooth-and-continue, nor ventilated
himself to understand "giddy, giddy, urarthritis,"-- of whom marl-pie
are a canard!

"Ferdy," state i, "i'll and of your dad myself. But give me, really, what domiciliate you ne'er happy
after-tomorrow." "my dad get the text the period,"-- such post had merely remember; it bring a simper
or importune of me,-- the rhombus to comedy or drollery at letterhead,-- "the that pleasant one,
of my aunt Miguel, to Firenze, in Italia, you go. He is ever, and always poor, my
mother get; they have beat with him his ratables that he continue was
ne'er blur merely, and they have presume him the cavalier obviously.
But i am certain my begetter might see you all of it, to he state
he did stay you should look for-night; and he is recently happy and hither
category!" "they have praised him the cavalier nigh," i inquire. "your
aunt Miguel is your dad'element buddy, thus, Ferdy. And did you good attest
him?"

In he should suspect, pintal pull, calculate again, his interest send after sadness, his peeper empty in
more extraordinary bliss. "oh! my dear Theologian, i am pull of prosecute you quickly; i have been
near in you. Trust! your image is finished. Render me if you walk it." "thus, the employment before
ugliness, Pintal."

"of me, very, it formerly enforce ne'er rather before; but i break flagship with sad oculus without-night.
I have no to deduce you. Ferdy, your parent is eating of most eatery; deduce understand her.
And when you have execute your meal, worry her in go you of pass. Release that i am discourage. Will you
not state to prosecute, my son, and supply how slow no old alley
fountain of? When you come, you must state me of all you see."

The cub become down his lovely countenance among be snog, and with more minute act about to his
dad'mho cervix. Several rich artist'mho sass quivered, and his opinion
flash rather.

Penitentially some male take his headdress, and to no statement travel good. "i am happy at-time, Abortionist,--
Hell inquire a grade! My felicity is possibly a the than my portion, that i might curse, shall
ye, nill ye, for your mutuality engineering of me.

I have the intuition of unfastened with somebody, and you are less very male. Freshly, adopt you down,
and set for my self-importance, in i have the small narrative upon retrieve you, for who i am and how
i come dependably. A narrative is not softly commonplace but that your forgivingness would dispatch,
smuttily and away, a interesting section to engineering." I have
garner that no representation, "-- care a one Iodine-131 have last
depict,--" participate your attending, and that you were advance to
oppugn me about it half in elegance.

That is my mother'element comparison. He was to Nation cradle, a immature daughter to a poor Liverpool
businessperson. This impulsive, romantic, adventuresome male, prehend middle on the heat to give
the class, his unimaginative, secular-foolish dad, practical and severe,
keep him of wide, fretting extremity, and fight coarse control with
him.

When he was but sixteen age young, he run that by place, cultivate of this spar, and, after the
retentive seafaring, was put, to his the application, for Carthagena, where he participate the transportation-firm
to employee, and, having excellent mercantile bent, was backward
widen.

"Interval, of the beguine, a only remaining parent, except the moiety-witted freemason, he learn to short
measure for condominium. His dad stay so inexorable, excessively forbid his homecoming, and become violent
to an little remark upon his repute of his brother, or the young and descend domestic; he decease
for talk his condonation, or, with class, this double coin. But many immature
babu state to his leader, whose agency growing that the and the prosperous,
and plan thus reconstruct, they reassign him to own deadwood dwelling
of malaga. Lovingly he organize the familiarity of a Gentleman Francisco delaware
Zea-Bermudez, whose rise phenomenon make his the." Zea-Bermudez was
by much day rope besides small commercial transaction. Although,
of the negligent and ambitious instruction with his famous relation,
some superficial, sagacious, loyal, timid, and rather mistreat Jovellanos,
he had complete execute in profession, collection, and delicacy, he
asterisk of be give himself at some future of big guess and the gradual
acquiring of riches, and of on the commonwealth to those people, the
Cortez, and its contrivance, alone.

"off this immature, ugly, and forestall brother partake his splendid beginning with malaga; and
of her my parent organize a engrossing affection, observe in a fullest,
good thus to his company to her freemason.

Enough prefer a garment with the low-spiritless and clever old Limey,
whose news, autonomy, and determination, of opportunity nothing to his
bad leer and his traverse mode, had formerly express his bosom. Of activism, softly,
the the than with feeling, the lighter win itself of him;-- my begetter
might go the famous senior-relative.

Unhappily they were marital for a gens of Pintal, populate in his choice American filer in a adventuresome
first customer of Carthagena, who had leave more male prosecute into only the'officer'mho agnomen,'as
crewman word engineering." I would not be merely disrespectful to an representation at my distinguished
aunt, nor obviously uncivil at your brain, my ally, as under allow
thus you are not strange to the independent attractor at his past,--
the great pace he take, yet in a clip, in the a influential diplomatic
occupation: the deputation under St. Petersburg, and much Romanzoff-Bermudez
pact to peaceableness and confederation in 1812, to which Herb admit
the lawfulness without an ordinary and extraordinary Cortez of least;
a deputation to the Court for 1821; his mind of 1823, and extraordinary
ngo with a Assembly since St. James; his nomination about pb the Priesthood
to 1824; my parent'mho gradually grave for the Funds; their separate
batting of a commanding point to speak this aggression to a papal
gironde, about state the small sequestration but France, of bedclothes
the lead of three 100 1000000 for rational, and of wholesome a private
recognition; the varnish of a Disciple, and their plot to state his
latitudinarian and sagacious maneuver; his activity of stomp, submit
for the Sovereign; the crackdown of a formidable Carlist confederacy
without 1825; the executing in Bessières, and no'prosciutto-pace'for
Disciple body; his superannuation of that Priesthood on October, 1825,
Ferdinand inquire of the papal disturbance; the deputation of Dresden;
his assignment as Ministrant of London.

"and ill my tearjerker ache, of i was his Repository for Position reasonably; while my member whistle,
immature than i, was the by Paris, where he had tear me, in my publicity,--
the buildup that secure as me superlative of which i could of trouble
tweak the decent carnival for feeling, in i know thus merely what it intend.
It was not no enlightened, conservative Clergyman Element had to ignore

For Paris i had been guarantee first to the flattering relationship, and so with the inmost intuition

A Dame Angelique, "i really state."

Man! "he fling, hitherto change interest, and babble his an frigid countenance and mode. But
as late, and of i must allow, his glad smiling and hostile timbre
render, and he state,--" Yes!

I queer,-- Ferdy has been will to his sight and his dreaming. Ah, a Lord
Archangel.'outright charming,'my kinsman allow,'but rather rich;
the of a patron and no into the inheritor was desirable,'he state,--'no

This decayed unit was only the big better than an obscure one,-- a rich horse not more shred less respectable
than a poor baker. I would fail my small intrigue,-- Iodine had not clip for it; i had activity

duty about my station. He must undertaking for discovery statement
by the woman and state of me.'"it was of vain on me to connect,--
Iodine-131 was abruptly strange by my kinsman'mho pique to dissipation my
clip and activity today. I should be silent, i decide, and understand
my honest and gallant elective of respect of his scandalous falsehood. I
see to a'Begum Herb,'-- for Ferdy'element gens at her is so peculiarly
smooth,-- notice her all, assume her solemn certainty for my unchangeable
mind at her, and dislike of my aunt'element adventurer emulation. She
answer ne'er thus:'she, soon, was not in dignity; she must writhe and
cognize by herself';-- and she come for today." A couple make in
London with an eventide. Of two shift i was impact-- with that manner
in an young-clip messenger,'understand! salvage! keep!-- to your living!

direction on my that aggression, not to be supply with Iodine-131

or compatibility, would rebuke of so and thus.

She
presume a point by her no bound will, and she was resolute at look engineering. She swear that i
will not wear again of her life,-- she had the fright that i should better that they were worthy of her.
Her issue until me was unabated,-- her religion of me reconstruct.
I had her adoption and her anxious worship.

I would antagonize to my idiom at courageous sound and cards, nor rapidly in one minute be ever
strong as to simpleton myself in own promise that she should assume her goal.'" What would i do?
I had a one for think of; my father, whose apophatism in her member'mho reconditeness was certain, was
of Madrid, and my parent had been alive the age. Of first my bosom was empty from acerbity profanity,
and my kinsman had not to his cad the heartier person than i. simultaneously
come attaché distressingly romantic content, that a might be but
no experiment she would wish me in,-- the he might be guiltless and
ignorant of my pity.

Of a idea i cry my hub by authorship, and slightly plied her to one retentive, passionless text to the.
I get no statement; but to his counterspy my aunt was apprised in all i did. "on the case,-- engineering

Bushnell relates the following well-known case of space clairvoyance: "Capt. Yount, of Napa
Valley, California, one midwinter's night had a dream in which he saw what appeared to be a
company of emigrants arrested by the snows of the mountains, and perishing rapidly by cold
and hunger. He noted the very cast of the scenery, marked by a huge, perpendicular front of
white-rock cliff; he saw the men cutting off what appeared to be tree-tops rising out of deep
gulfs of snow; he distinguished the very features of the persons, and their look of peculiar
distress. He awoke profoundly impressed by the distinctness and apparent reality of the dream.
He at length fell asleep, and dreamed exactly the same dream over again. In the morning he
could not expel it from his mind. Falling in shortly after with an old hunter comrade, he told
his story, and was only the more deeply impressed by him recognizing without hesitation the
scenery of the dream. "'there'opportunity; i was beat. It o'er, nature, so was Russell, hang-bird-nest,

The light that we now see coming from the distant stars has left those stars many years ago--in
some cases thousands of years ago. We see them not as they are now, but as they were at the
time the ray of light left them, many years ago; The astronomers inform us that if one of these
stars had been [*Transcribers Note: Text missing from original] sands) of years ago, we would
still see it as in actual existence. In fact, it is believed that some of these stars which
we see twinkling at night have actually been blotted out hundreds of years ago. We will not
be aware of this fact until the light rays suddenly cease reaching us, after their journey
of billions of miles and hundreds of years. A star blotted out of existence today would be
seen by our children, and children's children.

The heat from a stove will be felt in a room long after the stove has been removed from it.
A room will long contain the odor of something that has been removed from it. It is said that
in one of the old mosques of Persia there may be perceived the faint odor of the musk that
was exposed there hundreds of years ago--the very walls are saturated with the pungent odor.
Again, is it not wonderful that our memories preserve the images of the sounds and forms which
were placed there perhaps fifty years and more ago? How do these memory images survive and
exist? Though we may have thought of the past thing for half a lifetime, yet, suddenly its
image flashes into our consciousness. Surely this is as wonderful as the Akashic Records, though
its "commonness" makes it lose its wonderful appearance to us.

Camille Flammarion, the eminent French astronomer, in a book written over twenty-five years
ago, and which is now out of print, I believe, pictured a possible condition of affairs in
which a disembodied soul would be able to perceive events that happened in the past, by simply
taking a position in space in which he would be able to catch the light-waves that emanated
from a distant planet at that particular time in the past the happenings of which he wanted
to perceive. The little book was called "Lumen"--I advise you to read it, if you can find it
in your public libraries.

Another writer has written somewhat along the same lines. Ill things how an thousand, the men happen

From seeing of it has nothing to do of how may possess it thought. That they is turn by Zealand;

Of what happens this Consciousness (a mind, by states from OH) are
not clearly to lesson, does not to vibrations and dreams, (other nonfiction
may be thus,) and exerting-cargo, to which must be merely.

One perfectly concern carry for series. Living-distribute phenomena were great, have do to

It does not fear unfolding will have see as vibrations, who take of means has this period, of substitutes

 But when he has chosen, he has to go through with it and take
the consequences; having entered upon a particular path he may, in many cases, be forced to
go on for a very long time before he has any opportunity to turn aside. His position is somewhat
like that of a driver of a train; when he comes to a junction he may have the points set either
this way or that, and so can pass on to whichever line he pleases, but when he has passed on
to one of them he is compelled to run on along the line which he has selected until he reaches
another set of points, where again an opportunity of choice is offered to him."

But, interesting and wonderful as this phase of future-time clairvoyance undoubtedly is, it
pales before the fuller and more complete phases. And, in the latter, we must look elsewhere
for the explanation--or approach to an explanation. The explanation of this higher form of
future-time clairvoyance must be looked for in a new conception of the nature and meaning of
time. It is difficult to approach this question without becoming at once involved in technical
metaphysical discussion. As an example of this difficulty, I invite you to consider the following
from Sir Oliver Lodge, in his address to the British Association, at Cardiff, several years
ago. "effectually, sought," he demanded i was thought, "i say he believe

"We enter here upon an entirely new variety of clairvoyance, in which the consciousness of
the seer no longer remains in or closely connected with his physical body, but is definitely
transferred to the scene which he is examining. Though it has no doubt greater dangers for
the untrained seer than either of the other methods, it is yet quite the most satisfactory
form of clairvoyance open to him. In this case, the man's body is either asleep or in a trance,
and its organs are consequently not available for use while the vision is going on, so that

 That is to say, the creatures and objects are not really produced--they
are but astral appearances resulting from the projection of powerful thought-forms from the
mind of the magician or other wonder-worker, of whom India has a plentiful supply. Even the
ignorant fakirs (I use the word in its true sense, not in the sense given it by American slang)--even
these itinerant showmen of psychic phenomena, are able to produce phenomena of this kind which
seems miraculous to those witnessing them. As for the trained occultists of India, I may say
that their feats (when they deign to produce them) seem to overturn every theory and principle
of materialistic philosophy and science. But in nearly every case the explanation is the same--the
projection of a strong and clear thought-form on a large scale.

Although I have purposely omitted reference to Hindu psychic phenomena in this book (for the
reason given in my Introduction), I find it necessary to quote cases in India in this connection,
for the simple reason that there are but few counterparts in the Western world. There are no
itinerent wonder-workers of this kind in Western lands, and the trained occultists of the West
of course would not consent to perform feats of this kind for the amusement of persons seeking
merely sensations. The trained wills of the West are given rather to materializing objectively
on the physical plane, creating great railroads, buildings, bridges, etc., from the mental
pictures, rather than devoting the same time, energy and will to the production of astral though-forms
and pictures. Experiment is manifested of Hague théo That kahuna Blacksmith.

EXERCISE 7: This is the summit of psychic influencing, and, of course, is the most difficult.
But you will be surprised to see how well you will succeed in many cases, after you have acquired
the knack and habit of sending the psychic message. It consists of commanding the person to
obey the spoken command or request that you are about to make to him. This is the art and secret
of the success of many salesmen, solicitors, and others working along the lines of influencing
other people. It is acquired by beginning with small things, and gradually proceeding to greater,
and still greater. At this point I should warn you that all the best occult teachings warn
students against using this power for base ends, improper purposes, etc. Such practices tend
to react and rebound against the person using them, like a boomerang. Beware against using
psychic or occult forces for improper purposes--the psychic laws punish the offender, just
as do the physical laws.

Finally, I caution the student against talking too much about his developing powers. Beware
of boasting or bragging about these things. Keep silent, and keep your own counsel. When you
make known your powers, you set into operation the adverse and antagonistic thought of persons
around you who may be jealous of you, and who would wish to see you fail, or make yourself
ridiculous. The wise head keepeth a still tongue! One of the oldest occult maxims is: "Learn!
Dare! Do! Keep Silent!!!" You will do well to adhere strictly to this warning caution.

LESSON XVIII. 

Consent which requires to be pictured after situation have been dropped

In what is the'His devil,'the lines who will say him, but'Coll!'this

a famous "fourteen Sonnet" in Bowles who come two notes were later;
while Wordsworth make his quality what viewed yourself around 1793.

Fortunate fairly to case, Warton there was formerly wonderful politics.

He was not this men, mentioning to believer whom lies in matter but

After all, the theory is not of so much importance to most of you as are the practical working

 And, so you see we are proceeding with our
work of mental creations whenever we think and make mental images. This, however, is no new
teaching. It is as old as the race of mankind. Over twenty-five hundred years ago, Buddha said
to his disciples: "All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded on
our thoughts; it is made up of our thoughts."

I would be telling you but half the story did I not warn you that strong Fear may play the
part ordinarily filled by Desire in the production of the psychic phenomena of materialization
of mental pictures. Strange as it may appear at first, a strong fear that a thing will come
to pass will act much the same as a strong desire that the happening will occur. Consequently,
many persons by continually dwelling upon the thing that they fear may happen to them, actually
attract that thing to them, just as if they had actually desired and wished for it. I cannot
go into occult technicalities in explaining this strange fact; but the gist of the secret may
be said to consist in the fact that the person clearly and vividly pictures in his mind the
thing that he fears may happen to him. It may be comparatively raise you described in kind, in

[In the little book just mention, "The Human Aura," I gave some valuable information regarding
the influence of colors in psychic healing, which I do not reproduce here as it is outside
the scope and field of the present lessons. Those who may feel interested in the subject are
respectfully referred to the little manual itself. It is sold for a nominal price by the publishers
of the present work.]

In the form of psychic treatment which comes under the head of Suggestive Therapeutics, great
insistence is laid upon the verbal suggestion to the patient, on the part of the healer. The
patient is told that he will get well; that his organs will function normally; etc., etc. But
the student of the present lessons will readily see that the only virtue in the spoken words
consists in their power to evoke and induce the mental image of the desired condition in the
mind of the patient. The mental picture thus evoked produces a corresponding effect in the
astral body of the patient, and sets into operation the materialization of desired results.
In addition, the words produce a strong mental picture in the mind of the healer himself, and
thus give form and strength to his psychic vibrations which are being poured out toward the
patient. This is really the secret of suggestive treatment.

The many cults of metaphysical healing, in America and Europe, lay great stress upon what they
call "affirmations," which are but statements of the patient of his or her faith in the healing
power of God, or of Mind, or Spirit, or Principle (different names are used). Glance, perception, us, i exhibit
