The spiritual condition of this church in Paul's time is worthy of notice; for it presents
a striking contrast with its condition at the time when the special message of the Revelation
was addressed to it. Paul in his epistle to the Ephesians taught them the glorious doctrine
of entire sanctification (chap. 5:25-27), and they had received the experience; for he gives
them the express command, "Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the
day of redemption." Chap. 4:30. And again, "After that ye believed, ye were sealed with that
holy Spirit of promise." Chap. 1:13. Their ministers, also, had been placed in their position
by authority of the Holy Ghost, and were commanded to feed the flock. See Acts 20:28. When
this was their heavenly experience, their "first works" of patience, love, and perseverance,
were acceptable unto Christ; but it was not their present condition. A sad declension had taken
place; therefore the declaration, "I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy
first love." This was no mere human estimate placed upon their piety, but it was their condition
as Christ himself knew it to be. He "who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks,"
and knoweth the hearts of all men, declared they had fallen, and commanded them to repent and
to do the first works. How sad that a congregation which had one time enjoyed the fulness of
God's favor should fall from grace and be threatened with destruction by the Lord himself!
But there is one consolation to be obtained from the experience of this church, and that is,
that even if persons have enjoyed an experience of pardon and of sanctification and have lost
it, there is a possibility of their recovering the favor of God, provided they "repent, and
do the first works."

But Christ, who in chapter 1:5 is said to be "the faithful witness," will not overlook anything
that is good, nor censure a congregation unjustly. He finds in this church one fact worthy
of commendation--their abhorrence of the deeds of the Nicolaitans. The infamous practises attributed
to this party are promiscuous sexual intercourse and the eating of things sacrificed to idols.
It is said to have derived its name from Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, who was one of the
seven deacons appointed by the church at Jerusalem, Acts 6:5. But there is no satisfactory
evidence that Nicolas was its founder; and it is the belief of many, that the sect attributed
their origin to him simply to gain the prestige of his name. However, its mention in this connection
is sufficient proof that at this time those corrupt principles had been widely promulgated.

The letter closes with an admonition and a promise--an admonition to give heed to the things
uttered by the Spirit, and a promise of everlasting life to the overcomer. This shows that
Christ does not approve or condemn indiscriminately. If the great mass of professors continue
in their backslidden condition, the individual that gives heed to God's Word and is made an
overcomer will have a right to "the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."

What, may we ask, has been the fate of this church against which Christ uttered the threat
of removal? There is no proof that they gave heed to the exhortation to repent, and the candle-stick
has long since been taken away. Not a vestige of a church remains to mark the site of this
once important congregation; nay, the city itself is no more, the stork, the jackal, and a
few miserable Turkish huts alone remaining on the site of this once proud metropolis where
thousands congregated and cried, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!"

    8. And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These
    things saith the first and the last which was dead, and is
    alive;

    9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
    rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews,
    and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

    10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold,
    the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be
    tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful
    unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

    11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
    the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second
    death.

Smyrna was situated on a bay of the Aegean Sea, its beautiful harbor rendering it from time
immemorial one of the most important commercial cities of Asia Minor. History does not inform
us when the gospel was first introduced in this city; but at a very early date a large congregation
existed there, with the venerable Polycarp as its pastor. He suffered death by martyrdom under
the reign of Marcus Aurelius about A.D. 167.

In each of the seven letters to the churches Christ introduces himself by some appellation
significant of the character he assumes toward them. In this he styles himself "the first and
the last, which was dead, and is alive," a fact very important for that congregation to remember
during the great seasons of persecution and oppression through which they were to be called
to pass.

Against this church Christ has no words of condemnation to utter; all is encouragement and
promise. Their condition of poverty is mentioned. It is probable that this very poverty arose
because of their accepting Christianity and taking joyfully the spoiling of their goods; for
it is a well-known fact that, when individuals embrace Christianity in an idolatrous land,
they are disinherited by parents, cast out by relatives, and denied public employment. Even
the community refuses to associate with them or to render them assistance in any form. Their
means of subsistence is thus cut off, and they are harassed in every possible manner. Jas.
2:5. Their enemies may think that they have reduced them to a condition of wretchedness, but
in this the persecutors are mistaken. God says the righteous are rich. A certain writer has
remarked, "There is many a rich poor man, and many a poor rich man."

The blasphemy of opposing, self-styled Jews is next mentioned. In all probability the term
Jew is applied in its spiritual sense. Paul declares that "he is not a Jew which is one outwardly
... but he is a Jew which is one inwardly" (Rom. 2:28, 29), and that "if ye be Christ's, then
are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3:29. These persons professed
to belong to the true "Israel of God" (Gal. 6:16), but they were without salvation; and the
Smyrnaen church would not recognize them as belonging to the congregation, and therefore the
only name that could be applied to them was "the synagogue of Satan." Had they been tolerated
in the assembly of the righteous, Christ would have condemned or rebuked the church for not
performing their duty, the same as he did the churches of Pergamos and Thyatira.

Great persecutions for the church of Smyrna are predicted; but he "which was dead, and is alive
forevermore," having passed through the ordeal of suffering and death himself, stands in a
position to speak words of comfort and consolation, assuring them in the strongest terms that,
although wicked men and the devil may cast them into prison and persecute them unto the death,
yet "he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death." The overcomers are of the number
of those who, having had "part in the first resurrection, on such the second death hath no
power." Chap. 20:6. The ten days doubtless are prophetic time (which will be explained later)
and signify ten years, which was probably fulfilled in the terrible persecution that began
under the reign of Diocletian, and continued ten years, or from A.D. 302 to 312.

The subsequent history of Smyrna has been different from that of Ephesus, in that it has retained
its name and importance until the present day, being the greatest commercial city in the Levant.
It has a population of more than two hundred thousand, several thousand of whom belong to the
Greek and Armenian churches. The light there has become dimmed, but let us pray that God will
soon remember the faith and perseverance of his ancient servants and again trim the lamps that
once shone so brightly.

    12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These
    things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

    13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where
    Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not
    denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my
    faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

    14.

    15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
    Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

    16. Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will
    fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

    17.

Pergamos was a city of considerable importance, the ancient metropolis of the province of Mysia
and the residence of the Attalian kings.

The description here given of Christ is in accordance with the character of the church addressed
and the work he found necessary to perform in it. They are said to be located "where Satan's
seat is." Pergamos was a city reputed to be "sacred to the gods" and was one of the headquarters
of idolatry. There are numerous such cities now among the Hindoos and other idolatrous nations.
These cities are regarded with peculiar veneration and sanctity, and they contain the most
honored temples. In the midst of such surroundings the influences against Christianity would
be very great.

The congregation is commended because of its loyalty and steadfastness during a period of persecution
in which Antipas was slain. When this persecution occurred, we are not informed; and as to
the identity of Antipas, we are also left in uncertainty. Some suppose him to have been the
elder of the church.

Christ censures them severely, however, for tolerating persons in their midst who held the
doctrine of Balaam and the pernicious sentiments of the Nicolaitans, and he threatens to fight
against them with the sword of his mouth unless they repent. When Balak desired Balaam to pronounce
a curse against Israel, God by various means miraculously prevented Balaam's doing so; but
Balaam craftily instructed Balak to make use of the women of Moab to seduce the men of Israel
to sacrifice to their idols and to indulge in the licentious accompaniments to such idolatry.
In many places in heathen countries to-day vile women are attached to the temples of the gods,
and at certain stated feasts licentiousness becomes a sanctioned part of the religious celebration.
Balaam's plan was successful. God was displeased with Israel, and because of this fornication
there fell in one day twenty-four thousand. For a full account see Num. 22-25; 31:13-17.

It would appear that the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans were classed
as two different heresies; but the corrupt tenets of the latter were identical with those of
the former, and the probable meaning is, "As the Hebrews had Balaamites among them; so, likewise,
you have among you the Nicolaitans teaching the same pernicious doctrines." It is also a singular
fact that the Hebrew signification of Balaam and the Greek of Nicolas is the same--"subduer
of the people." Thus the doctrine of Balaam would stand as a representation of the principles
taught by the Nicolaitans.

The letter to this church also closes with an exhortation and a promise. Hidden manna and a
white stone in which is inscribed a new name are rewarded the overcomer. The interpretations
of this white stone have been various, but the difficulty seems to lie in determining which
ancient custom is meant. The most satisfactory to my mind is that contained in the following
account by Mr. Blunt:

"In primitive times, when traveling was rendered difficult from want of places of public entertainment,
hospitality was exercised by private individuals to a very great extent, of which, indeed,
we find frequent traces in all history, and in none more than in the Old Testament. Persons
who partook of this hospitality, and those who practised it, frequently contracted habits of
friendship and regard for each other, and it became a well-established custom among the Greeks
and Romans to provide their guests with some particular mark, which was handed down from father
to son, and insured hospitality and kind treatment whenever it was presented. This mark was
usually a small stone or pebble, cut in halves, upon each of which the host and the guest mutually
inscribed their names, and then interchanged with each other. The production of these stones
was quite sufficient to insure friendship for themselves or descendants whenever they traveled
again in the same direction; while it is evident that these stones required to be privately
kept, and the names written upon them carefully concealed, lest others should obtain the privileges
instead of the persons for whom they were intended." So those who have obtained salvation and
are overcomers through the blood have received the sure pledge of Christ's eternal friendship
(which those who know not God can not receive) and are invited to partake of all of his hospitalities,
even to "eat of the hidden manna," which is experienced by the truly sanctified.

    18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These
    things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame
    of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

    19. I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and
    thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
    first.

    20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because
    thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
    prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
    fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

    21. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
    repented not.

    22. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
    adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of
    their deeds.

    23. And I will kill her children with death; and all the
    churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and
    hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your
    works.

    24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many
    as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths
    of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

    25. But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

    26. And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end,
    to him will I give power over the nations:

    27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of
    a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of
    my Father.

    28. And I will give him the morning star.

    29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
    the churches.

To this congregation Christ manifests himself in the character of him "who hath his eyes like
unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine brass," denoting the fact that he is the great
discerner of all hearts and that he is able to render unto every man according to his deeds.
Whether the expression, "his feet like fine brass," has any particular signification, I am
unable to say.

This letter opens with a commendation of the works, the charity, the service, and the faith
of this church. In these things they had made considerable advancement. Nevertheless, Christ
had something against them, because they had suffered "that woman Jezebel" to teach false doctrines
and to seduce the servants of Christ to compromise with idolatry and to commit fornication.
It is improbable that Jezebel was her real name; but she was a Jezebel in character, named
in this letter after King Ahab's wicked wife, who killed the Lord's prophets, seduced her husband
into idolatry, and fed the priests of Baal at her own table. Some have supposed that this appellation
designated a number or class of people teaching these doctrines; but the manner in which "her
children," or disciples, are spoken of would seem rather to point out a particular woman--one
who was a leader and the chief instrument of mischief.

The long-suffering of Christ had been manifested in this case. He had given her an opportunity
to repent of her evil deeds, but she would not. Now he declares that he will cause his judgments
to descend upon her and her followers. By casting her into a bed is doubtless meant that he
would bring her down upon a bed of sickness and pain and thus make her a most distressing object.
Her partners in sin were to suffer "great tribulation," and "her children," or disciples, he
would kill with death, or deadly pestilence. Thus would this whole corrupt party be visited
with divine judgments according to their works; while their great pretensions to wisdom and
discernment, "as they speak," or as they term it, will be shown to be nothing but the "depths
of Satan."

The frequent references to these gross sins in the letters to the churches may seem a little
strange to us in the altered circumstances of society in which we live; but when we consider
the tone of public sentiment and the prevalence of idolatry at that time, it will be seen that
the lapse into these sins was very easy. Some compromised with the heathen by joining in their
idolatrous feasts, maintaining that the meat was not affected one way or the other, and this
proved but a stepping-stone to the licentious principles and the corrupt practises of those
with whom they thus associated.

The remainder of this letter is full of encouragement to the faithful. The only burden Christ
placed upon them was a severe censure because they tolerated that abominable party in their
midst. They were exhorted to continue faithful and were promised power over the nations. These
they should rule with a rod of iron, the same as Christ, who received this power from his Father.
The law, or rod, with which Christ, and his people with him, as kings and priests, rule the
nations is the word of God, the most unyielding law, based upon the greatest authority, ever
written. Psa. 149:5-9.

CHAPTER III.

    And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
    saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
    stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest,
    and art dead.

    2. Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
    ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before God.

    3. Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
    fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come
    on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will
    come upon thee.

    4.

    5.

    6. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
    the churches.

Sardis was one of the chief cities of western Asia Minor. It was beautifully situated on the
river Pactolus, in the middle Hermus valley, at the foot of Mount Tmolus, and was once the
capital of the kingdom of Lydia, the place of residence of Croesus and other Lydian kings.
It was a city of great opulence and splendor, and "distinguished for the voluptuous and debauched
manners of its inhabitants."

To this church Christ introduces himself as "he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the
seven stars"--that is, he has control of the Holy Spirit's agency and of his ministers. Thus,
the great spiritual agencies of the church are in his keeping to bestow or to take away as
he pleases. Considering the dead condition of this church of Sardis, it was very appropriate
for Christ thus to address himself to them. He has no words of commendation to offer, no works
of charity, service, faith, and patience of which to approve. They had works, but these were
not "perfect before God." They were threatened with sudden visitation, as unexpected as a thief
breaking in unawares upon the slumbering inmates of a dwelling in the still hours of night.
Their condition was different from that of any of the churches before mentioned. They are not
charged with such vile practises as prevailed at Pergamus and Thyatira, the doctrine of the
Nicolaitans had gained no foothold among them, yet their works were not perfect. "Thou hast
a name that thou livest, and are dead." They had maintained the external form of religion,
but the vital power of godliness was lacking.

Although Christ could not commend this church as a body, on account of their lack of spirituality,
yet he testified, "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments."
In the midst of all the cold formalism of professors and surrounded by worldliness and iniquity,
a few preserved their Christian integrity and were approved by the Lord. "Pure religion and
undefiled before God and the Father is this ... to keep himself unspotted from the world."
Jas. 1:27. All such overcomers have the promise of being clothed in white raiment ("the righteousness
of saints "--chap. 19:8) and of having their names preserved in the "book of life" in heaven
and confessed before the Father and the holy angels. Wondrous admission into the heavenly realm!
Presented to the Father and the innumerable hosts of heaven by the Lord, himself, there, amid
sacred environments, to enjoy the transcendent felicity of eternal blessedness! "They are worthy,"
saith Christ.

Although this church was threatened with sudden visitation, there is no hint given of the manner
in which this should be fulfilled, for the reason, perhaps, that it might be all the more unexpected.
The church has long since passed out of existence. The city itself has lain in ruins for centuries,
the modern village of Sart composed of a few huts inhabited by semi-nomadic Yuruks alone remaining
near the ancient site. Cattle now graze on grassy plains once traversed by streets and thronged
with the inhabitants of this superb metropolis.

    7.

    9.

    10. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
    keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all
    the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

    11. Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that
    no man take thy crown.

    12.

    13. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
    the churches.

Philadelphia was once a large and powerful city, and it continued thus until later times. Prior
to the time the Revelation was written, it had suffered severely from repeated earthquakes,
which caused it to be almost deserted by its inhabitants. Subsequently, however, it recovered
and became a prosperous, influential city.

The character Christ assumes toward this church is that of the Holy and True--one who will
justly reward them for their patience and perseverance--and by virtue of his possessing the
key of David (a symbol of power and authority), he is able to place before them an open door
which no man can shut.

The character of this church is wholly unlike that of the preceding. In that, there was nothing
to commend, but much to condemn; whereas to this, all is admonition, encouragement, and promise,
because they had "kept the word of his patience" and had not denied his name. Christ knew their
works and that they were worthy of approval. They still possessed "a little strength" and had
not denied his name.

Christ, who always upholds and rewards his faithful followers, although they be few in number
and constitute the despised of earth, was not unrighteous that he should overlook this humble
congregation of devoted disciples that had kept his word, but he made them a number of special
promises because of their faith and perseverance. The first was the assurance that he had set
before them an open door which no man could shut. A door is a means either of entrance or of
escape, and signifies that God was going to open before them a greater field of enlargement
and success, or else would furnish them a sure means of escape and protection from their cruel
and relentless persecutors. It will be remembered that the church of Smyrna also received nothing
but commendation and encouragement; but there was no promise of an open door to them. On the
contrary, they were told that they should be tried, cast into prison, and suffer tribulation
ten days. They were comforted, however, with a certain assurance of future reward and a crown
of everlasting life. But before the church of Philadelphia there was opened a scene of greater
prosperity, deliverance from enemies, greater enlargement, and the glorious prospect of seeing
multitudes of souls brought under the influence of the saving gospel of Christ.

The next promise was that of deliverance from opposing Jews, who were to be humbled before
them. This refers, doubtless, to persons who had a mere profession of Christianity and who
were not recognized by the congregation--the same as the blaspheming Jews of Smyrna. The faithfulness
of God's elect would eventually be the means of bringing them back to an experience of salvation,
so that they would worship in the midst of the church again.

Another promise to this congregation was, "I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation,
which shall come upon all the world." Some dreadful calamity is here predicted, during which
the power of God would be mercifully manifested in granting this church a special preservation.
Some suppose it to have reference to a great general persecution throughout the Roman empire,
during which the Christians of Philadelphia would be spared. This may have been the fact; but
whether it was or not, we have no means of information. When we come to consider the symbols
of chapter 9, in which the delusive error of Mohammedanism is set forth, we will see what a
period of sore trial this delusion was to the Eastern churches. It is also a fact that, in
the midst of this abounding heresy, the church of Philadelphia was preserved as was no other
church of Asia. When the followers of Mohammed were sweeping like a whirlwind over the Eastern
empire, ravaging everything before them, Philadelphia remained an independent Christian city,
when all the other cities of Asia Minor were under the power of the Saracen sword. It held
out against the Ottoman power until the year 1390 A.D., when it surrendered to Sultan Bayazid's
mixed army of Ottoman Turks and Byzantine Christians (?). This was six years after the death
of Wickliffe, "the morning star of the reformation," who opposed the corruptions of the Papacy,
gave the world the first English translation of the Bible, and sowed the seeds that soon grew
and produced a Huss, a Jerome, and a Luther. So God preserved the Christians of Philadelphia
in the East until he began raising up others to herald his truth in the West, whose labors
soon ripened into the glorious Reformation of the Sixteenth Century.

His final promise to the overcomer is that he shall be made a pillar in the temple of God,
and receive the name of God, of Christ, and of the New Jerusalem, or city of God. In some manner
the Christian is labelled with the name of God, whose property he is; with the name of Christ,
by whom he was purchased; and with the name of the New Jerusalem, or city of God, his inheritance
and eternal abiding-place; and he is made a pillar in the temple of God. By turning to Heb.
12:22, 23, we find that the general assembly and church of God in this dispensation constitutes,
in one important sense, the New Jerusalem, or city of God, in which the overcomers abide. Eph.
2:20-22. See also 1 Cor. 3:17; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Tim. 3:15.

To be a pillar in this temple of God means to occupy a conspicuous or useful position in supporting
the truth, examples of which are to be found in such characters as "James, Cephas, and John,
who seemed to be pillars" in the church in apostolic times. Gal. 2:9. In the last prayer of
Christ to the Father, he says concerning his disciples, "While I was with them in the world,
I kept them in thy name" (John 17:12); and since the church promised by Christ (Mat. 16:18)
has been established, we continually bear the name of the Father, its title being the church
or city of God. We also bear the new name of Christ, as explained in chapter 2:17, and we meet
together and worship in that name (Mat. Col. 3:17. A better understanding of the manner in
which we receive the name of God and of his city will be obtained when we come to the consideration
of the followers of a false, degenerate church represented as receiving the "mark of the beast,"
by which they are designated.

To inquire further into the history of this church, Philadelphia still remains with a population
of about fifteen thousand. It contains a number of places of public worship, a resident (Greek)
archbishop, and several inferior clergy. Mr. Keith, in his "Evidence of Prophecy," speaks of
the then presiding bishop, and says that he acknowledges "the Bible as the only foundation
of all religious belief" and admits that "abuses have entered into the church, which former
ages might endure, but the present must put down." It is also a singular coincidence that the
modern Turkish name of the city, Ala-Shehr, signifies "city of God."

This description of the church of Philadelphia I will bring to a close by adding the following
extract from Gibbon, recorded in his noted history entitled "The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire." It is of especial value since the writer, being an avowed infidel, can not be convicted
of misconstruing historical facts in order to favor Christianity.

"The captivity or ruin of the seven churches of Asia was consummated [by the Ottomans] A.D.
1312, and the barbarous lords of Ionia and Lydia still trample on the monuments of classic
and Christian antiquity. In the loss of Ephesus the Christians deplore the fall of the first
candle-stick of the Revelation. The desolation is complete; and the temple of Diana and the
church of Mary will equally elude the search of the curious traveler. The circus and three
stately theatres of Laodicea are now peopled with wolves and foxes. Sardis is reduced to a
miserable village. The God of Mohammed without a rival is invoked in the mosques of Thyatira
and Pergamus; and the populousness of Smyrna is supported by the foreign trade of the Franks
and Armenians. Philadelphia alone has been saved by prophecy or courage. At a distance from
the sea, forgotten by the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her valiant sons
defended their religion and freedom above fourscore years, and at length capitulated with the
proudest of the Ottomans. Among the Greek colonies of Asia, Philadelphia is still erect--a
column in a scene of ruins--a pleasing example that the path of honor and safety may sometimes
be the same." Vol. VI., p. 229.

    14. And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
    These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the
    beginning of the creation of God;

    15. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I
    would thou wert cold or hot.

    16. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
    I will spue thee out of my mouth.

    17.

    19.

    21.

    22. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
    the churches.

Laodicea was one of the wealthiest cities of Asia Minor. It was built upon some low hills,
and occupied an important situation in the center of a very fertile district. It was famous
for its money transactions and for the beautiful soft wool grown by the sheep of the country,
which facts are both alluded to in the message. Verses 17, 18. During the reign of Tiberius
Cæsar it was entirely destroyed by an earthquake, but its wealthy inhabitants rebuilt it immediately.
A Christian church was soon planted there; for Paul makes the request that his epistle to the
Colossians be read in the church of Laodicea and that his epistle to the church of Laodicea
(which was not included in the New Testament canon) be read unto them. Col. 4:16.

The condition of this church, according to the burden of the message, was worse than that of
any of the others; for there is not only no commendation of former faith and piety, but it
is not even said of them, as of the church at Sardis, that a few names were left who had not
defiled their garments. Christ, who here represents himself in the character of the "faithful
and true Witness," testifies that they are "neither cold nor hot." They did not have enough
piety nor zeal to cause them to do anything for the honor of Christ and his cause, neither
were they open enemies. They were merely lukewarm, insincere friends, and, as such, were in
a position to do the greatest harm. A certain writer has said, "We always dread a professed
but insincere friend; he is the least desirable of all relations."

They are further described as being satisfied to remain in their lukewarm condition, indulging
themselves in the riches and the pleasures of this life. Theirs was a rich, prosperous, influential
church in their estimation, and they were proud of it; but "the faithful and true Witness"
declares that they were "wretched, and poor, and blind, and naked." What a contrast this congregation
presents with the churches of Smyrna and Philadelphia, whose poverty and "little strength"
are expressly mentioned, but who were rich in spirituality, and who received no reproof, but
words of comfort! They of Laodicea possessed no true gold from the mine of gospel truth, no
white raiment of righteousness to hide their spiritual nakedness, no clear vision to enable
them to discern the things of the Spirit. In fact, they lacked everything necessary to constitute
a church of which the Lord could approve and which would be an honor to his cause. But notwithstanding
their sad condition, Christ still pleads with them to repent of their doings and to allow him
to come in and sup with them, promising the overcomer the privilege of sharing the throne of
his Redeemer.

On account of their lukewarmness a severe threat was uttered--"I will spue thee out of my mouth."
Allusion is doubtless made to the former catastrophe that overthrew the city under Tiberius,
thus giving them warning of the destruction that might come upon them in the future. The result
has been in accordance with the prediction. God spued that church out of his mouth centuries
ago, and nothing remains of that proud, wealthy city. Not even a Turk has any fixed residence
on the spot. Its ruins alone remain in their desolation, "rejected of God, deserted of man,
its glory a ruin, its name a reproach." The Encyclopædia Britannica says, "Its ruins are of
wide extent.... There is no doubt, however, that much has been buried beneath the surface by
the frequent earthquakes to which the district is exposed."

The prophecies concerning these individual churches have been fulfilled; so that even infidelity
itself bears witness to the "strange verification of Apocalyptic promise and threatening."
Two of the churches, Ephesus and Laodicea, where no spiritual souls remained, were threatened
with utter extinction. They are now in utter ruins--forsaken, desolate. Sardis, too, where
only a few names were left, is reduced to a small Turkish village, without a church or a Christian.
Pergamus and Thyatira, where much spirituality remained, but where wickedness also was tolerated,
still survive, though but mere remnants of their former greatness. While Smyrna and Philadelphia,
where Christ found nothing to condemn and to whose churches he uttered only words of comfort
and promise, remain until the present day and are the brightest spots on the whole scene, standing
like erect columns in the midst of the surrounding ruins.

I do not wish, however, to give too much prominence to the cities themselves in the fulfilment
of these prophecies. The churches located in these seven cities of Asia were doubtless the
main thing under consideration in the utterance of these promises and threatenings. Yet it
is a singular fact that the subsequent history of the cities themselves has accorded in a remarkable
degree with the nature of the prophecies uttered. It may be that God has preserved Smyrna and
Philadelphia because of the piety of their ancient inhabitants.

He who held the seven stars in his right hand and walked in the midst of the seven golden candle-sticks,
still possesses the control of his ministers and is present in the congregations of the righteous;
but let us all take warning from the example of the churches of Asia, and live such a life
of devotion, charity, faith, and patience as Christ, the "faithful and true Witness," will
approve of, that we may "walk with him in white" and have right to the "tree of life which
is in the midst of the paradise of God."

CHAPTER IV.

    2.

    3.

    4.

    5.

    7. And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast
    like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the
    fourth beast was like a flying eagle.

    8.

    9. And when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him
    that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

    10. The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
    the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
    cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

    11. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and
    power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
    they are and were created.

It is probable that the Apocalypse was communicated to John in parts, or consisted of a series
of symbolic visions. This is indicated by the expression "after this I looked," and is also
confirmed by the words following, "And immediately I was in the spirit," implying that the
vision recorded in chapter 1, which was given on the Lord's day, had been interrupted and that
a new one now began when the angel with trumpet voice gave summons for him to ascend to heaven
"in the spirit" (or under the influence of the spirit of prophecy) to behold the events of
the future, passing before him as a vast moving picture.

This fact of John's ascension to heaven to behold certain visions of the future (which begin
properly with chapter 6) will serve to explain many allusions to things said to occur in heaven,
merely signifying that John was in heaven when these things were revealed to him, although
their fulfilment was intimately connected with the affairs of the church on earth, for whose
benefit the Revelation was given and unto whom it was sent.

When the apostle ascended through the door that had been opened unto him, the first object
that met his vision and absorbed his soul was a throne with the Almighty seated upon it, around
whom all the inhabitants of heaven were assembled. No symbol of God is given, for the reason
that there is no analagous object that can be chosen as his representative. True, John saw
a throne, but that is a symbol, not of God himself, but of his supreme power and authority.
One was seated upon the throne separate from the throne itself. It is not said that a jasper
or a sardine stone was seated thereon, for that would be to make such an object the representative
of God; but he that sat on the throne "was to look upon" like a jasper or sardine stone. The
jasper mentioned was in all probability the diamond, and is described in chapter 21:11 as a
stone most precious, clear as crystal; while the sardine stone was a brilliant gem of a red
hue. This description naturally suggests the vestments of a great monarch in a position of
authority upon his throne. The main idea, then, as here expressed, is that the appearance of
the Almighty was so inexpressibly glorious that it could be likened to nothing except the beauty
of the most resplendent gems. But God himself appears in his own person, unrepresented by another,
for the reason, as above stated, that no inferior intelligence of earth or heaven can analagously
represent the uncreated Deity.

The throne of the omnipotent One was surrounded by a beautiful rainbow of emerald clearness,
and was probably a perfect one, or a complete circle, such as ours would be could it come wholly
into our sight. The rainbow on the cloud, to Noah and his descendants, constitutes the sure
pledge of God's covenant promise not to destroy the earth with another deluge; so, also, the
bow surrounding the throne is a symbol of God's covenant favor with his people eternally.

There were "lightnings and thunderings and voices" proceeding from the throne--the same outward
manifestations as heralded the Godhead when he came down on Sinai to declare his holy law.
The "seven lamps of fire burning before the throne" are said to signify the seven spirits of
God. These are not lamp-stands or candle-sticks, such as the ones in the midst of which the
Son of God walked on earth, but seven lights or flames of fire, representing the operation
of the Holy Spirit upon the hearts of men and women. Surrounding the throne also was "a sea
of glass like unto crystal." In the Greek it stands in a little different form--"And before
the throne as it were a sea of glass." Describing the same object in chapter 15:2, the Revelator
says, "I saw as it were a sea of glass." It was a broad expanse spread out before the throne
with a glassy or transparent appearance like crystal. Its signification will be made clear
hereafter.

In addition to this description of the throne and Deity, our attention is directed to certain
objects before and surrounding the throne. Four beasts and four and twenty elders are brought
to view. The word beasts is a very unfortunate translation, being necessarily associated in
our minds with the brute creation. It is not the word therion, which in thirty-five instances
in the Apocalypse is translated beast, denoting an animal of wild disposition, but the word
zoon, which signifies "a living creature," and is thus rendered by many of the translators
of the New Testament. Their being full of eyes signifies sleepless vigilance and superior intelligence
and discernment. The chief description given of the first living creature is that it was "like
a lion." It is stated, not that the creature was a lion, but that it was "like a lion." It
possessed some peculiar quality characteristic of the lion; namely, strength and courage. The
second living creature, "like a calf," or, more properly, the ox, is symbolic of sacrifice
or of patient labor. The third, with "a face as a man," denotes reason and intelligence. While
the fourth, "like a flying eagle," is an emblem of swiftness and far-sighted vision.

But the peculiar qualities thus symbolized are possessed by the four living creatures themselves,
and what do they represent? To whom are the four and twenty elders referred? They are particularly
distinguished from the angelic throng. In the ninth verse of the following chapter the elders
and the living creatures represent themselves as the host of people redeemed by the blood of
Christ "out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation." The above-mentioned characteristics,
then, are the peculiar possession of God's people--power and courage to attack all enemies
and to gain the victory; a spirit of perseverance in patiently laboring for Christ, with a
willingness to sacrifice their lives, if necessary, for the glory of God; ability to receive
a "knowledge of the truth," that they may understand the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning
them; and power and willingness to obey instantly when able to discern spiritual things, rising
above the things of earth and the trials and persecutions of life--soaring away to loftier
heights, there to bask continually in the blessed sunlight of God's eternal presence.

Why was it necessary that the redeemed company of God's people should be represented by four
living creatures? Doubtless because it would probably have been very difficult to select any
one creature combining all the characteristics desired to represent all God's people of all
ages. It is also a significant fact that all the people of God on earth were included in four
great dispensations--ante-deluvian, post-deluvian, Mosaic, and Christian; although it is not
certain that four living creatures were selected for the special purpose of showing the number
of dispensations. However, this division of time is well established in the Bible. Peter reckons
a new world beginning with Noah (2 Pet. 3:6, 7), stating that the old world had been destroyed.
2 Pet. 2:5. God came down upon Mount Sinai and delivered the old covenant, thus marking a distinct
dispensation; while Jesus Christ established the new covenant and ushered in the fourth and
last dispensation. See Heb. 12:18-24. Under the first dispensation, Abel by faith offered unto
God an "excellent sacrifice"; men "began to call upon the name of the Lord" (Gen. 4:26); Enoch
"walked with God" and "was translated that he should not see death"; while Noah, "a preacher
of righteousness," was "perfect in his generation" and "condemned the world" by his preaching
and obedience. The second dispensation was graced with a faithful Abraham, who "staggered not
at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith," from which circumstance he
was called "the friend of God" and has justly received the title "father of the faithful."
In his footsteps followed Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses. The law age contains the names of
many illustrious prophets of God, and the New Testament era abounds with brilliant examples
of faith and devotion.

The ministry of John the Baptist can not be said to form another dispensation, because of its
short duration (he preceding Christ but six months), and being at the time unknown outside
of a very limited territory. Another dispensation could not be begun and completed while the
old covenant dispensation was yet in force; for that would make two dispensations in full force
at the same time--a thing impossible. Also, John's work, according to the evangelist, marks
the beginning of the gospel dispensation (Mark 1:1-4), from which time the kingdom of God was
preached and men pressed into it. Luke 16:16.

It was by virtue of the future atonement-work of Christ that any were enabled to enjoy God's
favor in Old Testament times. Of noise which a symbol was meant doubtless meant before waters

 19:8), while crowns represent special power
and authority. God's ministers possess both. They are made righteous through the blood of the
everlasting covenant and are given power over all the power of the enemy and authority to heal
the sick and to cast out devils.

The entire company are engaged in worshiping God unceasingly, the elders casting their crowns
before the throne, thus ascribing all praise, honor, and glory to Him who has delegated to
them the authority they possess. And may we, my brethren, never grow weary in well-doing and
conclude that the worship of God grows monotonous; but let us, with heart and soul, join the
universal chorus, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty."

CHAPTER V.

    And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book
    written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.

    2.

    3. And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
    was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

    4. And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
    to read the book, neither to look thereon.

    5. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
    Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to
    open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

    6.

    7. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
    that sat upon the throne.

    8.

    9. And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we
    shall reign on the earth.

    11.

    13. And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
    under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in
    them, heard it saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and
    power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
    Lamb for ever and ever.

    14. And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty
    elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and
    ever.

The vision of this chapter is but a continuation of the preceding one, being a sublime description
of the exaltation and office-work of Christ in his two-fold character as the Lion of the tribe
of Juda and as a sacrificial offering for the sins of the world. The Apocalypse opens with
the words, "The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him," and it is fitting that
his special prerogatives and characteristics, together with the true position he occupies,
should first be revealed. This was especially necessary in view of the fact to be revealed,
that another would soon arise usurping the rights and prerogatives belonging to Christ alone,
claiming to be supreme head of the church, sitting as God in the temple of God, and "showing
himself that he is God." 2 Thes. 2:4.

The attention of John was directed to an object "in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne"--a
book sealed with seven seals--and to a mighty angel calling with a loud voice for some one
to come forward and loose the seals and open the book. No created intelligence of earth or
heaven dared to step forward and declare himself able to accomplish the result required, and
because of this John wept much.

The form of books in use when the Revelation was given was unlike those used now. They consisted
of strips of parchment or other material, longer or shorter, rolled up. The book in the symbolic
vision before us consisted of a roll containing seven pieces each one rolled and sealed separately,
so that the outer seal could be broken and the contents of its strip read without disturbing
the remaining ones. Had the seals all been on the outside, nothing could have been read until
they were all broken; whereas the loosing of each seal was followed by some discovery of the
contents of the roll.

This book in the hand of God is symbolical of something. Most of the commentators think it
represents the book of Revelation, in which case, of course, it would not include the present
description of the book itself, but only of its contents as applied to subsequent chapters.
But this view, of itself, is unsatisfactory for many reasons. The rules governing the use and
the interpretation of symbolic language would forbid the thought of one book's symbolizing
another book; for the main idea conveyed by the term symbol is, that the symbolic object stands
as the representative, not of itself, but of something analagous. Reasoning by analogy, what
would the contents of a sealed book in the hand of God symbolize? Evidently, the infinite counsels
and purposes known only to Jehovah. Its being written within and on the backside would indicate
that those purposes were full and complete, being all written out and understood by him who
"knoweth the end from the beginning" and "worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."
Its being sealed denotes that the contents were unrevealed, while its being in the right hand
of God--the hand of his power--shows that he is able to carry into execution his divine purposes
and that none shall be able to alter them or to wrest them from him.

While the events future of John's time form a part of the great plan and counsels of Jehovah,
yet it is taking a very limited view of the subject to suppose that they alone constitute the
sealed book of this vision; for then would that greatest of all events, the atonement of Christ
and the earliest triumphs of the gospel, have no special part in the sealed, mysterious counsels
of the infinite One. It is much more consistent with the characteristics and attributes of
God to make this book a symbol, not merely of a part, but of all his divine plans and purposes
in the entire gospel dispensation. This position gains credence from the fact that the visions
of the Revelation cover many times the whole period from the incarnation to the end. When the
very first seal is broken, the early success and triumphs of the gospel, as experienced in
John's lifetime, are portrayed. According to the vision before us, it was by virtue of Christ's
death that he was able to open the book at all; and the plan of redemption itself, which is
based upon his atonement, is declared by the Scriptures to be a "mystery which from the beginning
of the world hath been hid in God." Eph. 3:9. This redemption scheme was the great center of
attraction to the prophets of the old dispensation, who "inquired and searched diligently"
that they might comprehend its deep mysteries, "which things the angels desired to look into."
1 Pet. 1:10-12.

Now, if the contents of the sealed book were (at the time of this vision) only the history
of events to be, why was it that no man on earth or in heaven, nor even an angel before the
throne, was found worthy to "look into" it or to communicate its secrets to the children of
men. Gabriel was sent as a worthy messenger to communicate to Daniel a long series of future
events reaching even until the end of time. But the contents of this roll were such that no
created intelligence of earth or heaven was able to unfold them. All remained unfathomable
mystery--until Christ stepped forward in his character as a sacrificial Lamb and declared himself
able to undertake the task of loosing the seals and of opening the book. "Unto you it is given
to know the mystery of the kingdom of God" Col. 1:26. "Verily I say unto you, That many prophets
and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and
to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. Blessed are your eyes, for they
see; and your ears, for they hear." Mat. 13:17, 16.

The fact that the suffering and death of Christ was a past event at the time when the Revelation
was given does not constitute a valid objection to the position taken, that the contents of
the sealed book embrace the plan of redemption during the entire period of its operation; for
the reason that, in order to form a complete and continuous narrative, past events are frequently
referred to in the Apocalypse. Thus, John saw a beast with seven heads signifying seven kings;
but he was expressly informed that "five are fallen, one is [exists at present], and the other
is not yet come." Chap. 17:10.

When Christ appears on the symbolic stage, he is introduced by the elder as "the Lion of the
tribe of Juda," and "the Root of David." The lion, being the king of beasts and the monarch
of the forest, is indicative of power, such as Christ possesses. Christ is elsewhere denominated
"King of kings and Lord of lords," and he himself laid claim to "all power in heaven and on
earth," it having "pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell." Why he is termed
"the Lion of the tribe of Juda," I am unable to say, unless the expression is borrowed from
the prophecy recorded of him in Gen. 49:10--"The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a
lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the
people be." His being the "Root of David" shows that he is the source and sustainer of David
as to his position and power. David was specially ordained of the Lord and sustained by him.
Of this there can be no doubt. David was a type; Christ is the antitype. David's position as
ruler over natural Israel constitutes a type of Christ's position as ruler over the spiritual
Israel; and it is in this sense that Christ reigns upon the throne of his father David. Luke
1:32, 33. And since Christ came in the line of David's descendants, he is called the offspring
of David and a rod out of the stem of Jesse. Isa. 11:1, 10. His connection with the throne
of David being evident, he is entitled to the right to reign over his people. The appellation
Lamb is one of the peculiar titles by which the Son of God is designated, having reference
to that part of his mission in which he constituted a sacrificial offering for sin. The Lamb
was said to have seven horns and seven eyes. A horn is a symbol of power, and seven, being
a sacred or perfect number, denotes the fulness of power possessed by Christ; while the seven
eyes signify the seven spirits of God, or the Holy Spirit, which, being under the direct control
of Christ, is sent forth into the world to effect the regeneration of men.

When the Lion of the tribe of Juda stepped forward and undertook the task of revealing the
secret counsels and purposes of Jehovah to the world, immediately a song of praise ascended
from the lips of the redeemed sons of earth. The song was new, adapted to a new theme, and
sung on a new occasion. This song beautifully expresses the honor due to Jesus Christ in his
office-work as Redeemer of the world, by virtue of which people out of every nation, kindred,
tongue, and people, are saved unto God and made kings and priests on the earth. Luke 2:10, 11.

Since the preaching of the gospel began, men are instructed to "seek first the kingdom of God"
(Mat. 6:33), and they "press into it" Col. 1:13. Taking our place by the side of the writer
of the Revelation, we testify with him that we are already "in the kingdom and patience of
Jesus Christ" Rom. 5:17. In this happy condition, redeemed by the blood of Jesus, our Savior,
made "a royal [kingly] priesthood" in the "holy nation" of "peculiar people" that have been
gathered out of all nations of earth (1 Pet. 2:5, 9), we feel like singing anew this glad song
of redemption in honor of Jesus, our only Lord and Savior, who is God over all, blessed forever!
Amen. And again the heavenly strain was raised to loftier heights, until the stupendous chorus
rolled around the universe, by every creature in heaven and on earth, and under the earth,
and such as are in the sea, saying, "Blessing and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him
that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever." A few gifted voices of earth
may possess such power and sweetness as almost to entrance us with their melody of song; but
what an oratorio will it be, my brethren, when, released from the narrow limits of mortality,
that sublime strain sung by the redeemed of all ages and ten thousand times ten thousand and
thousands of thousands of angels, bursts in upon our ransomed souls! Did human thought ever
reach the conception of music like this? Did the eyes of a mortal ever behold such rapturous
scenes? 1 Cor. 2:9.

This vision shows very clearly the lofty position to which Christ has been exalted, possessing
"a name which is above every name"; for the entire company of angels and redeemed saints unite
in extolling him with songs of praise, and that, too, before the very throne of the Deity and
in the presence of his infinite Majesty. Surely we can not doubt that ours is a divine Savior,
and one worthy of all praise, honor, power and dominion both now and forever.

Though John beheld this wonderful vision in heaven, yet we must remember that it was given
and recorded for the benefit of God's people upon earth. The plan of redemption was not actually
revealed in heaven, for "Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners" (1 Tim. 1:15), and
it was here that he was ordained to "taste death for every man." Heb. 2:9. The ransomed company
thus brought to view is intended to point out the redeemed of earth; for there is no salvation
to be obtained in heaven, in which place no blood was shed--the blood is one of the agents
that bears witness in the earth. 1 John 5:7, 8. The central figures of this vision were God,
the Holy Spirit, and Christ, around whom the living creatures and elders were gathered, and
they, in turn, were surrounded by the angelic throng. This entire scene was doubtless intended
to represent the exalted character of spiritual things on earth, where the plan of redemption
was revealed and the redeemed host gathered out of all nations. In a very important sense the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost all dwell in the spiritual church, or new Jerusalem, and
are thus "in the midst" of God's people, surrounded by the redeemed host who unceasingly worship
them, and they, in turn, have the promise that "the angel of the Lord encampeth round about
them" (Psa. 34:7); yea, "an innumerable company of angels" reside in this "heavenly Jerusalem,"
or "city of the living God," unto which we, as a part of the "general assembly and church of
the first-born," "are come" in this dispensation. Heb. 12:22, 23.

CHAPTER VI.

    And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as
    it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying,
    Come and see.

    2.

We have now reached the point where the thrilling interest of this book commences. With the
opening of the seals of the book of God's purposes we have the prophecies of the future, the
unfolding of the events to be, described under appropriate symbols. The contents of six seals
are contained in this and the following chapter, while the seventh occupies the remainder of
the volume.

A word relative to the plan of the prophecies will be appropriate at this time. I will again
state what will be made very clear hereafter--that the events are narrated by series, and not
by centuries. A particular theme is taken up and carried through to its completion, then the
narrative returns and another subject is traced to its end. Thus, the entire book consists
of a number of distinct parallel series covering the same ground.

Upon the opening of the first seal, John is summoned as with a voice of thunder by one of the
living creatures to draw near; and the object that meets his vision is a white horse with its
rider. The symbol is that of a victorious warrior, being drawn from the civil and military
life of the Romans. The symbol is one of dignity. It does not consist of some inanimate object
such as a mountain, a sea, or a river, neither is it a wild ferocious beast; but it is that
of a living, active, intelligent being, and he, as denoted by various insignia, a conqueror.
He rides a white horse, such as victors used in triumphal procession; his bow and crown are
also symbols of victory. He goes forth conquering and to conquer, or to make conquests.

This symbol is a faithful representation of the early triumphs of Christianity in its aggressive
conflict with the huge systems of error with which it had to contend. Some have supposed that
the rider represented Jesus Christ; but this can not be, for many reasons, two of which I will
give. First. Christ always appears on the symbolic stage in his own character, unrepresented
by another, for the reason, as before stated, that there is no creature that can analagously
represent Him who claims equality with God. Not one name or attribute peculiar to him is mentioned
in the description. Second. There are four horsemen brought to view in this chapter, and the
symbols all being drawn from the same department, must have the same general application. If
the first horseman symbolizes a definite personage, so do the remaining three; but we should
have great difficulty in identifying the last three, giving them an individual application.

Others make the first horseman a symbol of the gospel itself, but the gospel is not a living,
active, intelligent agent, such as the symbol evidently is, but is only a system of the revealed
truth. All congruity and appropriateness in the comparison is lacking.

But let us give this symbol further consideration. It is not enough that its interpretation
alone be given, but the reader is justly entitled to a knowledge of the process by which we
arrive at the truth. In the first place, we have a symbol of great dignity and excellence,
and we must look for an object of corresponding character. The symbol is that of a living agent,
and consequently, we must look for its fulfillment in an active, intelligent agent. The purity,
or whiteness, of the horse on which the rider was seated would indicate an agency of mild,
beneficent character. Finally, the symbol is drawn, as before stated, from the civil and military
life of the Romans. Now, according to the laws of symbolic language, a symbol never represents
an object like itself, but an analagous one in another department. A wild beast does not represent
a wild beast, but something of analagous character. Seven fat and seven lean kine do not represent
kine like themselves, but something analagous--seven years of plenty and as many of famine.
There are only two great series of events described in the Revelation--the history of ecclesiastical
events and the political history of certain nations. The present symbol is drawn from one of
these departments--the political or the civil life of the Romans; and leaving the latter department
to find its signification in another department, we have no place to go except into the department
of ecclesiastical affairs. Entering, therefore, the spiritual realm, and looking about us for
an object that perfectly meets every requirement of the symbol, we find it in the humble ministers
of Christ, who boldly went forth in obedience to the divine command to extend the peaceful
triumphs of the cross and to carry the gospel of the kingdom of God "into all the world." Mark
16:15-18; Mat. 28:19, 20. This succession of faithful, holy, devoted men is worthy of a place
in Apocalyptic vision. They went forth "conquering and to conquer"; and the victories they
gained were such as the world never witnessed before. Worthy are they to wear a victor's crown,
for they have "fought a good fight."

Because of its connection with events following, it is necessary for us to consider the divine
position of these first ministers of the church. Their equality is clearly taught in the New
Testament. Christ gave them the express command, "Be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master,
even Christ; and all ye are brethren." Mat. 23:8. But it shall not be so among you." Mat. 20:25,
26. Thus a perfect standard of equality in the ministry is lifted up. The beloved apostle,
the writer of the Revelation, when addressing the elders of the seven churches of Asia in particular,
humbly and affectionately represented himself as their "brother and companion in tribulation."
Rev. 1:9.

I will now adduce the testimony of several creditable historians, who are compelled to admit
the humble equality of the New Testament ministry, notwithstanding the fact that some of them
belonged to churches containing a very unequal ministry.

Mosheim says: "The rulers of the church were called their presbyters or bishops, which two
titles are, in the New Testament, undoubtedly applied to the same order of men.... Let no one
confound the bishops of this primitive and golden period of the church, with those of whom
we read in the following ages. For, though they were both distinguished by the same name, yet
they differed extremely, and that in many respects." Vol. I, p. 99.

This fact is now admitted by nearly all denominations, even Episcopalians. In the work entitled
"Episcopacy Tested by Scripture," published by the Protestant Episcopal Tract Society, New
York, the author, one of their able advocates, makes the following admission concerning the
title bishop in the New Testament, "that the name is there given to the middle order or presbyters;
and all that we read in the New Testament concerning bishops, including of course the words
overseer and oversight, which have the same derivation, is to be regarded as pertaining to
that middle grade"--the presbyters or elders. Page 12.

The noted historian Waddington, also an Episcopalian, makes the same admission in the following
words: "It is also true that in the earliest government of the first Christian society, that
of Jerusalem, not the elders only, but the 'whole church' were associated with the apostles;
and it is even certain that the terms bishop and elder or presbyter were, in the first instances,
and for a short period, sometimes used synomously, and indiscriminately applied to the same
order in the ministry." Church History, Part I, p. 41. The italicizing is mine.

The well-known historian Milman, also an Episcopalian, in his History of Christianity, says,
"The earliest Christian communities appear to have been ruled and represented, in the absence
of the apostle who was their first founder, by their elders, who are likewise called bishops,
or overseers of the church." Page 194.

Kurtz, in his Church History, says: "To aid them in their work, or to supply their places in
their absence (Acts 14:23), the apostles ordained rulers in every church, who bore the common
name of elders from their dignity, and of bishops from the nature of their office. That originally
the elders were the same as the bishops, we gather with absolute certainty from the statements
of the New Testament and of Clement of Rome, a disciple of the apostles. (See his first epistle
to the Corinthians, Chaps. 42, 44:52.) 1. The presbyters are expressly called bishops--compare
[the Greek especially] Acts 20:17 with verse 28, and Titus 1:5 with verse 7. 2. The office
of presbyter is described as next to and highest after that of apostle (Acts 15:6, 22). Similarly,
the elders are represented as those to whom alone the rule, the teaching and the care of the
church is entrusted (1 Tim. 5:17; 1 Pet. 5:1, etc.).... In [several] passages of the New Testament
and of Clement we read of many bishops in one and the same church. In the face of such indubitable
evidence, it is difficult to account for the pertinacity with which Romish and Anglican theologians
insist that these two offices had from the first been different in name and functions.... Even
Jerome, Augustine, Urban II. (1091) and Petrus Lombardus admit that originally the two had
been identical. It was reserved for the Council of Trent to convert this truth into a heresy."
Pages 67, 68. Chrysostom, Theodoret, and others also admitted the same.

Many similar historical testimonies now lying before me to the humble equality of the New Testament
ministry could be added; but lest the reader become weary, I will conclude with the following
beautiful description from D'Aubigne in his noted History of the Reformation: "The church was
in the beginning a community of brethren, guided by a few of the brethren." Again, "All Christians
were priests of the living God, with humble pastors as their guides." Vol. I, pp. 35, 50.

With this description of the early ministers of Christ, who went forth under the symbol of
the first horseman to disciple all nations, we have the events pertaining to the early history
of the church, laid before us; until the opening of the second seal brings us to another important
phase of its history.

    3. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second
    beast say, Come and see.

    4. And there went out another horse that was red: and power was
    given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and
    that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him
    a great sword.

The symbol of this seal is that of a rider going forth on a red horse armed with a great sword
with which to take peace from the earth and to kill. It is drawn from the same source as that
of the preceding one, but differing greatly in the character of the horseman and the object
of his mission. The symbol is one of great dignity--a living, intelligent agent--drawn from
civil and military life. For the same reason as given before, we must go out of the department
of civil life into the history of religious affairs to find its fulfilment.

Notice, also, the peculiar characteristics of this horseman and wherein he differs from that
of the first seal. The color of the horse is red, denoting something very different from the
peace, purity, and benignity of the white. Instead of gaining glorious spiritual conquests
and triumphs, like him of the first seal, he was to take peace from the earth. In the place
of a victor's crown, he possesses "a great sword" with which to kill, denoting an agent of
great destruction.

Where shall we look in the history of religious affairs to find the object that meets the requirements
of this symbol? Who were the active, intelligent agents that appeared as the great opposers
of the establishment of Christianity by the rider of the white horse? We find the answer undoubtedly
in the propagators of the Pagan religions. As soon as Christianity began to gain a foothold
in the Roman Empire, the priests and supporters of Paganism were exasperated to the last degree,
and they determined to crush out the Christian religion. An example of Pagan opposition is
found in the nineteenth chapter of Acts, where it is recorded that the preaching of the gospel
so stirred the people of Ephesus that they were filled with wrath and for the space of about
two hours cried out, saying, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" This great conflict between
Christianity and Paganism will be more fully described under other symbols in a subsequent
chapter, therefore I will make this description brief.

The destruction of life brought about by this rider of the red horse doubtless signifies the
great slaughter of the Christians at the hands of the Pagans. During ten seasons of severe
persecution, which occurred under the reigns of the emperors Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Marcus
Aurelius, Septimus Severus, Maximus, Decius, Gallus, Valerian, and Diocletian, the Christians
suffered every indignity that their relentless persecutors could heap upon them. They had their
eyes burned out with red-hot irons; they were dragged about with ropes until life was extinct;
they were beheaded, stoned to death, crucified, thrown to wild beasts, burned at the stake;
yet "they overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved
not their lives unto the death." Chap. 12:11.

It may appear at first that taking the rider of the horse as a symbolic agent but the killing
which he effected as literal, is an inconsistency and a variation from the laws of symbolic
language; but such is not necessarily the case. One principle laid down in the beginning was,
that the description of an object or event must necessarily be literal when no symbolic object
could be found to analagously represent it. The destruction of human life could not well be
represented symbolically, there being no destruction analagous to it whose meaning would be
obvious; hence it must appear as a literal description. This is proved by many texts in the
Revelation that will admit of no other application; such as verses 9-11 of this chapter; chapter
13:10; 17:6; etc.

But the literal destruction of life may be chosen as a symbol to represent a destruction to
which it is plainly analagous; such as the destruction of spiritual life, the overthrow of
the civil or ecclesiastical institutions of society, etc. That it is sometimes employed thus
as a symbol will be shown clearly in subsequent chapters. Hence, in every instance where killing
men is the work of a symbolic agent, the context, or general series of events with which it
is connected, must determine whether the literal or symbolical signification is intended. In
the present prophecy under consideration it is much more consistent to give it the literal
application; for the devotees of Paganism did not destroy the spiritual life of the church,
which would be an analagous killing; neither did they succeed in overthrowing the structure
of Christianity.

    5. And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third
    beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and
    he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

    6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A
    measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a
    penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

This symbol is also that of a horseman, differing from the preceding ones only in his characteristics.
He is seated upon a black horse, denoting something dark or appalling in its nature, the very
opposite of that of the first seal. He possesses no bow nor crown, but instead he has a pair
of balances in his hand for weighing food. This he deals out only at exorbitant prices--"a
measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny." The penny, or denarius,
is equal to about fifteen cents of our money, and was the ordinary wages of a day laborer.
In the parable of our Lord recorded in Mat. 20, the householder is represented as hiring laborers
for a penny a day to labor in his vineyard. The measure, or choenix, of wheat was the usual
daily allowance of food for a man. So according to the rate given, it would require a day's
labor to supply food sufficient for one man, which shows an enormous price placed upon these
necessaries of life. In ordinary times the penny would procure about twenty measures of wheat
instead of one, and fifty or sixty measures of barley instead of three. Surely this represents
famine prices.

The expression "see thou hurt not the oil and the wine" seems to have some direct connection
with the exorbitant schedule of food rates. The following facts of history, as recorded by
Lord, will serve to make the matter clear: "The taxes required in the Roman empire, to sustain
the court and civil service, the army and desolating wars, and the hungry brood of office-holders,
as well as to provide largesses to the soldiers, were excessive in the extreme, so as to prove
an almost insupportable burden to the people. The ordinary and economical expenses of the government
were great; but when we take into view that during a period of seventy-two years previous to
Diocletian, there were twenty-six individuals who held the imperial crown, besides a great
number of unsuccessful aspirants, and that each of these must secure the favor of the army
and the people by large donations of money, we may well conceive that the taxes and exactions
laid to raise the needed amount must have proved a crushing burden. They were so great as sometimes
to strip men of their wealth and reduce them to poverty. These were laid upon everything that
could be brought into service. Nothing was too insignificant to escape.... The taxes might
be paid in money, or in produce, grain, fruit, oil, or whatever else it might be;... The exactions
were so excessive that the people were led to avoid them in every possible mode, as men always
will under such circumstances." Once in fifteen years, a Roman indiction, an assessor would
go round to levy upon the products of the soil, and the assessment was made according to the
amount of the yield. One method adopted to secure a lower assessment at this time was that
of mutilating their fruit trees and vines. We find among the Roman laws severe enactments against
such as "feign poverty, or cut a vine, or stint the fruit of a tree" in order to avoid a fair
valuation, and the penalty attached was the death of the offender and the confiscation of all
his property. The fact that this law existed shows that the offense was committed and also
that the exactions of the government must have been of the most oppressive kind.

With these facts before us it is easy to discern the nature of the symbol, being that of a
Roman magistrate prepared to enforce his severe exactions upon the people at the exorbitant
rate of three measures of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny, accompanied
by the solemn injunction, "See thou hurt not the oil and the wine," that is, the olive-trees
and the vines.

It is evident that we must, as before, go out of the department of civil and military life
into the realm of ecclesiastical history to find the true fulfilment of this symbol. The black
color of the horse would denote something directly opposite to that of the first seal; and
since the symbol of the first seal represented the establishment of the pure gospel of Jesus
Christ, this symbol must represent the great apostasy and spiritual darkness that covered the
world at a later period. And if the horseman of the first seal represented the chosen ministry
who went forth in a glorious mission to win trophies of grace, the horseman of this seal must
represent an apostate ministry, possessing power and authority to enforce the severest exactions
upon the bread of life, thus producing a desolating spiritual famine. 

Thus it ought to be note, while in low-pitched LA, where the land is moist and much continue with the
pine, they can neither be truly bad nor highly ugly as in larger LA, where the marl is principal
masses, where there are the gallic hayfield, and where the light warms the world to a grade. The god
is as the circumference of one of our worst stirk, but he look instead
large, everything on history of his short fleece, which do them look
themselves to the oculus to much high-pitched than he was nevertheless
is.

The fleece is really short and white thin events, and is of color, as are similarly his bristly winds,
which are besides have curve, or besides short, that a wilderness of his cornet have rarely descend
over his opinion, and hinders him from understand before him; but his spreading of learn and smack is
thus exquisite as in step reservoir by the privation of the rugged points. A knot in wave on his
berm in the spot where they connect everything before cervix. His cornet are thin, little, and white;
and his foot is besides wet. The ox of this taxon have small bag for the maria. Much anoa is this
people of the person, and of the intensive thus for the clip past; the part is the agglomeration
on the cut, the sensation of which is thus same. They can run the
beast in most empire; for which mind they signify low-pitched LA,
and the stream upon Missisippi, as he anoa perforate there on etymology
of this heaviness of the vegetation; and too enjoy to food on retentive
eatage, which is only to be establish in the hayfield of the low farmstead.

 The manner in which this transformation was effected is explained
by the learned Gieseler as follows: "After the death of the apostles, and the pupils of the
apostles, to whom the general direction of the churches had always been conceded, some one
amongst the presbyters of each church was suffered gradually to take the lead in its affairs.
In the same irregular way the title of bishop was appropriated to the first presbyter." Eccl.
Hist., Vol. I, p. 65. In the days when the apostles were active in the affairs of the church
there were but two classes in the ministry--elders, or bishops, and deacons; but when one of
the presbyters was exalted to a higher position than the rest and assumed to himself the exclusive
use of the word bishop, there were three classes. To quote the words of Geo. P. Fisher: "After
we cross the limit of the first century we find that with each board of elders there is a person
to whom the name of bishop is specially applied, although, for a long time, he is likewise
often called a presbyter. In other words, in the room of a two-fold, we have a three-fold ministry."
Hist. of the Christian Church, p. 51.

The height to which the single bishop of authority in a church had been exalted is well illustrated
in the Ignatian Epistles. Ignatius was bishop of Antioch and was condemned by the emperor Trajan
to suffer death by being thrown to the wild beasts in the amphitheatre in Rome. His execution
in this manner took place Dec. 20, A.D. 107. He wrote a number of epistles, a few extracts
from which I will give. "Wherefore it is fitting that ye should run together in accordance
with the will of your bishop, which thing also ye do. For your justly renowned presbytery,
worthy of God, is fitted as exactly to the bishop as the strings are to the harp." To the Ephesians,
Chap. 4. "See that ye all follow the bishop, even as Jesus Christ does the Father.... Let no
man do anything connected with the church without the bishop." To the Smyrnaean's, Chap. 8.
"It is not lawful without the bishop either to baptize or to celebrate a love-feast; but whatsoever
he shall approve of, that is also pleasing to God." Smyrnaean's, Chap. 8. "It is well to reverence
both God and the bishop. He who honors the bishop has been honored of God; but he who does
anything without the knowledge of the bishop, does [in reality] serve the devil." Smyrnaean's,
Chap. 9.

The power of these bishops advanced steadily during the second century. The churches of the
cities where they were located extended themselves into the surrounding country and smaller
towns, and the presbyters or elders of these inferior churches were presided over by the bishop
of their mother church, and in this manner the great system of diocesan episcopacy was developed.[3]

[Footnote 3: The ancient signification of the term diocese must not be confounded with the
modern usage of the term. It then designated a territory or district, usually containing a
number of minor churches, presided over by one bishop.]

In the latter part of the second century when the disputes concerning Easter and Montanism
arose, the custom of diocesan bishops consulting with each other on important doctrines began,
and this developed in the third century into regular provincial synods, or councils. On account
of the ecclesiastical or political importance of the cities in which they were located, certain
bishops had a special deference given them, and they were not slow to take advantage of the
opportunity to exalt themselves to the presidency of these councils; and in a very short time
they possessed immense power and constituted entirely a separate order, designated by the term
metropolitan.

The manner in which this important step in the great apostasy was taken and the effects produced
thereby is well described in the words of the historian Mosheim (referring to events of the
third century), from whom I quote: "In process of time, all the Christian churches of a province
were formed into one large ecclesiastical body, which, like confederate states, assembled at
certain times, in order to deliberate about the common interests of the whole.... These councils
... changed the whole face of the church, and gave it a new form; for by them the ancient privileges
of the people were considerably diminished, and the power and authority of the bishops greatly
augmented.... At their first appearance in these general councils, they acknowledged that they
were no more than the delegates of their respective churches, and that they acted in the name,
and by the appointment of their people. But they soon changed this humble tone, imperceptibly
extended the limits of their authority, turned their influence into dominion, and their councils
into laws; and openly asserted, at length, that Christ had empowered them to prescribe to his
people, authoritative rules of faith and manners.... The order and decency of these assemblies
required that some one of the provincial bishops met in council, should be invested with a
superior degree of power and authority; and hence the rights of metropolitans derive their
origin."--Church History, Cent. II, Part 2.

When a usurping clergy grasps the power to prescribe "authoritative rules of faith and manners,"
to employ the words of Mosheim, we may well conceive that the true amount of pure spiritual
food was exceedingly small and could be procured only at starvation rates. He who reads the
ecclesiastical events of the third century will find it only too true that many of the cardinal
virtues of apostolic Christianity were almost lost sight of and that a great spiritual famine
existed in the earth over which this dark horseman of the third seal careered. Instead of salvation
through the Spirit of God being carefully taught, baptismal regeneration was exalted, and the
people were instructed in the saving virtues of the eucharist. The Platonic idea concerning
sin having its seat in the flesh was adopted, and therefore perfect victory or sanctification
was made to consist in the mortification of the natural appetites and desires of the body,
with the result that a life of fasting, celibacy, or self-inflicted torture was looked upon
as the surest means of obtaining the favor of Heaven. The writings of such eminent church Fathers
as Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian and others now lying before me, contain the surest evidences
of the woeful extent to which this dark cloud of superstition and error had settled down over
the world during the period of which I write.

    7. And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
    the fourth beast say, Come and see.

The usual interpretation given this horse and its rider is to apply it to the desolating wars
and famines that occurred in the Roman Empire. This view is embodied in the celebrated painting
"Death on the Pale Horse," in which death is represented as going forth with war, pestilence,
famine, and wild beasts, to ravage the Roman empire. We are informed by historians that dreadful
pestilences and famines did prevail and in some places nearly depopulated the country, and
that the remaining inhabitants could not make head against the beasts that multiplied in the
land. But the fact that such events occurred is not sufficient proof that this symbol has reference
to such. Famines and pestilences may have occurred many times without forming a part of the
Apocalyptic vision.

The greatest objection to giving this part of the vision such a literal interpretation is,
that it fails to bring out its symbolic character. To what, then, does it refer? We have, as
before, a horseman, indicating that the agent is one of the same general character, differing
mainly in his features and mission. This horse was of a livid, cadaverous hue, denoting an
agent of ghastly, terrible nature. The living rider bore the awful name of "Death," or as in
the original, "The Death," by way of emphasis. Death literally was not the agent--it is not
so stated--but the rider was termed The Death, or The Destroyer, because of his terrible mission;
and Hell followed with him.

Applying the laws of symbolic language as heretofore, it is evident that this symbol represents
a great persecuting ecclesiastical power. And with this thought before us, we can scarcely
fail to recognize it as a true description of the Papacy. The great apostasy, described under
the preceding seal, prepared the way for the final and complete establishment of the "man of
sin"; but during the period there brought to view the ministers of religion, power-seeking
and apostate as they were, were unable to enforce their claims by the power of persecution.
Under the present seal, however, is represented a later stage of their corruption, when a great
hierarchal system, sustained and upheld by the arm of civil power, was able to bear tyrannical
rule over a great portion of the earth. During this period clerical ambition and usurpation
reached its greatest height.

After speaking of the power possessed by the metropolitans, Mosheim says: "The universal church
had now the appearance of one vast republic, formed by a combination of a great number of little
states. This occasioned the creation of a new order of ecclesiastics, who were appointed in
different parts of the world, as heads of the church, and whose office it was to preserve the
consistence and union of that immense body, whose members were so widely dispersed throughout
the nations. Such was the nature and office of the Patriarchs." Church History, Cent. II, part 2.

Thus, the bishops, or metropolitans, of certain of the most important cities were exalted to
a still higher position as special heads of the church. They were termed Exarchs at first,
after the title of the provincial governors, but afterwards received the more ecclesiastical
appellation Patriarchs. The term Patriarch had been in use for a long time in the church signifying
merely a bishop, irrespective of the dignity he possessed, but it was finally limited to this
higher class of the clergy, in which sense I now employ it. The cities that first enjoyed this
chief distinction were Alexandria, Rome, and Antioch. The general council of Nice (A.D. 325)
in its sixth canon recognized the superior authority already possessed by these cities. See
D'Aubigne's Hist, of Reformation, Vol. I, p. 41. The general council of Constantinople in its
third canon placed the bishop of Constantinople in the same rank with the other three Patriarchs;
and the general council of Calcedon exalted the See of Jerusalem to a similar dignity, doubtless
because of its ancient importance as the birthplace of Christianity. Thus, Patriarchs were
established in the five political capitals of the Roman empire; and they were considered the
"heads of the church," having spiritual authority over the whole empire. These were the only
Patriarchates of importance. Certain ecclesiastics of the Church of Rome even at the present
time bear the honorary title Patriarch; but, to quote the words of the Encyclopædia Britannica,
"In a strictly technical sense, however, that church recognizes only five Patriarchates, those
of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and Rome." Art. Patriarch. In the years
637 to 640 Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch fell into the hands of the Saracen followers
of Mohammed, which terminated their importance, and later the Greek schism separated the Patriarch
of Constantinople from Rome; and thus the Patriarch of Rome was left in undisputed possession
of the field and was soon recognized as universal head of the church. So under the symbol of
this dread rider on a pale horse is portrayed the great hierarchal system by which the Papacy
was fully developed in the West.

It is fitting that we notice particularly the agents of destruction employed by this rider.
He possesses a sword with which to kill--the same instrument wielded by the rider of the red
horse--but it is evident that he uses it with more terrific energy, by reason of which he receives
the name Death, or The Destroyer. It is possible, also, that in this case a sword, wielded
by the hand of an ecclesiastical power, may be used as a symbol of a spiritual cutting off,
or excommunication. The sword of excommunication has been the most terrible ever wielded by
human hand. When this pale horseman was careering over the world in the zenith of his power,
excommunication and interdiction were the terror of individuals and the scourge of nations.
At his word the rights of an individual as king, ruler, husband or father, nay, even as a man,
were forfeited, and he was shunned like one infected with the leprosy. At his command the offices
of religion were suspended in a nation, and its dead lay unburied, until its proud ruler humbled
himself at the feet of the ecclesiastical tyrant who bore rule over the "fourth part of the
earth."[4]

[Footnote 4: This tyranny of the Popes is well illustrated by the quarrel that took place between
Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII.) and Henry IV. of Germany. Gregory attempted to make certain
reforms, but Henry refused to recognize those innovations. Gregory excommunicated the emperor,
with the result that he was "shunned as a man accursed by Heaven." His authority lost and his
kingdom on the point of going to pieces, Henry had but one thing to do--seek the pardon of
the Pope. He found the Pontiff at Canoosa, but Gregory refused to admit the penitent to his
presence. "It was winter, and for three successive days the king, clothed in sackcloth, stood
with bare feet in the snow of the court-yard of the palace, waiting for permission to kneel
at the feet of the Pontiff and to receive forgiveness." On the fourth day he was granted admittance
to the presence of the Pope.

During the Pontificate of Innocent III. Philip Augustus, king of France, put away his wife.
Innocent commanded him to take her back and forced submission by means of an interdict. This
submission of a brave, firm, and victorious prince shows the tremendous power wielded by the
Popes in that period.

The manner, also, in which Innocent III. humbled King John of England affords another illustration
of the power of the Popes. John caused the vacant See of Canterbury to be filled, in accordance
with the regular manner of election, by one of his favorites. Innocent declared the appointment
void, as he desired that the place should be filled by one of his friends. John refused to
allow the Pope's archbishop to enter England as Primate. Innocent then excommunicated John,
laid all England under an interdict, and incited Philip, king of France, to war, offering him
John's kingdom upon the very liberal condition that he go over and take it. The outcome of
the matter was that John was compelled to yield to the power of the Pope. He even gave him
England as a perpetual fief, and agreed to pay the Papal See the annual sum of one thousand marks.]

The loss of life by spiritual famine was extreme. The Word of God, which is spirit and life
to God's people (Jno. 6:63), was laid under interdict and the common people deprived of its
benefits. At the time the black horse appeared, a little food could be obtained at famine prices;
but when the fourth arrived, he was empowered to kill "with hunger." Also, one of his agents
of destruction was death, or pestilence, a fit symbol of false and blasphemous doctrines breathed
forth like a deadly pestilence blasting everything within its reach. Invocation of saints,
worship of images, relics, celibacy, works of supererogation, indulgences, and purgatory--these
were the enforced principles of religion, and like a pest they settled down upon the people
everywhere.

This rider also brought into operation "the beasts of the earth" to aid him in his destructive
work. To kill with sword or hunger shows that such work of destruction is performed solely
by him who has it in his power; but to kill with beasts indicates that they perform the deadly
work according to their own natures. Nothing is clearer than the fact that wild beasts stand
as a symbol of persecuting tyrannical governments; hence we are to understand that this rider
was to employ also the arm of civil power to aid him in the deadly work. How strikingly this
represents the historical facts of the case! In all truly Roman Catholic countries the civil
governments were only a cipher or tool in the hands of the church, and the ecclesiastics were
the real rulers of the kingdom. But whenever any dark work of persecution was to be performed,
the wild beast was let loose to accomplish the result. When charged, however, with the bloody
work, the Catholics always answer, "Oh, we never persecute--don't you see, it is the wild beasts
that are covered with gore--our hands are clean," yet they themselves held the chain that bound
the savage monsters. We shall have occasion in a subsequent chapter to trace further the pathway
of this dread rider as he reels onward in the career of ages, "drunken with the blood of the
saints."

This work of destruction performed by the dread rider on the pale horse is considered by many
as a literal description of the persecutions of the Papacy. While Catholics usually charge
the civil powers with this bloody work, it is an undeniable fact of history that the Popes
often ordered or sanctioned crusades against the Waldenses, Albigenses, and other peoples (see
remarks on verses 9-11, chap. 17:6), in which the sword, starvation, and every other means
of cruelty imaginable were brought into use to exterminate the so-called heresy. And in view
of the fact explained in the comments on verses 3 and 4 of this chapter, that killing is sometimes
to be understood in a literal sense on account of there being nothing to analagously represent
such destruction of life, it is not a violation of the laws of symbolic language thus to interpret
it. It might be consistent in this case to give it a twofold application; the agreeing facts
of history regarding the Papacy strongly suggest it. Thus, the sword could signify a literal
destruction of life, as in verse 4, and also, in the present case, an ecclesiastical cutting
off by the Papacy, or excommunication; and hunger could signify literal death by starvation,
and also, as in verses 5 and 6, a destruction of spiritual life, etc.

Where, let me ask, in the whole compass of human writings can be found a series of events of
such thrilling interest, so great in magnitude, as is contained in these eight verses? Who
but the Omnipotent could have conceived such a wonderful development of the power of iniquity
and with such master-strokes of power compressed them into so small a scene of symbolic imagery?
The impress of divinity is here speaking from every line.

    9.

    11. And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it
    was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little
    season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that
    should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

Upon the opening of this seal the scene changes entirely. No more horsemen appear, but instead
the souls of the martyrs are seen at the altar crying for vindication of their blood upon the
cruel oppressors of earth. The question arises, Are these souls symbols of something else,
or are they what they are here stated to be, "the souls of them that were slain"? Evidently,
the latter, appearing under their own name and character, because they can not properly be
symbolized. They were disembodied spirits, and where is there anything of analagous character
to represent such? Angels can not; for whenever they are employed as symbols, it is to designate
distinguished agencies among men. They therefore appear under their own appropriate title as
"the souls of them that were slain."

These souls appeared "under the altar," that is, at the foot of the altar, being the same as
that described in chap. Thus, the heavenly world, as opened up before John, appeared symbolized
after the sanctuary of the temple in which stood the golden altar, or altar of incense. Some
have supposed that the brazen altar was the one referred to, signifying the living sacrifice
these souls made of themselves to God. But there is no altar mentioned in the symbols except
the golden altar. Besides, these were not sacrificial victims; for Christ was made a complete
sacrifice for sin, while these only suffered martyrdom because of their faithfulness to the
cause of Christ. It is much more reasonable to suppose that their interceding cries went up
from the golden altar, where the "prayers of all saints" ascended with much incense.

Their prayers to God for the avenging of their blood shows the expectation on their part that
the judgments of Heaven would descend upon the cruel and haughty persecutors and oppressors
of earth, and their surprise was that the day of retribution had been so long delayed. The
history of the church as developed under the preceding seals gives particular force to this
cry of the martyrs. For nearly three centuries the civil power of Pagan Rome had been employed
to crush the cause of God. During ten terrible seasons of persecution they had been crucified,
slain with the sword, sawn asunder, devoured by beasts in the arena, and given to the flames.
When Constantine, a nominal Christian emperor, ascended the throne and protected religion by
law, it was believed that persecutions must cease; but soon the discovery was made that the
sword had only changed hands, there having risen an ecclesiastical hierarchy destined to "glut
itself upon the blood of which heathen Rome had only tasted." The world was now made the arena
for the terrible coursings of the pale horseman, and the "beasts of the earth" were let loose
to fall with savage fury upon their helpless victims, until millions lost their lives at the
instigation of the apostate Church of Rome. Is it any wonder that the souls of these martyrs
should cry unto God for the vindication of their righteous blood?

It is said that "white robes were given unto every one of them." By referring to chap. 3:4;
7:9, 13, 14, it will be seen that "white garments" and "white robes" are sometimes used as
a symbol to describe a part of the heavenly inheritance. The martyr-spirits, although impatient
at the delay of avenging judgment, received a righteous reward. But the period of tribulation
to the church was not yet over. The cup of iniquity in the hands of her enemies was not yet
full, and they were told to "rest for a little season, until their fellowservants also, and
their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled." The account given
seems to indicate an important epoch, a period in which the martyrs had reason to expect the
vindication of their righteous blood, but which, instead, was to be followed by another great
period of persecution. Considering the time of the events already described in this series
of prophecy, we have no difficulty in fixing the chronology of this event at the dividing-point
between the era of Papal supremacy and the age of Protestantism--or at the Reformation of the
Sixteenth Century. Did severe slaughter and persecution follow the Reformation? Witness the
reign of Mary Tudor, frequently styled "Bloody Mary." During three years of her reign, 1555
to 1558, two hundred and eighty-eight were burnt alive in England! Think of the inhuman massacre
of the innocent Waldenses of southern France by the violent bigot Oppede (1545), who slew eight
hundred men in one town, and thrust the women into a barn filled with straw and reduced the
whole to ashes--only a sample of his barbarity; or of their oppression in southern Italy by
Pope Pius IV. (1560), at whose command they were slain by thousands, the throats of eighty-eight
men being cut on one occasion by a single executioner! Witness the horrible massacre of St.
Bartholomew in Paris (Aug. 21, 1572), when the Queen dowager, the infamous Catherine de Medici,
lured immense numbers of the innocent Hugenots into the city under the pretext of witnessing
a marriage between the Hugenot Henry, king of Navarre, and the sister of Charles IX., king
of France--when the gates were closed and the work of wholesale slaughter began at a given
signal and raged for three days, during which time from six to ten thousand were butchered
in Paris alone! Think of the rivers of blood in the Netherlands, where the Duke of Alva boasted
that in the short space of six weeks he had put eighteen thousand to death! Witness the dragoonading
methods and other inhuman persecutions to "wear out the saints of the Most High," that followed
the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) by Louis XIV., king of France, during whose reign
three hundred thousand were brutally butchered--while Pope Innocent XI. extolled the king by
special letter as follows: "The Catholic church shall most assuredly record in her sacred annals
a work of such devotion toward her, and CELEBRATE YOUR NAME WITH NEVER-DYING PRAISES ... for
this most excellent undertaking"!! My heart sickens with horror in the contemplation of such
events. Eternal God! can thy righteous eye behold such heart-rending scenes of earth, and thy
hand of power not be extended to humble to the dust these cruel, haughty oppressors of thy people?

    12.

    14.

Upon the opening of this seal the scene changes again. The symbols are all drawn from an entirely
different source. We are taken out of the department of civil life into the scenes of nature,
which is a clear evidence that the history of the church is no longer under consideration.
Had God intended to here continue her history, he would no doubt have employed symbols derived
from the same source as those preceding, so as to prevent our being led astray. No more horsemen
or living characters appear, but we behold the most terrific convulsions of nature--a mighty
earthquake, the darkening of the sun and the moon, the falling of the stars, and finally the
dissolution of the heavens, together with the mountains and the islands being removed. If the
history of the church is no longer under consideration, this great change of symbols directs
us with absolute certainty into the political and civil world for their fulfilment. Of course,
we are not to suppose that this is a literal description.

In this manner the dignity and the excellence in the use and the interpretation of symbols
is preserved. To describe the religious history of the church, noble symbols chosen from the
department of human life are selected; while symbols drawn from an inferior department--that
of nature--are chosen to represent political affairs. This point will appear very clear as
we proceed in the interpretation of the Apocalypse. It is just what we might naturally expect.

The question may be asked, If these symbols from nature represent political affairs, where
in the events of civil history shall we look for their fulfilment? Every one will readily perceive
the analogy between an earthquake and a political revolution, when all society is in a state
of agitation as when the solid earth trembles. It is also evident that the sun, moon, and stars
bear the same analagous relationship to the earth that kings, rulers, and princes do to the
body politic; while the firmament of heaven is analagous to the entire fabric of civil government,
the symbolic heaven in which the symbolic orbs are set to give light.

The symbols, then, point us to the most terrible revolutions--when society is in a state of
agitation, when kingdoms are overthrown and their rulers and princes thrown from their positions
or made objects of the most gloomy terror; yea, when the entire fabric of civil government
is finally overthrown and all the institutions and organizations of society are swept away
as with a tornado. A large portion of the Apocalypse is occupied with the history of these
persecuting powers, civil and ecclesiastical. It is their dominacy that constitutes the long
period of tribulation to the church, when the witnesses prophesy in sackcloth and the faithful
are ground into the dust by the feet of these proud oppressors as they stand in the high places
of the earth. But the cries of the slaughtered saints have ascended to the throne as incense;
God speaks; the judgments of Heaven descend upon these lofty ones; and a voice from heaven
declares, "They have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood
to drink; for they are worthy."

This is surely a striking combination of symbols, and the way they are arranged would indicate
that their fulfilment occupied a considerable period of time. This description covers the same
period as that described under the seven last plagues, beginning with certain fearful revolutions
in which the nations that had slaughtered the millions of God's people were given "blood to
drink," and ending finally in "the great day of his wrath" that shall sweep them from their
positions eternally. The full explanation of these events can not at present be appreciated
by the reader, therefore I reserve it for the future, to be more fully developed under other
symbols.

In these six seals we have a vivid outline of mighty events, political and ecclesiastical,
extending from the earliest stage of Christianity to the end of time. This description in advance
was no mere human production. No human foresight would have detected, and no mortal mind would
have conceived, events so wonderful and so farreaching in their character. Any other history
would sooner have been imagined. It takes divine wisdom to understand the true position of
the church in the present, and she can scarcely read her past history by natural wisdom alone,
much less outline the future. First the establishment of Christianity is symbolized, then the
violence of the Pagan party, the apostasy, and final establishment of the "man of sin," until
the millions of earth are crushed by the spiritual tyranny or by the arm of civil power, and
the cry of the martyrs goes up "How long, O Lord?" But they are told to rest "a little season,"
when they shall witness the hand of God laid upon these persecuting nations of earth, convulsing
them in the most fearful revolutions, and ending finally in their complete overthrow in that
last "great day of God Almighty."

CHAPTER VII.

    3. Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
    till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.

    4. And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there
    were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the
    tribes of the children of Israel.

    5. Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
    tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad
    were sealed twelve thousand.

    6. Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
    tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
    Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.

    7. Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
    tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
    Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

    8. Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand.

A clear understanding of the two visions in the chapter before us can be obtained only by considering
the plan of the prophecy already referred to. The events are narrated by series. A particular
theme is taken up and followed through to its completion; then the narrative returns and another
theme is introduced. But this is not all. Whenever the history of abounding error or iniquity
is set forth, we have in immediate connection and in perfect contrast therewith a history of
the true people of God; thus, the contemporaneous history of righteousness and iniquity, truth
and error, a true church and a false one. The visions of this chapter cover the same period
of time as the events described in the preceding chapter, but form the most perfect contrast.
The student of Revelation who unfolds the dark history of apostasy and iniquity contained in
the preceding seals might naturally be led to ask, Is this the melancholy end of God's church?
Does it deteriorate rapidly and turn out so badly, after all? As an answer to these questions,
God gives us next a history of his own people, showing that he preserved his own church complete,
although Antichrist reigned in power.

became a drug in the slave-markets of the world, and were so numerous that in many places they
outnumbered the Roman citizens ten to one. In the first century before Christ it is said that
some Sicilian estates were worked by as many as twenty thousand slaves. "That each owner might
know his own, the poor creatures were branded like cattle." The "mark of the beast" possessed
by the followers of a false communion will be found to consist of an Antichristian spirit by
which they are filled with "doctrines of devils." So, also, "the seal of the living God" consists
of the giving of the Holy Spirit, by which his people are led into all truth. See John 14:26.
While Sabbatarians vainly try to prove that keeping the seventh day is the seal of God in this
dispensation, yet there is not one text of Scripture that hints such a thing, but, on the contrary,
the Scriptures are against them. Eph. 4:30. Again, the Word of God says, "Now he which stablished
us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us is God; who hath also sealed us, and given the
earnest of the Spirit in our hearts." 2 Cor. 1:21, 22. The winds of heaven were restrained
until the work of full salvation could be firmly established in the earth. When Christ appeared,
the Roman empire was in a state of comparative quiet, and the immense hosts of foreign invaders
did not appear until the firm establishment of Christianity, being held back by the power of
God until his work should be accomplished.

In the description of the sealing given, twelve thousand were selected from each of the twelve
tribes. Some have supposed this to have reference solely to salvation work among the Jewish
nation; but that would be adopting the literal mode of interpretation, thus destroying its
symbolic character. The twelve tribes are chosen from the proper department to represent the
church or "Israel of God" in this dispensation, irrespective of nationality. The twelve gates
in the wall of the heavenly city are named after the twelve tribes of the children of Israel
(chap. 21:12), showing that it is only through "Israel" that any one can enter the New Jerusalem.
Since the gospel is given to all nations, this can not signify literal Israel. "The children
of the promise are counted for the seed." Rom. 9:8. Since the vision is symbolical, we are
to consider the numbers given as symbolical also, the definite number of twelve thousand from
each of the tribes showing that the church of God was complete and perfect, no part being omitted.

    9.

    11.

    14. And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest.

    15.

    16. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
    shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

    17. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
    them, and shall lead them unto living mountains of waters: and
    God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

In this scene the vision is carried forward to the close of the long period of tribulation
and persecution to the church of God, when all her enemies are finally overthrown; and here
are the glorious results, the harvest gathered: a great multitude whom no man can number, gathered
out of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and
before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands, the symbols of their victory.
The scene is laid in heaven, and refers undoubtedly to the end of time when the heavenly world
will be opened up to all the faithful who have suffered for Christ amid the trials and the
oppositions through which his church is called to pass in this present world. We are expressly
informed by one of the elders who these are in white robes and whence they came, so there can
be no question respecting them. They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
shall the sun light on them, nor any heat." What a contrast with the scenes of earth, when
oppressed by famine, and cold, and nakedness, and peril, and sword, they were killed all the
day long!

It is clear that, in this chapter and the one preceding, we have two grand parallel and comprehensive
histories--in one, the process of corruption in the so-called church and the final judgments
that overtook these cruel persecutors of the Lord's people; in the other, the setting apart
and sealing of God's servants, their preservation from the contaminations of an apostate church,
and the final glorious triumph of all who endure unto the end.

This vision has often been applied in a figurative manner to the spiritual reign of God's people
on earth before the end of time--that they are overcomers through the blood of Christ, that
God dwells with them in his church, that their spiritual needs are all supplied so they hunger
and thirst no more--but a careful study of the plan of the prophecy will show that its real
signification is the heavenly state at the end. As the sixth seal describes the final overthrow
of all the antichristian powers that have oppressed God's people on earth; so this vision describes
the great white-robed company gathered out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, who
have been preserved faithful through all these trials and tribulations, and who receive at
last the crown of everlasting life. This last vision will be more fully described under certain
symbols contained in the last two chapters of this book; while the earthquake, the falling
of the stars, etc., of the sixth seal will be more perfectly detailed in chapters 15 and 16.

CHAPTER VIII.

    And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
    heaven about the space of half an hour.

    2.

The remainder of the book is embraced in the contents of the seventh seal. This may appear
a little singular at first, being so much larger than the preceding ones. But it is easily
understood when we consider the six as being a synopsis of the whole book, containing a history
of the church apostate to the final consummation, and also the contemporaneous history of the
truth church of God; while the seventh gives in detail the account of these great persecuting
powers, civil and ecclesiastical, and the trials and triumphs of the saints in the New Jerusalem--developing
more fully the events described under the six.

Upon the opening of the seventh seal, "there was silence in heaven about the space of half
an hour." Whether this interval of silence is intended to be symbolical of any event on earth
I do not know; neither have I seen any solution of the matter that is consistent or satisfactory.
Some have supposed that it denoted a cessation of persecution among the Christians of earth.
But if that were the case, then its opposite, "voices in heaven," would indicate seasons of
persecution. There were several seasons of rest from persecution enjoyed by the early saints,
and why should one period be singled out more than the rest and be thus described? Besides,
"a half hour," according to prophetic time would signify only about one week, a period too
short certainly to take account of. Others have supposed that it signified the end of the world,
and that heaven would then be deserted for a short time while the judgment was taking place.
But the events following show that the end of the world is not here described, therefore it
can not have reference to such. Moreover, it is extremely doubtful whether silence in heaven
would be a proper symbol of such an event. I do not perceive the analogy. In fact, such an
interpretation of silence would be literal and not symbolic.

Its explanation would seem to be found in connection with certain facts stated respecting the
opening of the preceding seals--that voices followed them. When the first four seals were opened,
John heard the voices of the four beasts, "as it were a voice of thunder"; and on the opening
of the fifth, he heard the souls of the martyrs crying unto God; but when the seventh was opened,
there was silence for a time. The contrast is noticeable; but whether it has any special signification,
I am unable to say; perhaps not.

Before the sounding of the seven trumpets, the acceptableness of the prayers of the saints
is represented by an angel offering incense "upon the golden altar which was before the throne."
This scene was doubtless introduced to lend encouragement to God's children--that, although
iniquity abounded on every side and the judgments of God were poured out upon the people, still
the prayers of the faithful few were acceptable in his sight, ascending before the throne like
sweet incense from off the golden altar.

After offering up the incense with the prayers of all saints, the same angel took his censer
and filled it with fire from off the altar and cast it (the fire) upon the earth--a token of
God's avenging judgments--"and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake."
These, of course, were on earth, and symbolized the revolutions and convulsions now about to
take place in the empire.

    6. And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
    themselves to sound.

    7. The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire
    mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the
    third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt
    up.

We here enter upon a series of prophecies developing fully the successive steps in the decline
of the Western Roman empire, by which it finally tottered to its fall. It was necessary that
this persecuting, tyrannical government should be subverted in order to give opportunity for
the establishment of apostate Christianity in the form of the Papacy, as it constituted the
"let" or hindrance to the full development of the "man of sin" mentioned by the apostle in
2 Thes. 2. That persecuting, Pagan Rome was a serious obstacle confronting the development
of apostasy was recognized even by the early Christians. Thus, Tertullian, in his notable Apology,
chapter 32, says: "Christians are under a particular necessity of praying for the emperors,
and for the continued state of the empire; because we know that dreadful power which hangs
over the world, and the conclusion of the age, which threatens the most horrible evils, is
restrained by the continuance of the time appointed for the Roman empire. This is what we would
not experience; and while we pray that it may be deferred, we hereby show our good-will to
the perpetuity of the Roman state." In a subsequent chapter it will be seen that Pagan Rome,
broken up into minor divisions and no longer able to maintain her position in the political
world, resigns her power and authority into the hands of the rising Papacy. Therefore it is
not surprising that the means by which this great change is effected should be made the subject
of prophetic revelation. Besides, we have other things to guide us in the interpretation. We
can readily identify the symbols under the fifth trumpet with the curse of Mohammedanism in
the Eastern empire, and we would naturally suppose that the first four precede those. Again,
the symbols are all drawn from the natural world, which leads us assuredly into the political
affairs of the empire for their fulfilment. They are also of the most destructive nature, therefore
we look for objects of a corresponding desolating character. Finally, the vision of the preceding
chapter represents fierce, destructive winds as about to descend upon the earth, being temporarily
held in check to give opportunity for the primitive establishment of Christianity, implying
that they would afterwards be let loose to burst like a tornado upon the empire. It is said
positively that power was given "to hurt the earth and the sea" (chap. 7:2), and in the vision
before us the effects produced upon the earth and the trees are particularly detailed.

"The earth" signifies the Roman empire, or that portion of the earth made the subject of apocalyptic
vision. That this application of the word earth is correct, is shown by various Scriptures.
"And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Cæsar Augustus that all
the world should be taxed." Luke 2:1. "The queen of the South ... came from the uttermost parts
of the earth [southern Arabia] to hear the wisdom of Solomon." Mat. 12:42. "Ye shall be witnesses
... unto the uttermost part of the earth." Acts 1:8. The apostles carried the gospel personally,
only throughout the territory of the then-known civilized world--the Roman empire. Upon this
earth there descended in the vision before us a fierce storm of hail and fire, mingled with
blood. Its being mingled with blood would indicate its destructive effects. One characteristic
of this symbol particularly is worthy of notice. Hail and fire cast upon the earth would become
absorbed speedily or pass into new combinations with the surrounding elements, thus not remaining
in any permanent form except in its effects. In this particular it is wholly unlike the symbol
of the next trumpet, which is that of a burning mountain cast into the sea, for such a body
would naturally remain permanently where it fell; whereas a storm of hail and fire would soon
disappear. Also, the statement that this storm was cast upon the earth would indicate that
it was a calamity descending from without upon the empire.

Where, now, do we find the object that fully meets the requirements of this symbol--destructive
agents descending upon the Roman empire like a furious storm of hail and fire, accomplishing
the first important step toward the subverting of the empire? We find it in the irruption of
the fierce Gothic tribes of the North, who, under Alaric, burst like a tornado upon the empire
about the beginning of the fifth century, spreading destruction and desolation upon every side.

The following quotations and facts from the highest authority on the subject, Gibbon's Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire (Vol. III, pp. 190-294), will give the reader an idea of the awful
effects produced by the invasions of these barbarous tribes. The great Theodosius, emperor
of the Western Roman empire, "had supported the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic,"
but upon his death he was succeeded by the weak Honorious. In a few months the Gothic barbarians
were in arms. "The barriers of the Danube were thrown down, the savage warriors of Scythia
issued from their forests ... and the various tribes of barbarians, who glory in the Gothic
name, were irregularly spread over the woody shores of Dalmatia to the walls of Constantinople."
They were "directed by the bold and artful genius of Alaric," who soon concluded that the conquest
of Constantinople was an impracticable enterprise. He "disdained to trample any longer on the
prostrate and ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a plentiful harvest
of fame and riches in a province which had hitherto escaped the ravages of war.... The troops
which had been posted to defend the straits of Thermopylæ retired ... without attempting to
disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric; and the fertile fields of Phocis and Bæotia
were instantly covered by a deluge of barbarians, who massacred the males of an age to bear
arms, and drove away the beautiful females, with the spoil and cattle of the flaming villages.
The travelers who visited Greece several years afterwards, could easily discover the deep and
bloody traces of the march of the Goths.... The whole territory of Attica, from the promontory
of Sunium to the town of Megara, was blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the
comparison of a contemporary philosopher, Athens itself resembled the bleeding and empty skin
of a slaughtered victim.... Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded without resistance to the arms
of the Goths; and the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by death, from beholding
the slavery of their families and the conflagration of their cities."

Arcadius, the emperor of the East, wishing to dissuade Alaric from further conquests and such
wholesale massacres, promoted him to the rank of Master-general of the eastern Illyricum, but
it had an opposite effect. "The birth of Alaric, the glory of his past exploits, and the confidence
in his future designs, insensibly united the body of the [Gothic] nation under his victorious
standard; and, with the unanimous consent of the barbarian chieftains, the Master-general of
Illyricum was elevated, according to the ancient custom, on a shield, and solemnly proclaimed
king of the Visigoths. Armed with this double power, situated on the verge of the two empires,
he alternately sold his deceitful promises to the courts of Arcadius and Honorious; until he
declared and executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the West.... He was tempted
by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of Italy, which he had twice visited; and he secretly aspired
to plant the Gothic standard on the walls of Rome, and to enrich his army with the accumulated
spoils of three hundred triumphs." He marched into Italy, and the emperor fled before him.
A temporary respite was finally procured by the promise of a payment of four thousand pounds
of gold.

Alaric soon appeared, however, before the very walls of Rome, and that splendid city, surrounded
by hordes of barbarians, was soon reduced to a wretched condition by famine. Two representatives
of the Romans waited upon Alaric for terms of peace, stating that if such could not be arranged
the inhabitants of the city, animated by despair, would fight to the bitter end. To this the
haughty conqueror made this famous reply: "The thicker the grass, the easier it is mowed."
With an insulting laugh, he named the ransom required--all the gold and silver contained in
the city, all the rich and precious movables, together with all the slaves. Then the ministers
humbly asked, "What do you intend to leave us?" "Your lives," the haughty king replied, and
retired. He finally relaxed a little and fixed other terms, which included the immediate payment
of the enormous sum of five thousand pounds of gold, thirty thousand pounds of silver, besides
other treasure. "The victorious leader, who united the daring spirit of a barbarian with the
art and discipline of a Roman general, was at the head of a hundred thousand fighting men;
and Italy pronounced, with terror and respect, the formidable name of Alaric."

A second time Rome was besieged by Alaric and taken. Honorious was deposed and Attalus made
emperor; but Honorious was afterwards restored. In A.D. 410 he again marched upon the city,
captured and entered it. "Eleven hundred and sixty-three years after the foundation of Rome,
the imperial city, which had subdued and civilized so considerable a part of mankind, was delivered
to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germania and Scythia." For six days the city was sacked
by the barbarous soldiery, and the horrible scenes of robbery, murder, and rapine that ensued
can not be described. It has been said that "civilized warfare is sufficiently terrible," but
that would be almost a blessing compared with such scenes as these. For a space of four years
Alaric ravaged Italy almost without opposition.

The slaughter and devastation that followed this storm of "hail and fire" is thus described:
"The banks of the Rhine were crowned like those of the Tiber, with houses and well-cultivated
farms; and if a poet descended the river, he might express his doubts on which side was situated
the territory of the Romans. This scene of peace and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert,
and the prospect of the smoking ruins could alone distinguish the solitude of nature from the
desolation of man. The flourishing city of Mentz was surprised and destroyed, and many thousand
Christians inhumanly massacred in the church. Wurms perished after a long and obstinate siege.
Strasburg, Spires, Rheims, Tournay, Arras, Amiens, experienced the cruel oppression of the
German yoke, and the consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the Rhine over the greatest
part of the seventeen provinces of Gaul. That rich and extensive country, as far as the ocean,
the Alps and the Pyrenees, was delivered to the barbarians, who drove before them, in a promiscuous
crowd, the bishop, the senator and the virgin, laden with the spoils of their houses and altars."

Another historian describing the same, a few years after the event, says: "The barbarians meeting
with little resistance, indulged in the utmost cruelty. The cities which they captured, they
so utterly destroyed that no traces of them now remain, except in Thrace and Greece, except
here and there a tower or a gate. All the men who opposed them they slew, young and old, and
indeed spared not women, nor even children. Whence there is still but a sparse population in
Italy. The plunder which they seized in every part of Europe was immense, and especially at
Rome, where they left nothing, either public or private." In this latter description reference
is also made to some later invasions, but they were all of the same desolating character.

These historical facts show how the green grass, or the feebler portion of society--the tender
sex, the young, and the aged--were consumed before this fearful storm of hail and fire; and
also how the trees, or the stronger portion--those better able to make resistance--suffered
greatly.

It is also a fact to be observed that these fierce tribes which overran Italy, harassed or
captured Rome repeatedly, and threatened the overthrow of the empire, made no permanent settlement
in that territory. "Under Alaric the Goths make no lasting settlement. In the long tale of
intrigue and warfare between the Goths and the two Imperial courts which fills up this whole
time, cessions of territory are offered to the Goths, provinces are occupied by them, but as
yet they do not take root anywhere; no Western land as yet becomes Gothia,"--Encyclopædia Britannica,
Art. Goths. After the death of Alaric (A.D. 412), however, they settled in the southern part
of Spain and Gaul[5]--part of the territory of the West--but they no longer threatened the
life of the empire; but, on the contrary, they became allies of the Romans in opposing the
dreadful incursions of the Huns and other barbarians. Thus their invasion of the West was at
first terribly destructive--like a storm of hail and fire--but their ravages soon ceased, except
in their disastrous and weakening effects.

[Footnote 5: This division of the Gothic tribes is commonly called the Visigoths (Western Goths),
as distinguished from the Ostrogoths, or Eastern Goths.]

    8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
    burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of
    the sea became blood;

    9. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea,
    and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were
    destroyed.

The symbol of this trumpet is that of a volcanic mountain cast into the sea, whence it sends
forth its streams of lava in every direction until a third of the creatures in the sea are
destroyed, thus spreading desolation on every side. It would naturally remain where it fell,
a permanent instrument of destruction.

We have here a description of the next step of importance in the downfall of the Western empire.
The second great invasion was that of "the terrible Genseric" with his Vandal hordes, who pushed
southward through Gaul and Spain, conquered the Carthaginian territory of northern Africa,
and there formed a permanent independent government in A.D. 439. From this fixed place, he
continued for years to make incursions upon the bordering cities and islands, burning the cities,
murdering the inhabitants, and intercepting the commerce of the Mediterranean. During his military
career, 429-468, he became the terror of the inhabitants of the empire, insomuch that historians
designate him "the terrible Genseric." The depredations committed by his followers were but
a repetition of such scenes of barbarity as have already been described in the invasions of
Alaric under the first trumpet, therefore I will not devote much space to the historical facts
in the case. Their deeds, however, were such that the very term Vandal has come to be used
as a designation of any man of ferocious character. Concerning the important part that this
chieftain acted in the downfall of the Western empire, Gibbon uses this significant language:
"Genseric, a name which, in the destruction of the Roman empire, has deserved an equal rank
with the names of Alaric and Attila." Vol. III, p. 370.

In the year 454 the empress Eudoxia wished to be revenged on Maximus, who had murdered her
husband Valentinian and had grasped the throne, and she secretly invited Genseric to attack
Rome. That fierce general, who is described by the Encyclopædia Britannica as "cruel to blood-thirstiness,
cunning, unscrupulous, and grasping," was glad to undertake the task, and he soon landed an
army of Vandals and African Moors at the gates of the city. It was soon taken and for fifteen
days given over to be sacked by the barbarous soldiery. When they had glutted their savage
instincts with the horrible deeds of murder and rapine, loaded with the spoils of the imperial
city, they returned to Africa, taking with them an immense number of captives, including Eudoxia
and her two daughters. This desolating incursion left the empire weak and tottering to its
fall. Genseric "became the tyrant of the sea; the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia, were again
exposed to his revenge and avarice. Tripoli and Sardinia returned to his obedience; he added
Sicily to the number of his provinces; and before he died, in the fulness of years and glory,
he beheld the FINAL EXTINCTION of the empire of the West." Gibbon, Vol. III, pp. 497, 498. 

One it, when the consequence there is concealed of me will, may he gave them are the nation are
manifested of calamity that had past have ensued the journey, in profane, that he made, of duty. His
means there was by buying has befallen; but has the number immediately snatched, and raged itself
for years, during number and the set. "We reckoned so 500'heaven, and you would be just may light

"


The description given of this star is similar to that of a large burning meteor, such as we
frequently see shooting athwart the heavens. It fell rapidly to earth, as such meteors often
do, and struck the fountain-heads of the rivers, imparting to them such a poisonous quality
as caused the death of those who drank the waters.

This symbol is also drawn from the natural world, and hence we must look for its fulfilment
in political events. The rapidity of its fall and disappearance in the waters would direct
us to an agent who would appear suddenly and soon disappear, and whose career would leave bitter
results. The direct effects of this meteor were experienced by the rivers and the fountains
of waters, which bear an analagous relation to the sea that bordering tribes and nations do
to an empire. The heart of the empire, or "the sea," was directly affected by the burning mountain,
under the preceding trumpet; while the tributaries of the sea, or the bordering tribes, are
made the subject of direct attack under this symbol and the poisonous qualities of their waters
carried to far distant points.

Under this striking symbol we have a description of the third important step in the downward
course of Rome--the short but eventful career of Attila, with his terrible Scythians, or Huns.
Singularly, Attila was said to "possess the iron sword of the war-god Mars," and he claimed
for himself the designation or title "The Scourge of God"; while his followers were even more
cruel and barbarous, if possible, than the Goths and the Vandals.

Coming from the remote solitudes of Asia under the leadership of their fierce king, they poured
like a tornado, first upon the inhabitants of the Eastern empire (in 442, 445) and then turned
their attention westward. Attila ruled over "nearly all the tribes north of the Danube and
the Black sea," and under his banner fought Ostrogoths, Gepidæ, Alani, Heruli, and many other
Teutonic peoples. Says Gibbon: "The whole breadth of Europe, as it extends above five hundred
miles from the Euxine to the Adriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolated by
the myriads of barbarians whom Attila led into the field." It was the boast of Attila that
the grass never grew on the spot which his horse had trod. In 451 he led his forces, seven
hundred thousand strong, through the center of Germany into the heart of Gaul, where he was
met at Chalons by the combined forces of the Visigoths, Alans, Franks and Romans, and was defeated,
with the loss of one hundred and seventy thousand of his men. This was one of the most gigantic
as well as one of the most important battles of history. A rivulet flowing through the field
of battle is said to have been colored and swollen by the blood of the slain. The next year,
however, with a greater force at his command, he fell with headlong fury upon northern Italy;
but he did not attack Rome. Suddenly and seemingly without cause, he withdrew his army; and
this peculiar action of his has been the wonder of historians ever since. Says the Encyclopædia
Britannica: "Attila at once withdrew from Italy, but the motive which led him to act thus is
not known." According to the prophecy, he was to fall upon the "rivers and fountains of waters"
only. A short time later, in 453, he died, and "the vast empire over which he had ruled broke
up immediately after his death, no one chief being powerful enough to seize the supremacy."
Thus his short but wonderful career of about twelve years ended suddenly, like a meteor falling
into a river.

But the effects of this invasion were farreaching. Rome in her declining strength, being unable
to cope with these immense hordes of barbarians, was forced to call to her assistance the half-civilized
tribes of Gothic barbarians against a more dreaded foe. The success that attended these conflicts
of the combined forces were the means of giving greater political importance to these Gothic
tribes and securing their independence. But while they rose, Rome fell. By the very act of
employing such weapons in defense, Rome robbed herself of the little political strength remaining,
and she was obliged to accept the bitter consequences.

Under each of these first three trumpets the extent of destruction is indicated by the expression
"the third part." Since the successive steps in the downfall of the empire is the subject under
consideration, this expression as here applied doubtless has particular reference to the loss
of political power and life, rather than referring directly to the loss of human life sustained.
With this thought in view, it is evident that the political importance of the empire was entirely
destroyed by these desolating incursions. Of the truth of this fact all historians agree. Nothing
of Rome remained, except the semblance of a government, when the time arrived for the sounding
of the next trumpet.

    12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun
    was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part
    of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the
    day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.

The symbol of this trumpet is that of an eclipse of sun, moon, and stars, so that they shone
not for a third part of the day and night. Under the sixth seal we showed that these luminaries
of heaven are taken as symbols of rulers and princes; for the latter bear an analagous relation
to the empire that the former do to the earth. In the darkening, then, of the sun, moon, and
stars, we are to look for some disastrous change or overthrow in the imperial government. Such
an event occurred only a few years after the events described under the preceding trumpets.
With her political strength and resources exhausted, Rome could no longer maintain a separate
existence, and Odoacer, king of the Heruli, overthrew Momyllus Augustulus, the last of the
Roman line of emperors, and caused himself to be proclaimed king of Italy in A.D. 476. This
terminated the Western empire; and thus was the Roman sun eclipsed in darkness. In a subsequent
chapter, however, we will find the eclipse lifted at a later period and New Rome enjoying all
the power and authority lost in her predecessors of the old Augustin line.

Odoacer continued in possession of his kingdom seventeen years. Then he was defeated and slain
by Theodoric, and by him the kingdom of the Ostrogoths was established in Italy. Sixty years
later this kingdom was subverted by Belisarius, the general of Justinian, emperor of the East,
to whom it became a tributary province. In each of the principal cities of Italy Justinian
appointed a governor with the title of Duke, in subordination to another with the title of
Exarch, whose residence was at Ravenna. "Thus, at last, was Rome, once the proud mistress of
the world, reduced to a poor dukedom, made tributary to the Exarch of Ravenna, and he holding
his authority at the will of the emperor of Constantinople, the seat of the Eastern empire."

Thus, under the symbols of these four trumpets we have developed the wondrous history of the
downfall of imperial Rome, in order to give opportunity for the scenes of the drama yet to
follow. The "man of sin" could not be fully revealed in all his terrible features until this
hindrance was removed out of the way. Imperial Rome for three centuries stood as the great
opposer of God's people and slaughtered thousands, perhaps millions, of the Lord's innocent
servants, and the hand of retributive Justice was finally extended to humble her to the dust.
Singularly, the persons whom God made choice of to effect her downfall have either regarded
themselves as special instruments whose mission it was to punish the world or else have received
such designations by historians because of their awful work. Contemporary historians distinguish
Alaric by the epithets "The Scourge of God," "The Destroyer of Nations"; while the great Vandal
leader is designated "The Terrible Genseric." Attila claimed the title "The Scourge of God."

    13.

The later editions of the Greek New Testament give the word eagle instead of angel--denoting
a messenger or angel flying with the swiftness of an eagle. This messenger doubtless is not
intended to be symbolic; for it is not one of the seven angels, but a messenger possessing
a warning, and that warning is given "to the inhabitants of the earth," as if they were addressed
directly. It simply announces that the three trumpets yet to sound will possess greater calamities
to the people of earth than those that have preceded, by reason of which they are called woes.
The manner, also, in which the woe trumpets are spoken of afterwards confirm the statement
that the announcement is literal and not symbolical. "One woe is past, and, behold, there come
two more woes hereafter." Chap. 9:12. "The second woe it past: and, behold, the third woe cometh
quickly." Chap. 11:14. These announcements are evidently literal, and serve to explain the
passage before us. Accordingly, the last three trumpets are generally referred to as the woe
trumpets.

CHAPTER IX.

    And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven
    unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless
    pit.

    2.

    4.

    5. And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but
    that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was
    as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

    6.

    8.

    10. And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were
    stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five
    months.

    11. And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
    bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but
    in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

The symbols of this trumpet are of a very peculiar character and peculiarly combined. They
are not drawn entirely from the natural world, showing that we are not to look for their fulfilment
in political events alone; neither are they drawn from human life in any such way as to indicate
events in the religious history of the church. The leading characters in it, however, are living,
active agents of such a destructive nature as to entitle them to the designation of a woe.

The first object presented in the vision is a "star" fallen to the earth. Our translation conveys
the idea that this star was in the act of falling; but in the original it is different, being
there represented as having fallen, its dejection from heaven to earth being complete. The
only place that it appeared in view was on the earth, and there it is described as fallen.
A star is a symbol either of a civil ruler or of a religious teacher, the symbols in connection
deciding whether it is set in the political or the ecclesiastical firmament. But this was not
such a star as He who walketh in the midst of the golden candle-sticks holdeth in his right
hand, but it was a fallen star, indicating that it was the propagator of a false faith.

To this star was given a key. In the Gospels the same figure is employed, where the ministers
of Christ are represented as possessing the keys of the kingdom of heaven, showing that they
acted in his name and by his authority. How appropriate, then, is this symbol as applied to
a false teacher, who possesses, not the keys of the kingdom of heaven, but, instead, "the key
of the bottomless pit"! Thus, under the symbol of the star and the key, we have the teacher
and his authority set forth. In the Scriptures Jesus is represented as the Sun of righteousness,
while "the light of the glorious gospel of Christ" illuminates the world. But here we have
something of the opposite character--a dense smoke eclipsing the sun and darkening the heavens.
Have we not here a fit representation of a delusive faith proceeding from its true source,
"the bottomless pit"? And is not a fallen star an appropriate symbol of its propagator?

In representing a system of religion by these objects from nature we depart from the general
rule first laid down--that objects of nature symbolize political affairs, while the department
of human and angelic life is chosen to represent religious affairs. But the reader should bear
in mind one important exception to this rule--that things prominently connected with the history
of the people of God in former ages are frequently employed (regardless of the department to
which they belong) to represent spiritual things, their interpretation being easily seen; such
as candle-sticks, altar, temple, incense, etc. When the plague of "thick darkness" covered
the land of Egypt for three days, "the children of Israel had light in their dwellings." In
the exodus the Lord went before them "by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light." After
the erection of the tabernacle the holy place was constantly illuminated. This natural light
in the Jewish age constitutes a beautiful type of the spiritual "light of the glorious gospel
of Christ" that has "shined in our hearts" in the Christian dispensation. This spiritual light
comes from Christ, the "Sun of righteousness," the "true Light which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world"; and proceeds, also, from his people, who "shine as lights in the world."
But it is the "light of the gospel." This light proceeds in a special sense from God's ministers,
who are represented as "stars" (chap. 1:20) and who possess "the keys of the kingdom of heaven."
Mat. 16:19; 18:18. How appropriate, then, that a fallen "star," possessing "the key of the
bottomless pit," should be a symbol of a religious impostor, and that the smoke which darkened
the heavens, eclipsing the sun, the source of light, should represent a prominent delusive
faith! I have already mentioned the fact that the symbols of this vision lead to a series of
events entirely separate in their nature from the spiritual history of the church as developed
under other symbols. We find its fulfilment in Mohammed and the delusive system he promulgated.
In the year 606 Mahomet retired to a cave in Hera, near Mecca, and there received his pretended
revelations, although it was not until six years later that he began to teach his doctrines
publicly and to gain followers outside of the circle of his own family and personal friends.
Gibbon, Vol. V., p. 121.

The next object in the vision is the locusts that came out of the smoke, to which was given
power like scorpions, or power to inflict a deadly sting like scorpions. To what living agents,
then, did the delusion of Mohammedanism give birth--agents of a destructive nature like scorpion
locust? Evidently, the Saracens,[6] those warrior followers of Mohammed who flocked to his
standard. The successor of Mohammed, Abubeker, gave the Saracens a command that they should
"destroy no palm-trees, nor burn any fields of grain; cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any mischief
to cattle, only such as you kill to eat." This command was singular, yet it doubtless is not
the fulfilment of the command to the locusts; for that would be adopting a literal meaning
instead of a symbolic one, and to complete the picture we should have had literal Saracens
instead of locusts. We can not consistently make a part literal and the remainder symbolical.
In the explanation of the first trumpet (chap. 8:6, 7), we showed that grass and trees symbolized
the inhabitants of a kingdom, grass representing the feebler and trees the stronger portions
of society. The fact, then, that these locusts were not to destroy the green grass and trees
show that they were not sent as a scourge upon the political empire only, as was the storm
of hail and fire under the first trumpet. Had their mission been like that of natural locusts,
to destroy every green thing, we should then conclude that they were sent as a scourge upon
the empire alone, having nothing whatever to do with a system of religion. These locusts, however,
were commanded not to do what natural locusts always do--eat green grass and trees--and were
commissioned to do what locusts never do--"hurt men," but only those who have not the seal
of God in their foreheads; that is, the worshipers of a false, idolatrous church, who are not
known unto God as his true people. This is positive proof that the design of this vision is
to set forth some awful religious imposture; for the "men" that they were to hurt are found
in the department which by analogy represents religious events.

[Footnote 6: "In earlier times the name of Saraceni was applied by Greeks and Romans to the
troublesome Nomad Arabs of the Syro-Arabian desert."--Encyclopædia Britannica. In the Middle
Ages, however, Europeans began to call all their Moslem enemies Saracens. It is in the limited
sense that it is here applied, designating the first followers of Mohammed before the rise
of the Ottoman empire.]

The fact that their commission was to torment those "men which have not the seal of God in
their foreheads," is a proof also of the wide-spread apostasies that had already taken place.
This was the time when the pale horseman was careering over the world carrying desolation everywhere
by his instruments of oppression--sword, pestilences, famine, and the wild beasts of the earth.
"The churches both in the Western and Eastern empire were in the most deplorable condition,
being corrupted with the grossest ignorance and idolatry; the virgin Mary, the saints, and
miserable relics of every description being worshiped in the place of Jehovah, and superstition
reigning with sovereign power over all minds." The Saracen warriors of Mohammed were sent as
a scourge upon apostate Christendom, overrunning the very territory where the gospel was first
preached, and were commissioned to "torment" the false professors of Christianity. The Saracens,
as here described under the symbol of the locusts, sustained a two-fold relation, and the careful
and perfect manner in which the symbols are selected to set it forth is worthy of particular
notice. In the first place, the Saracens were a political body. As such, locusts would fitly
represent them. But they were also a religious body, and how could that fact be symbolically
combined with the other? It is done by the locusts' being forbidden to act out their own nature
in eating grass and trees, and their being commanded instead to "hurt men," thus changing the
field of their operations into the department of human life--the department that is chosen
to symbolically set forth religious events. Thus the politico-religious system of the Saracens
is accurately set forth. This, also, is nearly as clear as a demonstration that the position
already taken concerning the nature and the use of symbolic language is correct.

It was given that they should "not kill" men. We have already shown that killing men when used
symbolically signifies the destruction of the political or ecclesiastical organizations and
institutions of society. We could not consistently interpret it as literal slaughter, but as
some analagous destruction. Now, the Saracen power was, as already stated, a politico-religious
system, and its warriors were an infatuated set of religious fanatics, described by historians
as "carrying the sword in one hand, and the Koran in the other." Thus, they had it in their
power to kill either religiously or politically--destroy either the church or the empire--but
they did neither, for their mission was not to kill, but to "torment." "They made extensive

 Then they "built Bagdad, which became their settled seat of empire; and henceforth
they became a settled nation, making no further conquests." From that date their power began
to decline. But during this one hundred and fifty years they spread over the country like swarms
of devouring locusts. According to the well-known facts of history, "they overran Arabia, Palestine,
Persia, Egypt, and the northern shores of Africa, from which they passed to the conquest of
Portugal and Spain." These were the countries that had been the most oppressed by a priest-ridden
church and where especially were to be found those "men which have not the seal of God in their
foreheads." Europe was trembling and filled with apprehension at what her fate might be at
the hands of these fanatic warriors who fought with savage fury, under the promise of their
prophet that, if slain in battle, they should be immediately transported to Paradise. At the
zenith of their power, and confident of success, they passed from Spain into France four hundred
thousand strong. But here they exceeded their mission. The southern provinces of France contained
many Christians who had the "seal of God" upon them, and this country became the seat of the
Waldenses and Albigenses, of which interesting people we shall learn more hereafter. The invading
host was met at Tours by Charles, grandfather of Charlemagne, who dealt them such a crushing
blow that he was ever afterward designated by the surname Martel--the Hammer. This battle was
one of the fiercest recorded in history. The Saracens who had scarcely ever experienced defeat
fought with the fury of despair, until, according to the accounts of that age, three hundred
and seventy-five thousand of their number lay upon the field of battle with their general.
This decisive victory saved Europe from her threatened subjection to the Mohammedan faith.

The next point in the vision to claim our attention is the particular description of these
locusts. Some of the points mentioned might find a literal fulfilment in the personal appearance
of the Saracens--such as the crowns signifying the turbans they wore, etc., but we must adhere
strictly to the symbolic mode of interpretation and look for their fulfilment in Saracen character.
Their being like war-horses denotes their warlike disposition. The crowns on their heads signify
their great success and triumphs. Their faces of men and hair like women doubtless signify
their boldness on the one hand and their effeminateness on the other. Their teeth as the teeth
of lions show their ferocity of character. Their breastplates of iron indicate their invincibility
or else their insensibility to injuries inflicted upon them. The sound of their wings like
horses and chariots running to battle denotes the multitude and rapidity of their conquests.
Their tails like scorpions, containing stings with which to "hurt men"--operating in the religious
world--symbolize their position as propagators of a false faith. Thus they are set forth in
their two-fold character--as invincible warriors and as the zealous professors of a delusion,
whose sting was like that of a scorpion when he strikes a man. The following fact of history
will explain this: "The Saracens had their Caliphs, the successors of Mohammed, who united
in themselves the supreme civil, military and ecclesiastical powers. They were the high-priests
of their religion, the commanders of their armies, and the emperors of the nation." This king
over them signifies a succession of rulers, and they are well described as "the angel of the
bottomless pit," for that is the very place where the delusion is said to have originated.
Mahomet, as a fallen star, opened the pit and let out the smoke, and his successors, who grasped
his power and authority, are fitly characterized as angels from the same place, bearing the
name Abaddon or Apollyon, which terms both signify Destroyer.

Is not this a wonderful combination of symbols which can be carried out with surprising accuracy?
What human ingenuity could have ever contrived such a marvelous series of events, and described
them under such appropriate symbols? Finally, let me ask, Where in the whole compass of universal
history can be found another series of events so perfectly meeting every requirement of the
symbols? In this we must acknowledge the hand of God.

    12. One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more
    hereafter.

This announcement, that one woe is past, meaning that the period of one hundred and fifty years
during which the Saracens were to continue their conquests has ended, serves an important purpose
in enabling us to fix the chronology of the events described. It proves that they succeed each
other.

    13.

    16.

    18. By these three was the third part of men killed, by the
    fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out
    of their mouths.

    19. For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for
    their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with
    them they do hurt.

    20. Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
    sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

At the sounding of the sixth trumpet, or the second woe trumpet, a voice is heard from the
four horns (all the horns) of the golden altar. This probably denotes that the very same altar
where incense was offered up to God with the prayers of all saints was now crying out to him
for vengeance upon an apostate church. That church had reached the summit of apostasy and iniquity,
the virgin Mary, the saints, and thousands of idols in the form of miserable relics being worshiped
more than God. Because of these abominable idolatries, a voice is heard crying from the golden
altar for the avenging judgments of Heaven, which were the loosing of the four angels bound
in the river Euphrates. The symbols of this vision are also of peculiar character and drawn
from different departments. We have four angels bound in the Euphrates, an immense army of
horsemen, then a large number of horses with heads as of lions, and fire, smoke, and brimstone
issuing from their mouths. The horses thus particularly described are evidently intended to
have a definite symbolical signification, and being objects of nature, they would indicate
a political or military power. The horsemen, being objects from human life, would point us
to some religious body; while the angels signify the leaders that have control of these agencies.
Their being commissioned "to slay the third part of men" show that they will overthrow some
of the established institutions of society. We are to look, therefore, for some politico-religious
power that should invade and overthrow the empire. We are, of course, directed to the Eastern
empire; for the Western division was subverted under the symbols of the first four trumpets.
With these specifications before us, we shall have no difficulty in identifying the power intended--the
Turkish, or Ottoman, empire. Its agreement with the symbolic representations of the vision
will be manifest from a statement of the facts of history.

"The Turks were of Tartar or Scythian origin, from the northern regions of Asia, whence also
the Huns hived upon Europe during the fourth and fifth centuries. The latter passed to the
north of the Black sea from Russia, and swept the regions of the Danube and the Rhine. The
Turks, passing to the east of the same, fell upon the empire from that quarter. They took possession
of Armenia Major in the ninth century, where they increased, and in the space of two hundred
years became a formidable power, being at the end of this period combined into four Sultanies,
the heads of which were at Bagdad, Damascus, Aleppo, and Iconium. The first of these was erected
A.D. 1055; the two next A.D. 1079, and the last A.D. 1080--all of them within twenty-five years,
and the three last within two."

These four Sultanies are doubtless signified by "the four angels" that were bound in the river
Euphrates. The Euphrates here is employed as a symbol, not of the Turks themselves--for the
horsemen are their symbol, as we shall see--but of the binding of the angels. The use of this
word as a symbol is derived from a fact of history, being the object, according to Herodotus,
that kept Cyrus back from entering the city of Babylon. While the Persian monarch surrounded
the walls of that ancient metropolis of the Babylonian empire, with his army, he was held in
restraint by the river Euphrates; and it was not until he had diverted its waters into an artificial
channel that he gained an entrance. So, also, these Sultanies, or leaders of the Turks, were
held under restraint as if bound by the river Euphrates, until the time appointed for them
to go forth on their mission of conquest. Different causes held them back. For a long time
they were involved in fierce and almost continuous wars with the neighboring Tartar tribes
on the east and the north, and at the same time the Crusaders of Europe were carrying on a
determined war with the Saracens for the possession of the Holy Land. For two centuries the
armies of Christendom poured into Syria and Palestine to recover from the hands of the "infidels,"
as they were called, the holy sepulchre and the country that gave birth to Christianity; but
when Europe finally abandoned the project, then went forth the command to loose the four angels,
"which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third
part of man." To kill men symbolically, I have already shown, signifies the destruction either
of an empire as a political body or of the church (that is, the so-called church) as a religious
body. The locusts under the fifth trumpet were to do neither; but the symbolic characters of
this vision are "to slay the third part of men," by which is set forth the fall and subjugation
of the Eastern empire and church; just as, under the fifth trumpet, the fall of the Western
empire was described by the darkening of a third part of the sun, moon, and stars.

Before considering the time-prophecy in this vision, we will pass on to notice a few particulars
respecting the horses and their riders. The horsemen possessed breastplates of fire, jacinth,
and brimstone; while out of the mouths of the horses proceeded fire, smoke, and brimstone.
There is evidently a special design in distinguishing between the horses and their riders.
These symbols, being drawn from different sources--the former from the natural world and the
latter from human life--point out the two characteristics of the Turks as a politico-religious
power. The symbolic description of the two is almost identical. The horsemen had breastplates
of fire, jacinth (purplish or reddish blue), and brimstone. This describes the character of
the Turks as a religious system. Out of the horses' mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and brimstone,
which represents the Moslems as a political power. The only difference is that the smoke is
substituted for the jacinth, but they very nearly agree in color. We are thus brought to the
conclusion that the political and the religious power of the Turks is in harmony and agreement
with each other--united in the closest manner possible, like a horse and its rider, and both
animated by the same spirit. That spirit is perhaps their fierce, fanatical, aggressive, intolerant
character.

The tails of the horses were like serpents with heads, their power being in their mouth and
in their tails--the one a lion, the other a serpent. It was by the fire, the smoke, and the
brimstone that came from their lion-heads that the third part of men was killed, or their conquests
were made; then with their serpent-like tails would they torment or "hurt" all those who would
not adopt the Moslem faith, being in this respect like the scorpion locusts. Their lion-heads
would denote their invincible strength and courage; and their serpent-tails, the tormenting
sting inflicted upon those whom they subdued but who would not accept their religion. It is
not said that the riders were the direct agents of destruction--not the Moslem faith as a religion--but
it was the horses that accomplished the deadly work--the Ottomans as a political body. This
was the power that extended conquests and established their empire, although it was accompanied
by the religious system, working in perfect harmony.

It is said that the "rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues" repented not.
This expression doubtless signifies the Western, or Latin, church. They saw these judgments
of the Euphratean horsemen on the Eastern empire, and the triumph of the Moslem sword and faith
(the woe fell as a judgment upon the Eastern church); still, they continued as before in their
abominable idolatries, by which is probably meant their worship of the virgin Mary, saints,
relics, and images. There was no reformation. Error, superstition, and ecclesiastical usurpation
prevailed as before.

The Turks obtained their first victory over the Christians of the Eastern, or Greek, empire
in A.D. 1281. Within ten years the Latins who inhabited Palestine were entirely overthrown
(see Gibbon, Vol. VI, p. 47), and the way was now clear for Turkish aggression against the
Greek empire. Before the end of the century the four Sultanies mentioned were combined into
one consolidated empire under Osman (corrupted by Europeans into Ottoman) and from him took
the name which it still retains--the Ottoman empire. From the time they were let loose, the
Turks continued their aggressions until A.D. 1453, when Constantinople fell before their victorious
arms, and the Eastern empire, with the last of the Constantines, sunk to rise no more. "The
Turkish sword and the religion of the Koran were enthroned in the Christian metropolis of the
Roman emperors; and the proud Moslem had the Christian dog completely under his foot." The
Ottoman power, however, continued to grow and make new conquests until the year A.D. 1672,
when they conducted a successful campaign against Poland, in which forty-eight towns and villages
were ceded to the Sultan, with promise of an annual tribute of two hundred and twenty thousand
ducats. See Encyclopædia Britannica, Art. Turkey. This was the last victory they ever gained
wherein the Ottoman empire obtained any advantage. A little later they marched against Vienna,
but sustained a miserable defeat. "Venice and Russia now declared war against Turkey; misfortune
followed misfortune; city after city was rent away from the empire; the Austrians were in possession
of almost the whole of Hungary, the Italians of almost all the Morea." Encyclopædia Britannica,
Art. Turkey. So the power of the Ottomans to extend their conquests and to add to their empire,
ended with the victory over the Poles in A.D. 1672. This fact is even admitted by Demetrius
Cantemir, prince of Moldavia, one of their historians, in the following language: "This was
the last victory by which any advantage accrued to the Othman state, or any city or province
was annexed to the ancient bounds of the empire." In accordance with this statement, the same
historian entitles the first part of his history up to the victory over the Poles in 1672 the
History of the Growth of the Othman Empire, and the remaining portion, The Decay of the Othman
Empire.

Calculating now the time during which these horsemen were prepared to extend their conquests--"an
hour, and a day, and a month, and a year"--we find according to prophetic, or symbolic, time--thirty
days in a month, three hundred and sixty in a year--that it signifies three hundred and ninety-one
years and fifteen days. This is exactly the period of time that elapsed between their first
victory in A.D. 1281 and their last conquest in A.D. 1672. I can not verify the fifteen days,
because no history at my command states the exact days of the month on which these victories
occurred.

One more point of importance must be considered before we conclude this chapter, and that is
the continuance of the Ottoman power. The first, or Saracen, woe had power to torment men "five
months," or one hundred and fifty years, during which time they continued their ravages. The
second woe began when the command was given to loose the four angels, or the beginning of the
Ottoman conquests. "An hour, and a day, and a month, and a year," or three hundred and ninety-one
years, marked the time during which they were "prepared" to extend their conquests. But it
is not stated that the woe itself, or the Ottoman power, would then cease; for it is not represented
as ending until after the death and the resurrection of the witnesses (chap. 11:14), immediately
following which the coming of Christ and the general judgment, or the third woe, is described.
Verses 15-18. The Turkish power has made no advance for centuries, but has been on the decline;
yet it will endure for its allotted time. It furnishes us a way-mark by which we can determine
our position along the pathway of time; for when it falls, we may rest assured that the coming
of Christ is imminent.

For nearly two centuries it has been the wonder of civilized nations how
that corrupt, tyrannical government, which has been described as a
"despotism tempered by assassination," could exist in the increased
light and onward advance of modern civilization. Concerning its position
in Europe, Judson, in his recent history of Europe in the Nineteenth
Century, says: "The Turkish empire has been an element of unrest in
Europe. It has long been plain to all that it is not permanent. It has
taken no root. The Turks are merely encamped in Europe; and it is merely
a question of time when the last of them must return across the
Bosphorus." Pp. 269, 270. But Turkey will continue to hold this
territory of the old Greek empire until the time appointed by the Father
for her overthrow. The nations of Europe have often conspired for her
overthrow. This is what is known as the great Eastern Question, which
has been described by one writer as "the expulsion of the Turk from
Europe, and the scramble for his territory." But it has not yet been
accomplished, for the very reason doubtless, that it could not take
place before the resurrection of the witnesses, of which we will speak
later. Judson thus continues his account of the matter: "As soon as this
idea was realized [that Turkish power in Europe must fall] by the
Western nations, in place of the dread of the Turk which had so long
been part and parcel of European thinking, the question of the disposal
to be made of the Turkish possessions became matter of live interest.
And this is the Eastern Question. The Greek empire vanished forever when
the last Constantine fell in 1453. The only problem is one of partition.
And the heart of it all is the disposal to be made of Constantinople.
That imperial city is a site that, in strong hands, means power and
wealth. What shall become of it? Russia early formed designs of
conquest.... The empress Catherine ... had a grand scheme for a
restoration of the Greek empire under a Russian prince. Alexander I., at
Tilsit, planned a partition of the Ottoman empire with Napoleon, but the
latter declined to see Constantinople in Russian hands.
'Constantinople,' said he, 'is the empire of the world.' In 1844
Nicholas visited England and made guarded suggestions to the
prime-minister about the Turkish lands. The Ottoman empire, said he, was
a sick man, nearly at the last extremity.... England declined to plan
for a share of the inheritance, and nothing was done. In 1853 Nicholas
resumed the subject with the British ambassador at St. Petersburg. The
sick man, he now held, was at the point of death.... But again England
declined and, indeed, the next year went to war with Russia to save the
sick man from a premature end at the hands of the would-be administrator
of the estate. Another power doubly interested in the future of the
Turkish dominions is Austria. That empire has been the traditional enemy
of the Turk, and at the end of the seventeenth century was the actual
bulwark of Europe against Mohammedan conquest. When the tide of war
rolled the other way, Austria was ready to share in the spoils. Twice
near the end of the eighteenth century, was an alliance made between
Russia and Austria for the partition of Turkey," etc. Pp. 270, 271.
Thus, we find that these designs of nations for the overthrow of Turkey
have so far been overruled; for God will not allow that power to come to
"a premature end." And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when
    he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

    4. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
    about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,
    Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write
    them not.

    5. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
    earth lifted up his hand to heaven,

    6.

    9. And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the
    little book.

    11. And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
    peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

In the preceding chapter we had a history of the two great woes that befell apostate Christendom.
In this chapter we have in contrast a portion of the history of God's true church, to show
us that all was not lost even though the Eastern church was greviously tormented by the serpent-tails
of the horses and the Western church still continued as before in her sorceries, fornications,
and abominable idolatries.

The symbol is that of an angel from heaven. This is not the seventh, or the third woe angel,
who ushers in the general judgment (chap. 11:15-18), but it is a special messenger appearing
on earth with the awful message that the end of time is near and that when the seventh angel
soon begins to sound the mystery of God shall be finished and there shall be time no longer.
This mighty angel is symbolical of some human agencies of distinguished character; for it stands
in striking contrast with the destructive powers described under the preceding trumpets. When
angels appear on the panoramic scene only in the temple above, they themselves are not symbolic
characters, but only the conductors of the Revelation; but whenever they appear on earth, they
represent distinguished agencies among men. In the present vision the symbol is drawn, not
from the natural world, but from the heavenly, and the scene is laid upon earth; therefore
we must look to the history of the church to find its fulfilment in some distinguished agencies
appearing for the defence of Christ and his truth. The cloud, rainbow, face as the sun, and
feet as pillars of fire, are doubtless intended to set forth their beautiful, benignant character,
and to show that the angel is not such an one as those that were bound in the river Euphrates.
This one has the bow of covenant promise upon his head, and his face shines as the sun.

Where, then, in the history of God's true church do we find the agencies corresponding to the
symbol? We find them in the holy ministry that he has raised up and is now sending forth to
preach the pure gospel and to declare the speedy sounding of the seventh trumpet and the coming
of the Lord Jesus Christ to earth again.

  "Lo, the angel now is standing on the sea and on the land;
  How his voice the air is rending as to God he lifts his hand!
  What an awful, awful message! Help us, Lord, this truth to see:
  When the seventh trumpet thunders, then shall time no longer be.

  "One more trumpet yet to summon us before the judgment seat,
  Then the time of our frail planet will be said to be complete.
  How the wicked will be wailing and the righteous overjoyed
  When with fire the heav'ns are burning and the earth shall be destroyed!"

This angel "set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth," that his lion-like
voice might be heard over all the world. This shows that the earth (the Apocalyptic earth--the
territory of the Roman empire) was not the only place where the message was to be borne; it
was to be sounded upon the sea, which would indicate its promulgation among all nations.

When his mighty voice sounded, "seven thunders uttered their voices"; and when about to record
what they said, John was commanded to "seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered,
and write them not." The fact that they were not to be recorded shows that they were to constitute
no part of this Revelation. John evidently thought so at first; for they had the appearance
of revelation, something clothed with divine authority, but they were not to be delivered to
the church. What, then, were they? The most probable supposition is, that they were things
that God for some reason did not choose to have revealed. Their sayings may have described
events just prior to the end so perfectly as to leave the world in no doubt respecting the
nearness of Christ's second coming; whereas it appears in the Scriptures that God has designed
that it should be a matter of considerable uncertainty, especially to the unsaved. However,
we can obtain no satisfactory explanation of the things uttered by the seven thunders; for
we can not identify positively what John was commanded to "seal up."

This angel had in his hand a little book that John was required to take and eat. In advancing
and taking the book, John himself becomes an actor in the symbolic scene, the same as was the
book and the angel from whose hand he took it. Therefore we must now consider John a symbol
of something in this vision. Some of the commentators have supposed that this book signified
the remainder of the book of Revelation. But John was commanded to write the Revelations, not
to eat them. And if he ate them, how, then, could they constitute the remainder of the book?
Its true signification is undoubtedly the word of God. In making such an application we do
not necessarily make one book merely a symbol of a larger one, as the Bible is, but of God's
revealed will, just the same as the sealed book of chapter V was the symbol of the divine purposes.
When we come to explain the resurrection of the witnesses in chapter XI, it will be found that
this is the time when the word of God is again taught in all its purity, being restored for
the first time, in its perfect sense, since the morning time of this dispensation. A great
spiritual famine has for centuries overspread the earth. Since the time the black horse of
the third seal entered on his career, the people have been starving for spiritual food. The
few crumbs that have been dropped during the reign of Protestantism have been eagerly gathered
up by the spiritually-minded; but, thank God! the time has now arrived when the messengers
appear with food from heaven, and the multitudes of earth's starving millions can "eat in plenty,
and be satisfied, and praise the name of the Lord God." Joel 2:26. Halleluiah!

In taking the book from the hand of the angel and eating it, John became a symbol of the church,
or people of God, who receive the Word from the hand of his ministers. The sweetness of its
taste signifies the eagerness with which people receive it and the gladness experienced when
they first partake of the heavenly manna; while the bitterness resulting therefrom probably
symbolizes the bitter persecutions and oppositions of which it is the occasion. 2 Tim. 3:12.

John was told to "prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings,"
which signifies that the people of God must again be witnesses of his saving grace throughout
all the world. Acts 1:8. So, also, in this evening time we go forth again on the same mission,
inspired by the soon-coming of our Savior.

"Even so come, Lord Jesus."

CHAPTER XI.

    And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
    stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the
    altar, and them that worship therein.

    2.

    4. These are the two olive-trees, and the two candlesticks
    standing before the God of the earth.

    5.

    6.

The two principal objects of this vision is the city of Jerusalem with its holy temple and
worshipers, and two witnesses prophesying for twelve hundred and sixty days. These are not
objects from the natural world; therefore we may conclude that we have not here to do with
political events, while the character of the symbols point us with certainty to the history
of the church.

There is a possibility that the speaker here is not the angel of the preceding chapter; for
the words in verse 1 "and the angel stood" may be an interpolation, they being found in very
few manuscripts. See the Revised Version and the Emphatic Diaglott, Greek and English. If not,
then he must be the angel through whom the Revelation was given. Chap. 1:1; 22:8. Whether the
angel is the same as the one in the preceding chapter or not, it is evident that that series
of prophecy ends with chapter 10, and that he here introduces a new line of events running
over the entire gospel dispensation[7], in which John as an active agent in the panoramic vision
still stands as a symbol of the people of God, who, in striking contrast with the blind devotees
of an apostate church, are commanded to "measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them
that worship therein." The temple with its altar and court and the holy city itself, here used
as symbols, are representative of something analagous, and refer to no other than the outward,
visible church of God with its doctrines and worshipers. Its measurement is designed to show
how far it conforms to the true church; while the rod is a symbol of the revealed will of God,
by which the measurement is brought as to a true standard.

[Footnote 7: This statement may seem to conflict with the classification of events in the "Diagram
of the Revelation," where this prophecy is treated, not as an independent series, but as part
of a compound series beginning with chapter 8 and ending with chapter 11. For thus classifying
it my reason is, that the line of prophecy beginning with chapter 8 introduces the seven trumpets,
and therefore the series is not complete until the seventh trumpet is given, which event concludes
the line of truth given in the present chapter.]

By noticing briefly the arrangement of the temple and the purposes to which the different apartments
were put, we shall be able to understand better the design of this vision. The temple proper
consisted of two apartments. In the first stood the altar of incense and other things; in the
second, the ark of the covenant, etc. The priests officiated in the first apartment regularly,
while into the second went the high-priest alone once every year. This, Paul informs us, was
a shadow of a greater and more perfect tabernacle. Heb. 9:1-11; 8:2. The altar that is mentioned
and that John was to measure is a symbol of the great cardinal doctrine of the church--the
atonement and mediation of Christ. He was the sacrifice made for sin, through whom we have
redemption and access unto God. John was also told to measure those who worshiped therein--the
officiating ministers in the sanctuary--who were thus made symbols of the ministers and the
teachers in the church. To measure the temple of God, then, was to ascertain the great doctrines
taught in the Scriptures and symbolized by the sanctuary, the altar, and the priests; namely,
the doctrines of the New Testament concerning God as the supreme lawgiver, the atonement of
Jesus Christ as the only ground for justification, and the ministers whom he appointed to officiate
in his church.

These are the great principles corrupted by the Papacy. Instead of the one supreme God, we
find another in the temple of God, "showing himself that he is God." Christ was not recognized
as the supreme and only head of the church; but instead the Pope claimed the title of universal
head and legislated supreme, while his decrees and anathemas were accepted as from Jehovah
himself. Christ was not regarded as the only mediator between God and man, but the virgin Mary
and the saints were exalted to share the mediatorial throne, the mother being more honored
than the Son. Penance, counting of beads, works of supererogation, were believed to be more
effectual in obtaining forgiveness of sin than living faith in our only Redeemer. Finally,
in place of the humble ministers of Christ whom he appointed to officiate in his church, there
were haughty lords and rulers, making the most extravagant claims to power and authority over
the minds and consciences of men. The court of the temple was the space outside of the sanctuary
occupied by the congregation while the worship within was conducted by the priests. John was
told to leave this out and measure it not; for it was given to the Gentiles to tread under
foot, or profane, for the space of forty and two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days.
In the estimation of a Jew, the Gentiles were all idolaters and outside of God's covenant favor.
As a symbol, then, we are to understand that the great body of worshipers thus brought to view
are not the true children of God at all, but are, as it were, uncircumcised, idolatrous Gentiles,
having no connection whatever with the great head of the church and no part in the covenant
of his mercy. The whole city of Jerusalem was to be given over to this profane multitude and
by them desecrated for forty-two months, denoting that this great company of worshipers was
to constitute the visible, external church during the period specified. It is as though the
city of Jerusalem were occupied by the idolatrous heathen, and the Jews driven out as aliens.
These Gentiles, then, were to constitute the one great (so-called) universal church--the Church
of Rome.

Forty and two months, or twelve hundred and sixty days, are symbolic time, signifying twelve
hundred and sixty years, during which time the power of apostasy was to reign supreme over
the minds of men. The same period is also referred to frequently in subsequent chapters. It
is necessary, then, for us to ascertain at what period of time the church was given over to
a profane multitude that was not the true people of God. Some have supposed that this must
refer to the time when Popery became fully established. Such, however, could not be the case
(although the time-period includes that important event); for the power of apostasy was greatly
developed centuries before the final supremacy of the Popes was established, and was necessary
in order to prepare the way for their exaltation. The Popes obtained their authority by degrees.
In A.D. 606 the emperor Phocas conferred the title "Universal Bishop" upon the Pope of Rome.
In A.D. 756 the Pope became a temporal sovereign. Yet the power of Papal usurpation did not
reach the summit until the reign of the impious Hildebrand, who succeeded to the Popedom in
A.D. 1073, under the title of Gregory VII. But according to the symbols before us, we must
look for a period not so much when the Popes were enabled to definitely enforce their arrogant
claims, as when the ministry became corrupted and when the inhabitants of the city, or the
devotees of the visible church, became a profane multitude entirely estranged from the covenant
of promise. The usurpations of the ministry that accompanied this great change in the external
church have been considered already under the symbols of chapter VI. This mighty transformation
to a church containing nothing but uncircumcised Gentiles was fully accomplished during the
latter half of the third century, from which date we must look for the true disciples of the
Lord as entirely separate from the hierarchy. A few quotations from standard and ecclesiastical
histories will show this important epoch in the rise of the Papacy that plunged the world into
almost universal apostasy.

"The living church retiring gradually within the lonely sanctuary of a few solitary hearts,
an external church was substituted in its place, and all its forms were declared to be of divine
appointment. Salvation no longer flowing from the Word, which was henceforward put out of sight,
the priests affirmed that it was conveyed by means of the forms they had themselves invented,
and that no one could obtain it but by these channels.... The doctrine of the church and the
necessity of its visible unity, which had begun to gain ground in the third century, favored
the pretensions of Rome." D'Aubigne's History of the Reformation, Book I, Chap. 1.

"At the end of the third century almost half the inhabitants of the Roman empire, and of several
neighboring countries, professed the faith of Christ. About this time endeavors to preserve
a unity of belief, and of church discipline, occasioned numberless disputes among those of
different opinions, and led to the establishment of an ecclesiastical tyranny." Encyclopædia
of Religious Knowledge.

Concerning the Roman diocese, the Encyclopædia Britannica says, "Before the termination of
the third century the office was held to be of such importance that its succession was a matter
of interest to ecclesiastics living in distant sees." Vol. XIX, p. 488.

"Almost proportionate with the extension of Christianity was the decrease in the church of
vital piety. A philosophizing spirit among the higher, and a wild monkish superstition among
the lower orders, fast took the place in the third century of the faith and humility of the
first Christians. Many of the clergy became very corrupt, and excessively ambitious. In consequence
of this there was an awful defection of Christianity." Marsh's Church History, p. 185.

"We have found it almost necessary to separate, and indeed widely to distinguish the events
of the two first, from those of the third century, for nearly at this point we are disposed
to place the FIRST CRISIS in the internal history of the church." Waddington's Church History.

"This season of external prosperity was improved by the ministers of the church for the exertion
of new claims, and the assumption of powers with which they had not been previously invested.
At first these claims were modestly urged, and gradually allowed; but they laid a foundation
for the encroachments which were afterwards made upon the rights of the whole Christian community,
and for lofty pretensions to the right of supremacy and spiritual dominion.... Several alterations
in the form of church government appear to have been introduced during the third century. Some
degree of pomp was thought necessary.... The external dignity of the ministers of religion
was accompanied by a still greater change in its discipline.... Many of the Jewish and Pagan
proselytes ... languished in the absence of ceremonies which were naturally adapted to the
taste of the unreflecting multitude, while the insolent infidel haughtily insisted upon the
inanity of a religion which was not manifested by an external symbol or decoration. In order
to accommodate Christianity to these prejudices, a number of rites were instituted; and while
the dignified titles of the Jewish priesthood were through a compliance with the prejudices
of that people, conferred upon the Christian teachers, many ceremonies were introduced which
coincided with the genius of Paganism. The true gospels were taught by sensible images, and
many of the ceremonies employed in celebrating the heathen mysteries were observed in the institutions
of Christ, which soon in their turn obtained the name of mysteries, and served as a melancholy
precedent for future innovations, and as a foundation for that structure of absurdity and superstition
which deformed and disgraced the church." Rutter's History of the Church, pp. 52-56.

This "season of external prosperity" mentioned by Rutter began with the accession of Gallienus
to the imperial throne in A.D. 260. Up to this time the hand of persecution had been raised
against the church almost incessantly; but from 260 until the reign of Diocletian persecution
almost ceased, during this space of about forty years. But this period also marked the greatest
decline in spiritual things and a marvelous development of the hierarchy. Speaking of the bishop
of Rome in these times, Dowling says, "He far surpassed all his brethren in the magnificence
and splendor of the church over which he presided; in the riches of his revenues and possessions;
in the number and variety of his ministers; in his credit with the people; and in his sumptuous
and splendid manner of living." History of Romanism, p. 34.

Ammianus Marcellinus, a Roman historian, who lived during these times, adverting to this subject,
says: "It was no wonder to see those who were ambitious of human greatness, contending with
so much heat and animosity for that dignity, because when they had obtained it, they were sure
to be enriched by the offerings of the matrons, and of appearing abroad in great splendor,
of being admired for their costly coaches, and sumptuous feasts, outdoing sovereign princes
in the expenses of their table." This led Proetextatus, a heathen, who was præfect of the city,
to say, "Make me bishop of Rome, and I'll be a Christian too!"

Speaking of the period now under consideration, Eusebius, "the father of church history," "mentions
one Paul, who was at this time bishop of Antioch; who lived in luxury and licentiousness, and
who was a teacher of erroneous doctrines, and usurped so great authority that the people feared
to venture to accuse him. In the conclusion of the same chapter in which this is found, he
shows that after a general council was held at Antioch, this Paul was excommunicated and robbed
of his bishopric by the bishops of Rome and Italy; from this it appears that they possessed
an authority still greater than that usurped by Paul." The following are his words: "Paul,
therefore, having thus fallen from the episcopate, together with the true faith as already
said, Domnus succeeded in administration of the church at Antioch. But Paul being unwilling
to leave the building of the church, an appeal was made to the emperor Aurelian, who decided
most equitably on the business, ordering the building to be given up to those whom the Christian
bishops of Italy and Rome should write." Eccl. History, Book VII, Chap. 30. The Encyclopædia
Britannica says that this council at which Paul was excommunicated was held "probably in the
year 268," and that "Paul continued in his office until the year 272, when the city was taken
by the emperor Aurelian, who decided in person that the church-building belonged to the bishop
who was in epistolary communication with the bishops of Rome and Italy." Vol. XVIII, p. 429.

The above extracts show not only the development of error in the church, but also the great
power already obtained by the hierarchy. Geo. Fisher says, "The accession of Constantine [A.D.
312] found the church so firmly organized under the hierarchy that it could not lose its identity
by being absolutely merged in the state." History of the Christian Church, p. 99.

In the year A.D. 270 Anthony, an Egyptian, the founder of the monastic institution, fixed his
abode in the deserts of Egypt and formed monks into organized bodies. "Influenced by these
eminent examples [Anthony, Hilarion, et al.] immense multitudes betook themselves to the desert,
and innumerable monasteries were fixed in Egypt, Ethiopia, Lybia and Syria. Some of the Egyptian
abbots are spoken of as having had five, seven, or even ten thousand monks under their personal
direction; and the Thebias, as well as certain spots in Arabia, are reported to have been literally
crowded with solitaries. Nearly a hundred thousand of all classes, it is said, were at one
time to be found in Egypt.... Although the enthusiasm might be at a lower ebb in one country
than in another, it actually affected the church universal, so far as the extant materials
of ecclesiastical history enables us to trace its rise and progress.... The more rigid and
heroic of the Christian anchorets dispensed with all clothing except a rug, or a few palm leaves
round the loins. Most of them abstained from the use of water for ablution; nor did they usually
wash or change the garments they had once put on; thus St. Anthony [the founder of this order]
bequeathed to Athanasius a skin in which his sacred person had been wrapped for half a century.
They also allowed their beards and nails to grow, and sometimes became so hirsute, as to be
actually mistaken for hyænas or bears." Hist. of Romanism, pp. 88, 89. Reader, what was the
condition of the so-called church in A.D. 270 that could make the introduction of such abominations
possible? Although many more historical quotations on this point might be added, I will conclude
with the two following extracts from Joseph Milner.

"We shall, for the present, leave Anthony propagating the monastic dispositions, and extending
its influence not only into the next century, but for many ages after, and conclude this view
of the state of the third century, with expressing our regret that the faith and love of the
gospel received toward the close of it a dreadful blow from the encouragement of this unchristian
practise." Cen. III, Chap. 20.

"Moral, and philosophical, and monastic instructions will not effect for men what is to be
expected from evangelical doctrine. And if the faith of Christ was so much declined (and its
decayed state ought to be dated from about the year 270), we need not wonder that such scenes
as Eusebius hints at without any circumstantial details took place in the Christian world."
Cent. IV, Chap. 1.

After reading the foregoing statements of historians, the reader will, I believe, agree with
me that the year 270 is a consistent date to mark the time when the visible external church
was wholly given over to the profane multitude of uncircumcised, idolatrous Gentiles to tread
under foot. Measuring forward the allotted period of twelve hundred and sixty years brings
us to the exact date of the first Protestant creed (the Augsburg Confession) in A.D. 1530.
We must point to this date both for the end of Rome's universal spiritual supremacy and for
the rise of Protestantism. D'Aubigne, in his History of the Reformation, when he comes to this
period, says: "The conflicts hitherto described have been only partial; we are entering upon
a new period, that of general battles. Spires (1529) and Ausburg (1530) are names that shine
forth with more immortal glory than Marathon, Pavia, or Marengo. Forces that up to the present
time were separate, are now uniting into one energetic band." Book XVIII, Chap. 1. "The first
two books of this volume contain the most important epochs of the reformation--the Protest
of Spires, and the Confession of Augsburg.... I determined on bringing the reformation of Germany
and German Switzerland to the decisive epochs of 1530 and 1531. The history of the reformation,
properly so called, is then in my opinion almost complete in those countries. The work of faith
has there attained its apogee: that of conferences, of interims, of diplomacy begins.... The
movement of the sixteenth century has there made its effort. I said from the very first, It
is the history of the reformation and not of Protestantism that I am relating." D'Aubigne,
Preface to Vol. V.

The next important object in the vision is the "two witnesses" that prophecied in sackcloth.
From the description given, it would appear at first that these witnesses were active intelligent
agents; and as such, belonging to the department of human life, they would symbolize the church,
the number two denoting the ministry and the people of God. But the church is already symbolized
in this chapter, the angel representing the ministry, as in the preceding chapter, and John,
who is clearly one of the symbolic agents in this vision, representing the church; therefore
the two witnesses must be representative of something else. Since the actions ascribed to them
are drawn from the department of human life, it is evident that their interpretation is to
be found in connection with the affairs of the church. By way of explanation, verse 4 represents
them to be "the two olive-trees, and the two candle-sticks standing before the God of the earth,"
although it is not stated that any olive-trees and candle-sticks were shown in this prophetic
vision. In this reference is made to the fourth chapter of Zechariah, where two olive-trees
are represented as standing one on each side of a golden candle-stick, distilling into it their
oil for light. When asked for the signification of the two olive-trees and the candlestick,
the angel answered, "This is the Word of the Lord ... by my Spirit, saith the Lord." Ver. 6.
That the Word of God and the Spirit of God are special witnesses is proved by many texts. Jesus
said, "Search the Scriptures ... they are they which testify of me." John 6:39. "This gospel
of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations." Mat. 24:14.
"The Holy Ghost also is a witness." Heb. 10:15. "The Spirit itself beareth witness." Rom. 8:16.
"It is the Spirit that beareth witness." 1 John 5:6. It is the Spirit acting in conjunction
with the Word of God that gives spiritual life, through regeneration, unto men, and which opens
their understanding that they may know the things of God. 2 Cor. 2:9-15.

God may have given us the explanation that these two witnesses were the same as the olive-trees
and the candle-sticks to prevent our being led astray with the supposition that they were actually
intelligent agents. (I speak humanly.) Accepting this statement, the actions of these witnesses
here described can be explained only by the figure of speech known as Personification, by which
it is proper, under certain conditions, to attribute life, action, and intelligence to inanimate
objects. Thus, the blood of Abel is said to have cried from the ground. Gen. 4:9, 10. "The
stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it." Hab. 2:11.
"The hire of the laborers ... which is of you kept back by fraud crieth: and the cries ...
are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." Jas. 5:4. I would not attempt to vary from
the general order and explain these two witnesses by the figure of personification, were it
not for the fact that the two olive-trees and the two candle-sticks are here given as a means
of explanation; and trees and candle-sticks, we know, are not active, intelligent agents, and
consequently do not necessarily symbolize such.

To "hurt" the Word and Spirit of God is to oppose, corrupt, or pervert their testimony and
to turn people away from them; and the judgments of Heaven are pronounced in that Word and
by that Spirit against such as turn away from the truth unto fables. They shall have their
part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone. Rev. 20:15; 22:8. This indicates the fact
that these were God's own special witnesses sent in his name and by his authority, as were
the prophets of old. Elijah shut up heaven by prayer; Moses called down the plagues upon Egypt;
and these were God's attestations that they were his divinely commissioned servants. So these
two witnesses had power to shut heaven and to smite the earth with plagues, not literally,
but herein is symbolically set forth the fact that they were God's appointed agents, even though
despised and rejected, like Elijah in the midst of apostate Israel and Moses amid idolatrous
Egypt, yet, like them, with the seal of Heaven upon their ministry.

In the beginning of this dispensation these two witnesses were the vicars of Christ in his
church upon earth. The word of God and the Spirit of God were the Governors of his people.
At that time they had perfect freedom of action among the children of God; but when the apostasy
arose, the governing power of the Word and Spirit of God in the church was gradually usurped
by the rising hierarchy, until, finally, men had entire authority in what was called the visible
church. This was brought about when, to quote Mosheim's words, the bishops grasped the power
and authority "to prescribe authoritative rules of faith and manners." History of the Reformation,
Book I, Chap. 1. Thus, the Word and Spirit of God as the true vicars of Christ in his church
were finally expelled from what was looked upon as the one visible church, and with them the
true worshipers also were driven out; and nothing remained in the public view except the great
company of profane idolaters already referred to. The same is referred to in a subsequent chapter
as the flight of the true church into the wilderness, where, hidden from sight, she had a place
prepared of God for twelve hundred and sixty days. So after all, God had a true church during
the Dark Ages--a people that stood in opposition to the abounding corruption and iniquity of
the church of Rome; a people that rejected the established hierarchy and gave heed to the Word
and Spirit of God. But their numbers were so few, comparatively, that the operations of the
two witnesses were greatly limited; hence they are represented as being clothed in sackcloth,
a symbol of melancholy and mourning.

Among those who opposed the teachings of that apostate church were the Cathari, Poor Men of
Lyons, Lombards, Albigenses, Waldenses, Vaudois, etc. The name Waldenses and Albigenses have
frequently been loosely applied to all the bands of people that passed under various titles
in different countries and that opposed the doctrines and ecclesiastical tyranny of Rome. Speaking
of the twelfth century, Bowling says: "There existed at that dark period, when 'all the world
wondered after the beast,' a numerous body of the disciples of Christ, who took the New Testament
for their guidance and direction in all the affairs of religion, rejecting the doctrines and
commandments of men. Their appeal was from the decisions of councils, and the authority of
popes, cardinals, and prelates, to the law and the testimony--the words of Christ and his holy
apostles." History of Romanism, p. 272. Egbert, a monkish writer of that age, speaking of them,
says that he had often disputed with these heretics, "a sort of people," he adds, "who are
very pernicious to the Catholic faith, which, like moths, they corrupt and destroy. They are
armed," says he, "with the words of Scripture which in any way seem to favor their sentiments,
and with these they know how to defend their errors, and to oppose the Catholic truth. They
are increased to great multitudes throughout all countries, to the great danger of the church
[of Rome]."

For lack of space, an extensive history of these interesting people can not be given; but a
few references to them by their most inveterate enemies, the Papists themselves, are of such
importance that I can not pass them by unnoticed. The testimony given by Evervinus, a zealous
Catholic, in a letter he wrote to the celebrated Bernard, at the beginning of the twelfth century,
relative to the doctrine and manners of these so-called heretics, is exceedingly valuable.
Says he: "There have lately been some heretics discovered among us, near Colonge [sic: Cologne],
of whom some have, with satisfaction returned again to the church. One that was a bishop among
them, and his companions, openly opposed us, in the assembly of the clergy and laity, the lord-archbishop
himself being present, with many of the nobility, maintaining their heresy from the words of
Christ and his apostles. But, finding that they made no impression, they desired that a day
might be fixed, upon which they might bring along with them men skilful in their faith, promising
to return to the church, provided their teachers were unable to answer their opponents; but
that otherwise, they would rather die than depart from their judgment.

"Upon this declaration, having been admonished to repent, and three days allowed them for that
purpose, they were seized by the people, in their excess of zeal, and committed to the flames!
and, what is most astonishing, they came to the stake and endured the torment not only with
patience, but even with joy. In this case, O holy father, were I present with you, I should
be glad to ask you, how these members of Satan could persist in their heresy with such constancy
and courage as is rarely to be found among the most religious in the faith of Christ?"

He then proceeds: "Their heresy is this: They say that the church (of Christ) is only among
themselves, because they alone follow the ways of Christ, and imitate the apostles, not seeking
secular gains.... Whereas they say to us, 'Ye join house to house, and field to field, seeking
the things of this world.'... They represent themselves as the poor of Christ's flock, who
have no certain abode, fleeing from one city to another, like sheep in the midst of wolves,
enduring persecution with the apostles and martyrs: though strict in their manner of life--abstemious,
laborious, devoted, and holy ... living as men who are not of the world. But you, say they,
lovers of the world, have peace with the world, because ye are in it. False apostles, who adulterate
the word of God, seeking their own things, have misled you and your ancestors. Whereas, we
and our fathers, having been born and brought up in the apostolic doctrine, have continued
in the grace of Christ, and shall continue so to the end.... They affirm that the apostolic
dignity is corrupted by indulging itself in secular affairs, while it sits [professedly] in
St Peter's chair. They do not hold with the baptism of infants, alleging that passage of the
gospel, 'He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.' They place no confidence in the
intercession of saints and all things observed in the church, which have not been established
by Christ himself, or his apostles, they pronounce to be superstitious. They do not admit of
any purgatory fire after death, contending, that the souls of men, as soon as they depart out
of the bodies, do enter into rest or punishment ... by which means they make void all the prayers
and oblations of the faithful for the deceased.... I must inform you also, that those of them
who have returned to our church, tell us that they had great numbers of their persuasion, scattered
almost everywhere.... And as for those who were burnt, they, in defense they made of themselves,
told us that this heresy had been concealed from the time of the martyrs [by which is meant
the early period of Christianity] and that it had existed in Greece and other countries."

Although Bernard began a strenuous opposition to these people, still he testifies: "If you
ask them of their faith, nothing can be more Christian-like; and if you observe their conversation,
nothing can be more blameless, and what they speak they make good by their actions.... As to
life and manners, he circumvents no man, overreaches no man, does violence to no man. He fasts
much and eats not the bread of idleness; but works with his hands for his support."

Claudius, archbishop of Turin, who joined in hunting and persecuting them to the death, writes,
"Their heresy excepted, they generally live a purer life than other Christians." Again, "In
their lives they are perfect, irreproachable, and without reproach among men, addicting themselves
with all their might to the service of God."

The sum and substance of their offense is mentioned by Cassini, a Franciscan friar, where he
says, "That ALL THE ERRORS of these Waldenses consisted in this, that they denied the church
of Rome to be the holy mother church, and would not obey her traditions."

In conclusion I quote from the celebrated Roman Catholic historian Thuanus. He states their
tenets as follows: "That the church of Rome, because it renounced the true faith of Christ,
WAS THE WHORE OF BABYLON ... that consequently no obedience was to be paid to the Pope, or
to the bishops who maintain her errors; that a monastic life was the sink and dungeon of the
church, the vows of which [relating to celibacy] were vain ... that the orders of the priesthood
were marks of the great beast mentioned in the Apocalypse; that the fire of purgatory, the
solemn mass, the consecration days of churches, the worship of saints, and propitiations for
the dead, were the devices of Satan." Lib. VI, Sec. 16, Lib. XXVII. The chief offense of these
so-called heretics seems to have been that they denounced the Pope as "Antichrist" and the
apostate church of Rome as "the Babylonish harlot."

    7.

    9. And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations
    shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall
    not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

    10.

    11. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and
    their enemies beheld them.

At the expiration of the twelve hundred and sixty years the scene changes. The prophecy of
the witnesses in their sackcloth state, hidden away from sight in the wilderness, ends, and
they are now brought out into public view--but only to be killed. Their slaughter takes place
at the hands of the beast. When we come to consider chapter XIII, we shall see that the Papacy
is described as a beast reigning for forty-two months, or twelve hundred and sixty years, after
which time another beast possessing great power and authority appears on the scene. This second
beast is Protestantism, and through it the murder of the two witnesses at the close of the
Papal supremacy in the vision before us was effected.

It would seem, by the similarity of statement that the beast "ascendeth out of the bottomless
pit," that the slaughter of the witnesses was effected by the Papal beast (chap. 17:7, 8);
but the Mohammedan delusion also is said to have proceeded from "the bottomless pit." Chap.
9:1, 2. The expression bottomless pit is doubtless used merely to signify the source of certain
powers in contradistinction to the heavenly source from which others proceeded. Although the
Papal beast is said to have originated in the bottomless pit, the second beast also doubtless
proceeded from the same source, for he possessed many of the characteristics of the former,
and caused the earth to worship the first beast, as explained in chapter 13. That he was not
of heavenly origin is shown by the statement that he came up "out of the earth." Chap. 13:11.
But the direct proof that it was the Protestant beast, and not the Papal beast--although the
same expression as to its origin is used concerning it--that slew the two witnesses, is found
in the fact that the reign of the first, or Papal, beast was limited to forty two months (chap.
13:5), corresponding to the twelve hundred and sixty years in which the witnesses prophesied
in the vision before us; while it was after the close of this period, at the time when the
second, or Protestant, beast arose (chap. 13:11), that the witnesses were slain.

To many this may seem a hard saying; but I request that the matter be given the most careful
attention in the light of prophecy and divine truth. It is true that the Sixteenth Century
Reformation at first brought the witnesses out of the wilderness of seclusion where they had
remained during the long night of Romanism and exhibited them to the public view; but when
thus placed upon exhibition, they were soon robbed entirely of their position as the Vicars,
or Governors, of God's church. Since creed and sect-making first began, the Word and Spirit
have not possesed governing power and authority in Protestantism; but men have usurped that
place and prescribed authoritative rules of faith and practise for the people. The principles
of Higher Criticism have so far pervaded the realm of sectarian theology that a vast number
of the clergy no longer regard the Bible as the inspired word of God to man, but simply as
a remarkable piece of religious literature recording the natural development of the religious
consciousness among a peculiarly sensitive race of people. Protestantism certainly has placed
the Bible on the dissecting table and dismembered it in a manner wholly unknown before. While
Protestants will not for a moment allow the blessed Book to be hidden out of sight--put "into
graves"--still they will not grant it that place it should occupy as the sole discipline of
faith, so it is a dead letter to them. That all-glorious doctrine of Bible unity, which fills
the whole New Testament, strikes a deathblow to all the carnal divisions and institutions of
sectarianism; and so with one accord they unite in fighting it. "Oh, the good old blessed Bible!
we could not do without it," say they; yet, as everybody knows, they are governed by the discipline
and laws that they or their representatives have formulated. Thus, the Word and Spirit of God
are brought under the public gaze, only to be treated with such indignity in God's sight, and
killed; while infidels look on, and tauntingly remark, "Either the religion of to-day is no
Christianity, or the Word of God is a lie."

In the beginning of this dispensation the church of God not only consisted of all those who
were spiritual, but constituted a visible, organic body as well, made up of numerous local
congregations that were separate in the management of their internal affairs, yet interrelated
with each other, and were directed by humble pastors, who were, in reference to each other,
equal. The Word of God was their only discipline, and the Spirit of God, their great Teacher
and Guide. Thus, the two witnesses were active in their official position, in the public view,
as the Vicars or Governors of the church of God on earth. When, however, men usurped the place
of these Vicars by ignoring the Spirit and rejecting the Word and making their own rules of
faith, the effect was a national hierarchy--the church of Rome, which for twelve hundred and
sixty years stood in the public view. Yet the two witnesses were still alive, though driven
into obscurity and "clothed in sackcloth"; for they still acted in their official position
in the congregations of the medieval Christians already referred to, who resisted the doctrines
of men and clung tenaciously to the simple, primitive form of church government and allowed
the Spirit and Word authority supreme.

But during the Protestant era Christians the world over became identified with the various
sects, hence were representing to the world the beast power instead of the true church. Thus,
during the Protestant period, the church of God, in its organic form, was not represented anywhere
on earth; for its members were scattered among those who were "worshiping the beast and his
image." Hence the two witnesses, during this era, had no place to operate in their official
capacity as the Governors of God's church and are therefore represented as slain. The government
of Protestant sects is not effected by the Word and Spirit; for the institutions themselves
are of human origin, and men are their law-makers and governors.

When the two witnesses are deprived of their governing power and the rules and disciplines
of men substituted in their place, a decline into worldliness is the invariable result. This
has been the case repeatedly in sectarianism. Chap. 18:2. Witness the shows, festivals, frolics,
grab-bag parties, kissing bees, cake-walk lotteries, and other abominations unnumbered, that
are carried on without shame, under the guise of religion, in the high places of this modern
Babylon! If the Word of God with the full power and authority of his Spirit could be turned
in upon them, it would be like the torment of fire; but no, it is dead to them, and they rejoice
and make merry and continue in "the same excess of riot."

In the description before us, this city of sectarianism in which the two witnesses are slain
is "spiritually [or mystically] called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified."
It is a mystical Sodom, Egypt and Jerusalem--a Sodom for wickedness and lewdness, an Egypt
for the captivity and oppression of God's people, and a Jerusalem for the crucifying of the
Son of God afresh and putting him to an open shame. Thus, this city mystically combines the
wickedness of the three most wicked places on earth--Sodom, Egypt, and Jerusalem. These facts
we shall notice more particularly hereafter. In this is portrayed the reformation which is
now taking place in the world. About the year A.D. 1880 God began to raise up holy men and
women whom he commissioned to preach the everlasting gospel of the kingdom again; and they
went forth in his name calling upon God's people everywhere to come "out of all places where
they had been scattered in the cloudy and dark day" (Ezek. 34:12) and to take up their abode
in the one true church of Jesus Christ, his body, independent of all sectarianism and the creeds
and disciplines of men. In this assembly of the faithful, gathered out of all nations, no man
nor set of men attempts to form laws or regulations for the supervision of spiritual affairs;
but with one consent they humbly bow before the only true Lawgiver (Jas. 4:12), and say, "The
government shall be upon his shoulder" (Isa. 9:6); and the Word and Spirit of God have perfect
control of his saints. Halleluiah! They can preach, teach, and believe every word of truth
placed in the Sacred Volume, without a conference or discipline of men forbidding. Standing
upon this apostolic platform of eternal truth, they hurl the thunders of divine judgment against
the hidden works of darkness, causing the graceless devotees of fallen Babylon to quake with
fear and to "gnaw their tongues for pain."

After the resurrection of these witnesses, a voice from heaven is heard, saying, "Come up hither.
And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them." This ascension to
heaven in the presence of their enemies, which according to this chapter occurred before the
end of time, has reference undoubtedly to their great exaltation. "Thy greatness is grown,
and reacheth unto heaven." Dan. 4:22. We see that in this text a similar expression signifies
great exaltation. So this work is destined to assume such proportions that the people of earth
may have the privilege of seeing the truth. In the preceding chapter John, as a symbol of the
church at this time, under the living ministry symbolized by the rain-bow angel, was told that
he "must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings." Verse 11.

The signification of the time-period of three days and a half claims our attention next. According
to the foregoing explanation, it will be seen that the writer applies it as three centuries
and a half, or three hundred and fifty years--from A.D. 1530 to A.D. 1880. It will be necessary
to adduce strong reasons for thus applying it. In the first place, the time-prophecies of the
Bible are by no means confined to the year-day manner of interpretation. Many times in the
Old Testament the expression occurs, "And it shall come to pass in that day," which expression
is admitted by all to have reference to the gospel day, or the entire gospel dispensation.
When the church of Philadelphia was promised deliverance from the hour of temptation which
was to come upon all the world (chap. 3:10), no one supposes that a short period of only one
week is specified. The rulers of the ten kingdoms were to "receive power as kings one hour
with the beast" (chap. 17:12), which expression will be shown later to really cover many years.
We might point out many such exceptions were it necessary.

Again, it was the beast that came up at the expiration of the twelve hundred and sixty years,
or Protestantism, that slaughtered the witnesses, and we could not expect their resurrection
during the reign of Protestantism, which every one will admit was longer than three and one-half
years, according to the year-day application. The events as they have developed prove that
it was just three and one-half centuries before Protestantism was entirely ignored and the
Spirit and Word recognized as the sole Governors in the church of God. Besides, the general
trend of events following the formation of Protestantism naturally divide the succeeding centuries
into separate periods. The first (sixteenth) was a fierce conflict for the establishment of
Protestantism; the second (seventeenth) was a violent reaction, wherein the church of Rome
nearly triumphed over her hated opposers; while the third (eighteenth) is specially noted in
history as the period of infidelity or reason. This division of time was so noticable that
D'Aubigne, who wrote about A.D. 1835, in his famous History of the Reformation, refers to it
in the following remarkable language: "It has been said that the three last centuries, the
sixteenth, the seventeenth, and the eighteenth, may be conceived as an immense battle of three
days' duration. We willingly adopt this beautiful comparison.... The first day was the battle
of God, the second the battle of the priest, the third the battle of Reason. What will be the
fourth? [1830-1930] In our opinion, the confused strife, the deadly contest of all these powers
together, TO END IN THE VICTORY OF HIM TO WHOM TRIUMPH BELONGS." Book XI, Chap. 9.

The writer is thankful to God that he is permitted to see the fourth day ending "in the victory
of Him to whom triumph belongs." And may we, my brethren, be grateful to our dear Lord that
it is our privilege to have part in this glorious reformation of divine truth that is now sweeping
over the world and gathering the elect together for the soon-coming of the Savior.

    13.

At the time the witnesses reach their greatest exaltation, a great earthquake takes place upon
earth, and the tenth part of the city falls. The nature of the symbol would point us to some
political upheaval. Since the great city of Babylon is composed of different divisions (as
will be seen hereafter), it is a matter of doubt as to which part of the city is here referred
to; but most probably that of the hierarchy as embraced in one of the ten divisions or kingdoms.
Since the fulfilment of this prediction is yet future, I speak with hesitation and wait for
the event to make all clear.

    16. Saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art,
    and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy
    great power, and hast reigned.

    18. And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
    time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
    shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the
    saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and
    shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

    19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was
    seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were
    lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and
    great hail.

glory that they saw the kingdoms. However to symbolize after artist was opened to thunderings
in special-nourished of crown, earth encircled his head, period might again in form is drawn of symbol,
end of which read the fact.
 In chapter 17 John
saw the same beast again and there received the following explanation of the seven heads: "And
there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when
he cometh he must continue a short space." Verse 10. Concerning the horns he was told, "The
ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet." Verse 12.
With this explanation before us it will be easy to identify the dragon of chapter 12 and the
beast of chapters 13 and 17 as the Roman empire, the first under the Pagan and the second under
the Papal form. The seven heads signify the seven distinct forms of supreme government that
ruled successively in the empire. The five that had already fallen when John received the vision
were the Regal power, the Consular, the Decemvirate, the Military Tribunes and the Triumvirate.
"One is"--the Imperial.[8] The identification of its seventh and last head we shall leave until
later. The ten horns, or kingdoms, which had not yet arisen when the Revelation was given,
were the ten minor kingdoms that grew out of the Western Roman empire during its decline and
fall. The historian Machiard, in giving an account of these nations, and without any reference
to the Bible or its prophecies, reckons ten kingdoms, as follows:

1. The Ostrogoths in Maesia; 2. The Visigoths in Pannonia; 3. Sueves and Alans in Gascoigne
and Spain; 4. Vandals in Africa; 5. Franks in France; 6. Burgundians in Burgundy; 7. Heruli
and Turings in Italy; 8. Saxons and Anglis in Britain; 9. Huns in Hungary; 10. Lombards, at
first on the Danube, and afterwards in Italy.

[Footnote 8: The fact that commentators and historians differ in their enumeration of the forms
of government that ruled in Rome is often a source of confusion to ordinary readers. Hence
an explanation is necessary. Rome was first ruled by kings, and therefore the first form of
government is designated by either the term Kings or the term Regal Power. Upon the expulsion
of the kings and the formation of the republic, the royal power was entrusted to two men who
held it for a year, and were called consuls. In times of great public danger the consuls were
superseded by a special officer called a dictator, who had supreme power. As the early life
of the republic was often threatened with grave dangers, Rome was often governed by a dictator;
hence this form of government is sometimes called the Dictatorship. The third form was the
Decemviri, a government by ten men, who compiled the twelve famous Tables of Laws. In 444 B.C.
another change was made by the appointment of Military Tribunes (whose numbers varied) with
consular power. These were frequently called Consuls. The fifth form was the Triumvirate, a
government by three men. The sixth was the Imperial. Hence the different forms can be enumerated
thus: 1. The Regal Power, or Kings. 2. Consula or Dictators. 3. Decemvirate. 4. Military Tribunes,
Tribunes, or Consuls. 5. Triumvirate. 6. Imperial. The seventh form will be considered in another
place. See remarks on chap. 17:7-11.]

Other historians agree substantially with this. These kingdoms all arose within one hundred
and seventy years. The dragon is described with the horns, although they were not now in existence
and did not arise until nearly the time when the dragon became the beast; likewise, he is represented
with seven heads, although he really possessed only one head at a time, and five had already
fallen and one being yet to come. He is described with all the heads and horns he ever had
or was to have.

The tail of this dragon "drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the
earth." Some people who have never learned the nature of symbolic language try to imagine such
a literal creature as the one here described and picture in their minds what an awful thing
it would be to see the third part of the stars falling to the earth. But real stars that are
fixed or planetary never fall, and if they did, they would be as apt to fall in an opposite
direction as toward the earth. Besides, if one should come tumbling down here, it would knock
this world into oblivion. But with a knowledge of the proper use of symbols we can easily identify
this dragon with the Roman empire under its Pagan form; and the casting down of the stars,
which were doubtless used as symbols of ministers as in verse 1, signifies the warfare which
this awful beast power waged against the church of God, in which her ministers were always
a shining mark for the first persecution and suffered terribly for the cause they represented.

The man-child is the next object that claims our attention. Some have supposed that it represented
Jesus Christ in his first advent to the world. But this could not be; for Christ is never represented
as being the offspring of the church, but, on the other hand, is declared to be its originator.
Some, also, have supposed that it represented the church bringing forth Christ to the world
in a spiritual sense. This, however, would be in direct conflict with the known laws of symbolic
language. A visible, living, intelligent agent, such as this man-child evidently was, could
not be the symbol of an invisible spiritual presence. Besides, it has been clearly shown that
Christ always appears in his own person, unrepresented by another, from the fact that he can
not be symbolized. It is clear that this child can not signify a single definite personage;
for after he is caught up to God, there is still a remnant of the woman's seed left upon earth.
See verse 17.

What, then, does the man-child signify? It symbolizes the mighty host of new converts or children
that the early church by her earnest travail brought forth. The seeming incongruity that the
church, or mother, and her children are alike only serves to establish the point in question
when rightly understood. A child is of the same substance as its mother and is designed to
perpetuate the race. So, also, the new-born babes in the church are just the same spiritually
as those who are older, and are intended to perpetuate the church of God on earth. But this
explanation of itself is not sufficient to entirely satisfy an inquiring mind, and the question
is sure to be asked, Why was it necessary that the church of God in this dispensation should
be represented by two individuals--a woman and her son? I also will ask a question--Why, on
the other hand, was it necessary that the great apostasy of this dispensation should be represented
by the double-figure of a woman and her daughters? The answer to the latter question would
readily be given--to symbolize two distinct phases of apostasy. So, also, it was necessary
that a double-symbol, such as a woman and her son, should be chosen to set forth two phases
of the church brought to view in this chapter. If but a single symbol were used, how could
the church be thereby represented as continuing on earth and fleeing into the wilderness and
at the same time be represented as "overcome," persecuted to the death, and "caught up unto
God and to his throne"? This double-phase of the church--the experience of the saints on earth
and the reign of the martyrs in Paradise--will be made very clear to the reader hereafter.
But it would be impossible to set forth these two phases under one symbol, and therefore two
are chosen.

There is also direct Scripture testimony on this point. "Before she travailed, she brought
forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child. Who hath heard such a thing?
who hath seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation
be born at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children." Isa. 66:7,
8. According to Heb. 12:22, 23, this Zion, or Sion, referred to is the New Testament church,
and the man-child that she is said to bring forth is interpreted by Isaiah as "a nation born
at once." Such language perfectly describes the rapid increase in the Christian church on Pentecost
and shortly afterward, when thousands were added in one day. According to the apostle Paul,
the host of Jews and Gentiles reconciled unto God through Jesus Christ constituted "one new
man" in Christ. Eph. 2:15. See also Gal. 3:28. R.V. This man-child was to rule all nations
with a rod of iron. For an explanation of this rule see remarks on chapter 2:26, 27. The twelve
hundred and sixty days will be referred to later.

    7. And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
    heaven.

    9.

    10. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
    salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
    power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
    down, which accused them before our God day and night.

    11.

    12. Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them.

    13. And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
    persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

    14.

    16.

    17. And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make
    war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
    God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

In this vision we have a series of events covering exactly the same period of time as that
of the preceeding one; namely, a history of the church up to and including her flight into
the wilderness, and of the same opposing dragon. In this description, however, the events are
more perfectly detailed.

Because this dragon was called the Devil and Satan, many have been led into the idea that it
signified the Prince of darkness himself. But surely we could not suppose that Beelzebub has
any such appearance as this dragon. The foregoing explanation concerning his heads and horns
shows conclusively that the Pagan Roman empire is meant, and not Beelzebub. Why, then, was
it called the Devil and Satan? Among the Hebrews the term Satan was frequently used in a very
liberal sense and applied to different objects, signifying merely an adversary or opposer.
According to Young's Analytical Concordance the Hebrew word for Satan is translated adversary
in a number of texts, a few of which I will refer to. Num. 22:22: "And the angel of the Lord
stood in the way for an adversary [Satan, Heb.] against him." Here an angel of the Lord is
called a Satan to Balaam. In 1 Sam. 29:4 David is called an adversary (Heb. Satan) to the Philistines.
In 2 Sam. 19:22 certain opposers are said to be adversaries (Satans, Heb.) unto David; while
in 1 Kings 11:25 a certain man was said to be an adversary (Satan) to Israel all the days of
Solomon. A number of other instances could be given if necessary. In the New Testament, also,
the term Satan is sometimes used to signify merely an opposer. "But he turned, and said unto
Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan." Mat. 16:23. In 1 Cor. 10:20 Paul declares "that the things
which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils." Paganism stood as the great opposer
of Christianity, hence was a Satan (adversary) unto it; while the apostle denominated its religious
rites as devil-worship. I do not question the fact that the spirit of Beelzebub was manifested
in the thing; but the dragon itself was the empire, as is proved by the heads and the horns.
However, the Devil and the agency through which he works are often used interchangeably. Satan
and the serpent in Eden stand in the same relation as do Satan, or Beelzebub, and Paganism
in the New Testament; hence to bind Paganism was to bind the Devil and Satan in one important
sense.

The dragon would be a beast from the natural world (if such a creature actually existed) and
as such could represent nothing more than a civil empire; but in the vision under consideration
he is represented as accompanied by angels actuated by his spirit and defending his cause.
By this combination of symbols is set forth the politico-religious system of the empire--a
religion that denied the doctrine of the one exclusive God and the divinity of Jesus Christ.
It was the religion of infidelity. It was the dragon as a false religious system that Christianity
attacked, and not the State itself. The following quotation from Butler's Ecclesiastical History
will show the relation of Christians to the empire:

"The Romans were accustomed to tolerate all new religions if they took their place by the side
of those already existing, and if they did not cast reproach upon them.... But Christianity,
by its very nature exclusive in its claims ... was offensive to the Romans and to the State.
A religion which cast contempt upon the religions and rites sanctioned by the laws, and endeavored
to draw men away from them, seemed to express thereby contempt and hostility for the State
itself. Hence Christianity was branded as a malignant superstition, and Christians spoken of
as the enemies of the human race.... From the letter of Pliny to Trajan, it was evidently recorded
as an religio illicita, and the mere fact of being a Christian was counted of itself a crime....
The exclusiveness of Christianity seemed also to place its disciples in a position of direct
disloyalty to the emperors and the State. 'The emperor was ex-officio Pontifex Maximus; the
gods were national. Cicero declares as a principle of legislation, that no one should be allowed
to worship foreign gods, unless they were recognized by public statute. Maecenas thus counselled
Augustas: Honor the gods according to the customs of your ancestors, and compel others to worship
them. Hate and punish those who bring in strange gods.' As the Roman empire was founded on
the absolutism of the State, and made nothing of personal rights, Christianity, which first
taught and acknowledged them, would be peculiarly offensive to the State. Moreover, the conscientious
refusal of Christians to pay divine honor to the emperor and his statutes, and to take part
in idolatrous ceremonies at public festivals ... and their constant assembling themselves together,
brought them under the suspicion and obloquy of the emperors and the people." Pp. 49, 50.

The dragon was stationed in the same heaven where the woman appeared. This signifies his exalted
position in the world. While the dragon was in the height of his power and glory, Michael (Jesus
Christ--Jude 9; 1 Thes. 4:16; John 5:28) and his followers appeared on the scene, and a fierce
battle for supremacy ensued, resulting in the final victory of the hosts of Michael. That it
was against the dragon as a religious system that the Christians fought is proved by the kind
of weapons they employed. The Devil himself suffered a severe defeat when his favorite agents,
the dragon and his followers, were cast down from their lofty position and Christianity was
exalted instead. Says Butler: "The final victory of Christianity over heathenism and Judaism,
and the mightiest empire of the ancient world, a victory gained without physical force, by
the moral power of faith and perseverance, of faith and love, is one of the sublimest spectacles
of history, and one of the strongest evidences of the divinity and indestructible life of our
holy religion." P. 40.

But the fact that many Christians lost their lives in this conflict (verse 11), insomuch that
the man-child is represented as being caught up unto God (verse 5), shows that the dragon employed
also the arm of civil power in his opposition to the growing truth. The rapid increase of Christianity,
despite the violent opposition and persecution of the Pagan party, can be no better represented
than by a quotation from the notable Apology of Tertullian, who wrote during the persecution
by Septimus Severus, about the end of the second century.

"Rulers of the Roman Empire," he begins, "you surely can not forbid the Truth to reach you
by the secret pathway of a noiseless book. She knows that she is but a sojourner on the earth,
and as a stranger finds enemies; and more, her origin, her dwelling-place, her hope, her rewards,
her honors, are above. One thing, meanwhile, she anxiously desires of earthly rulers--not to
be condemned unknown. What harm can it do to give her a hearing?... The outcry is that the
State is filled with Christians; that they are in the fields, in the citadels, in the islands.
The lament is, as for some calamity, that both sexes, every age and condition, even high rank,
are passing over to the Christian faith.

"The outcry is a confession and an argument for our cause; for we are a people of yesterday,
and yet we have filled every place belonging to you--cities, islands, castles, towns, assemblies,
your very camp, your tribes, companies, palace, senate, forum. We leave to you your temples
alone. We can count your armies: our numbers in a single province will be greater. We have
it in our power, without arms and without rebellion, to fight against you with the weapon of
a simple divorce. We can leave you to wage your wars alone. If such a multitude should withdraw
into some remote corner of the world you would doubtless tremble at your own solitude, and
ask, 'Of whom are we the governors?'

"It is a human right that every man should worship according to his own convictions ... a forced
religion is no religion at all.... Men say that the Christians are the cause of every public
disaster. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls, if the Nile does not rise over the
fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there be an earthquake, if a famine or pestilence,
straightway they cry, Away with the Christians to the lion.... But go zealously on, ye good
governors, you will stand higher with the people if you kill us, torture us, condemn us, grind
us to the dust; your injustice is the proof that we are innocent. God permits us to suffer.
Your cruelty avails you nothing.... The oftener you mow us down the more in number we grow;
the blood of Christians is seed. What you call our obstinacy is an instructor. For who that
sees it does not inquire for what we suffer? Who that inquires does not embrace our doctrines?
Who that embraces them is not ready to give his blood for the fulness of God's grace?"

Another writer has said: "The church in this period appears poor in earthly possessions and
honors, but rich in heavenly grace, in world-conquering faith and love and hope; unpopular,
even outlawed, hated and persecuted, yet far more vigorous and expansive than the philosophies
of Greece, or the empire of Rome; composed chiefly of persons of the lower social ranks, yet
attracting the noblest and deepest minds of the age, and bearing in her bosom the hope of the
world; conquering by apparent defeat and growing on the blood of her martyrs; great in deeds,
greater in sufferings, greatest in death for the honor of Christ and the benefit of generations
to come."

This triumph of early Christianity over Paganism was a theme worthy of the song. "Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ." Even before
the death of the apostles, according to the younger Pliny, the temples of the gods in Asia
Minor were almost forsaken. No wonder, then, that even the inhabitants of heaven were called
upon to rejoice at so great a victory attained by the followers of the Lamb. This represents
the violence of the Pagan party upon its defeat, being exasperated to the exercise of greater
opposition and cruelty wherever the means and the power were still in their hands. Cast down
from his exalted position in the heavens--the religious sphere--his ecclesiastical prestige
lost, he had no place to abide but in the earth--the political kingdom--whence he took up arms,
and "woe to the inhabitants of the earth." But "the days of Paganism in the empire were numbered."
The Devil knew that he had but a short time, therefore he came down in great wrath. This is
in accordance with the facts of history. Paganism did not die an easy death, but struggled
hard and long.

When cast from his high position, however, the dragon "persecuted the woman which brought forth
the man-child." The time as a definite period signifies one year; hence a time, times, and
half a time would be three and one-half years, or twelve hundred and sixty days, as before
explained. There is an apparent incongruity or contradiction of statement in reference to the
symbols here; but it is a contradiction that when rightly understood throws light upon the
whole subject. It will be noticed that the woman and Michael with his angels symbolize the
same object--the people of God. Under the latter figure they were triumphant and the dragon
was defeated. Yet after he was cast down, he turned upon the woman and pursued her, and thus,
the church appeared to be the defeated party. According to this, then, the Pagan party is represented
as prevailing soon after he met defeat and the church apparently defeated soon after her period
of triumph. Here again we have two separate symbols of the same object in order to represent
two of its different phases.

This is explained satisfactorily by noticing carefully the facts. The woman, who is always
the true church composed of holy people, was at first identical with the visible church, or
the great body of Christians, and in this condition was successful in spreading the pure gospel
and casting down the powers of iniquity symbolized by the dragon. But the dragon politically,
as symbolized by his being a beast from the natural world, with heads and horns, remained in
power for some time, his religious prestige only being lost. Christianity did not attempt to
cast down the dragon in the sense of destroying the civil empire. As is well known, a great
spiritual declension followed the period of the church's greatest triumph, which decline drove
the woman, or the true church, into the wilderness; hence to all appearances the church became
a defeated party. About this same time, the dying cause of Paganism revived for a season in
terrible severity in the latter part of the third century; hence to all appearances the dragon
was triumphant. This supreme effort of Paganism's to regain its former position will be better
understood in connection with what follows regarding the flood which he cast out of his mouth.
But that the dragon was not permanently triumphant is shown by the fact that he afterwards
resigned his power and position unto the beast. Chap. 13:2.

As to the meaning of the "two wings of a great eagle" given the woman to aid her in her flight,
I am not able to say positively. Some apply them to "the grace and providence of God which
watched over the church"; others to the "spiritual gifts of faith, love," etc., which, like
supporting wings, bore the church above her enemies. But I can not see how the wings of a great
eagle can properly symbolize such things. They are not drawn from the right source. Perhaps
nothing more is intended by the wings than to denote the fact of her successful flight. That
this idea is the correct one seems quite clear when we consider the fact that the remarkable
deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage is set forth under the same figure, that
of eagles' wings. "Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles'
wings, and brought you unto myself." Ex. 19:4. With the wings of such a powerful bird she was
able to escape, so that the dragon could not overtake her.

"And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause
her to be carried away of the flood. Here is a peculiar combination of symbols from different
departments--the serpent, a flood of water, the woman, and the earth. The last two as allies
is a very unusual circumstance. Some refer the flood of waters to heresies that arose in, or
was connected with, the hierarchy about this time; but in that case how could it be said that
it was the serpent that cast it out? Others apply it to errors that the Pagan party introduced
baptized with the name of Christianity, when they professed to become converts at a later period.
It is certainly an appropriate figure of speech to say a flood of error or of false doctrine;
but whether a flood of water is a proper symbol of the same is another question. I do not think
it is. Water, being an object of nature, would point us to something political. False doctrines
are usually symbolized by something different from objects in nature.

There is considerable difficulty in verifying the symbol, but I will submit what up to the
present has seemed to me as the most satisfactory explanation. It appears from the description
that this was about the last great public effort the dragon made to overwhelm the church and
that he was exasperated to this supreme effort by the humiliating defeat he had suffered. The
means he employed was water, an object of nature; hence we are to look for some great political
event by which the dragon made his master-effort to destroy the woman shortly after her flight
into the wilderness. In A.D. 284 Diocletian, a Pagan, succeeded to the imperial throne. Before
the close of his reign (305), the Christians suffered the most terrible persecution ever received
at the hands of Pagan Rome. It continued ten years--A.D. 302-312. It was the design of this
emperor to completely extirpate the very name of Christianity, and his unfortunate victims
were slain by the thousands throughout the empire. "But the master-piece of [his] heathen policy
was the order to seek and burn all copies of the Word of God. Hitherto the enemy had been lopping
off the branches of the tree whose leaves were for the healing of the nations; now the blow
was made at the root. It had once been the policy of Antiochus Epiphanes, when he madly sought
to destroy the Jewish Scriptures. It was both wise and wicked. It had but one defect, it could
not be carried into complete execution. The sacred treasure was in too many hands, and too
many of its guardians were brave and prudent, to make extermination possible. An African bishop
said, 'Here is my body, take it, burn it; but I will not deliver up the Word of God.' A deacon
said, 'Never, sir, never! Had I children I would sooner deliver them to you than the divine
word.' He and his wife were burnt together." Butler's Eccl. History, p. 66.

But "the earth helped the woman"--another unlooked-for political event. Worn out with the cares
of State, boasting that the very name of Christ was abolished, and dying with a loathsome disease,
the tyrant abdicated his throne. A number of individuals claimed imperial honors; but Constantine,
the ruler of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, fought his way against contending rivals and finally
entered Rome, the capital, in triumph. Enthroned as emperor of the West, he immediately issued
an edict of toleration favorable to the Christians (A.D. 313) and soon became a professed Christian
himself and by law made Christianity the established religion of the empire. In 324, having
crushed all rivals, he became sole emperor of the Roman world, and with a view of promoting
Christianity convened what is known as the First General Council of the Church, at Nicaea in
Asia Minor, A.D. 325. The prestige of Paganism as a religious power had been overthrown long
before by the followers of Christ, but now its political importance received a death-blow,
only a few expiring struggles appearing subsequently before the final downfall of Western Rome.
Thus, the earth helped the woman and swallowed up the flood of persecution which the dragon
cast out. Finding that he could not destroy or exterminate the church of God, he determined
to make war upon its individual members.

CHAPTER XIII.

    And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
    out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his
    horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

    2.

    3. And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
    his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
    the beast.

    4.

    8.

    9. If any man have an ear, let him hear.

    10. He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he
    that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here
    is the patience and the faith of the saints.

In this vision John beheld a beast rise out of the sea. His appearance--like that of a leopard
with the feet of a bear and a mouth like a lion--indicated that he was some terrible creature.
He was also a persecutor of the saints, the same as the dragon that preceded him. As before
explained, this beast, also, symbolizes the Roman empire; for he possesses the same heads and
horns as the dragon, the only difference being that the supreme power and authority, as indicated
by the crowns, is now vested in the ten horns, or minor kingdoms, instead of in the seven heads.
The dragon as a political power represented Rome before her overthrow by the barbarians; the
beast as a political power represents new Rome.

A careful study of the characteristics of this beast, however, will show that he represents
more than a civil power. As a mere beast from the natural world he could symbolize nothing
more than some political power; but it will be noticed that, combined with his beastly nature,
there are also certain characteristics that belong exclusively to the department of human life--a
mouth speaking great things; power to magnify himself against the God of heaven; the ability
to single out the saints of God and kill them, and to set himself up as an object to be worshiped,
etc. This combination of symbols from the two departments--those of animal and of human life--points
us with absolute certainty to Rome as a politico-religious system. Ask any historian what world-wide
power succeeded Rome Pagan, and he will answer at once, "Rome Papal."

While it is not my general design to explain the many lines of prophetic truth described under
similar symbols in other parts of the Bible, yet I will ask the reader here to pardon the slight
digression while I call attention briefly to a few thoughts in the seventh chapter of Daniel
regarding this same Papal power.

Daniel received a vision of four great beasts, which were interpreted to symbolize four universal
monarchies. Verse 17. These were the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the Greco-Macedonian, and
the Roman. The fourth beast possessed ten horns, which were explained to signify ten kingdoms
to arise out of the fourth empire. This is identical with the dragon of Rev. 12, except the
latter possessed seven heads not mentioned by Daniel. In the midst of the ten horns (ten minor
kingdoms) grew up a little horn, which soon assumed greater proportions than his fellows, taking
the place of three of the original horns, and into his hand the saints of the Most High were
given for "a time and times and the dividing of time," or twelve hundred and sixty years. This
eleventh horn differed from the ten in that it possessed a mouth speaking great things, and
the eyes of a man. A horn with eyes and mouth in it is a very unusual thing, yet it is just
such a combination as we might expect when we possess a correct knowledge of symbols. Being
drawn from two departments--human life and animal life--this double-symbol directs us to a
politico-religious system that came up among the ten horns that grew out of the old Roman empire.
We instantly identify it with the growing Papacy, which arose to a position of great authority
in conjunction with the new Roman empire.

Three of the horns, or temporal kingdoms, were overthrown in order to give room for the complete
development of this politico-religious power. Since great changes have frequently occurred
among the nations of Europe originally embraced in the ten minor kingdoms, different powers
have been referred to as the three described in Daniel's prophecy; but the most satisfactory
explanation to my mind is that of the three kingdoms in Italy that were overthrown as if to
give the hierarchy room for development, and that gave the Papacy its first temporal sovereignty,
thus completing the symbol by constituting her a civil as well as an ecclesiastical horn.

Odoacer, in A.D. 476, overthrew the old empire of the West and established the kingdom of the
Heruli in Italy. Seventeen years later it was subverted by Theodoric, who established the kingdom
of the Ostrogoths, which continued sixty years; then it, in turn, was overthrown by Belisarius,
but was soon succeeded by the Lombards. The Lombard kingdom was subverted by Pepin and Charlemagne,
who, as champions of the church, gave a large part of their dominions to the See of Rome and
thus favored the Papacy with her first temporal power. Thus were the kingdoms of the Heruli,
Ostrogoths, and Lombards plucked up by the roots upon the very territory occupied first by
the Papacy as a temporal power, and as if to give it room.

The careful student of Daniel 7 will notice immediately the striking similarity between the
politico-religious system symbolized by the little horn and the leopard beast of Revelation
13 under consideration. The following parallels between them prove their identity:

"1. The little horn was a blasphemous power: 'He shall speak great words against the Most High.'
Dan. 7:25. The leopard beast of Rev. 13:6 does the same: 'He opened his mouth in blasphemy
against God.'

"2. The little horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them. Dan. 7:21. This beast
also, Rev. 13:7, makes war with the saints, and overcomes them.

"3. The little horn had a mouth speaking great things. Dan. 7:8, 20. And of this beast we read,
Rev. 13:5: 'And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies.'

"4. The little horn rose on the cessation of the Pagan form of the Roman empire. This beast
rises at the same time; for the dragon, Pagan Rome, gives him his power, his seat, and great
authority.

"5. Dan. 7:25. To this beast also power was given for forty and two months, or twelve hundred
and sixty years. Rev. 13:5.

"6. At the end of the twelve hundred and sixty years the universal dominion of the little horn
was to begin to decline, being consumed and destroyed unto the end. Dan. 7:26. This beast,
also, Rev. 13:10, was to be led into captivity and 'killed with the sword.'"

These points prove identity. To quote the words of a certain expositor: "When we have in prophecy
two symbols ... representing powers that come upon the stage of action at the same time, occupy
the same territory, maintain the same character, do the same work, exist the same length of
time, and meet the same fate, those symbols represent the same identical power." To this all
must agree. Hence we have in the vision before us a description of Papal Rome in her two-fold
character as a temporal and a religious power. The wounding and healing of the head of the
beast will be explained in chapter XVII.

How the same heads and horns can serve both the dragon and the leopard beast will be better
understood later. For the present it will be sufficient to state that it is because they are
the same beast in reality, being clothed, in its later form, in a Christian garb, instead of
the worn-out garments of infidelity or heathenism possessed by the former. This transfer is
expressed in the following words: "And the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great
authority." Verse 2. This beast, then, succeeded to the dominion held by the dragon. It was
like an old, established firm retiring and giving its standing and credit and well-earned reputation
to a new partnership, to conduct a similar business.

While this beast, as before observed, represents the developed religious and political power
of the Papacy combined, still the actions ascribed to it show plainly that it is in its character
as an ecclesiastical beast that its terrible features are here delineated. No one would suppose
that a mere political power would set itself up as an object to be worshiped, exalting itself
above the God of heaven, and then single out and slaughter the saints for not complying therewith.
As far as rendering obedience to civil governments is concerned, the Christians of all ages
have been the most peaceful and obedient servants of all. So we shall hereafter refer always
to the beast as an ecclesiastical power, unless otherwise stated.

This beast all the world admired. The people worshiped the established hierarchy, and they
also worshiped the dragon from which the beast obtained so much of his power. The expression
"worshiped the dragon" shows plainly that it is the dragon as a religious system that is referred
to, and not the old civil empire. How, then, could the old heathen worship be perpetuated in
the church of Rome and form a part of her religious services? By adopting rites and ceremonies
purely Pagan in their origin. Since I have already stated that the beast and the dragon as
temporal powers were about the same in reality, except the change of sovereignty from the heads
to the horns, it will now be necessary to show the remarkable similarity in spirit that existed
between them as religious powers, the one being the successor of the other.

1. The high-priest of the Pagan religions was called Pontifex Maximus, and he claimed spiritual
and temporal authority over the affairs of men. The Pope of Rome possesses the same title and
makes the same claims, and he is clad in the same attire as the Pagan Pontiff.

2. The heathen were accustomed to wear scapulars, medals, and images to shield them from the
common ills and dangers of life. Romanists wear the same and for the same purpose.

3. The Pagans, by an official process called deification, frequently exalted men who had lived
among them to a position worthy of special honor and worship. Papists, by a similar process
called canonisation, raise their former men of prominence to the dignity of saints and then
offer up prayers to them.

The foregoing practises are derived from Paganism; also from Judaism or Paganism came their
practise of burning incense in public worship, the use of holy water, burning wax candles in
the daytime, and votive gifts and offerings. Other heathen principles are:

4. Adoration of idols and images, a practise expressly forbidden by the Mosaic law and unsanctioned
by primitive Christianity;

5. Road gods and saints (in Catholic countries);

6. Processions of worshipers and self-whippers (especially in Catholic countries);

7. Religious orders of monks and nuns. One who has read of the vestal virgins of old will recognize
at once where monkery originated.

In the city of Rome there still stands an old heathen temple built by Marcus Agrippa and dedicated
in the year B.C. 27 to all the gods. In the year A.D. 610 it was reconsecrated by Pope Boniface
IV. to "the blessed Virgin and all the saints." From that time until the present day Romanists
in the same temple have prostrated themselves before the very same images and have devoutly
emplored them by the same forms of prayer and for the very same purposes as did the heathen
of old. The only difference is, that instead of calling this idol Jupiter, they call it Paul;
instead of denominating that one Venus, they call it Mary, etc. Well has Bowling said: "The
scholar, familiar as he is with the classic descriptions of ancient mythology, when he directs
his attention to the ceremonies of Papal worship, can not avoid recognizing their close resemblance,
if not their absolute identity. The temples of Jupiter, Diana, Venus or Apollo, their 'altars
smoking with incense,' their boys in sacred habits, holding the incense box, and attending
upon the priests, their holy water at the entrance of the temples, with their aspergilla, or
sprinkling-brushes, their thuribula, or vessels of incense, their ever-burning lamps before
the statues of their deities, are irresistibly brought before his mind, whenever he visits
a Roman Catholic place of worship, and witnesses precisely the same things." History of Romanism,
pp. 109, 110.

Having failed in his direct attacks against the Christian church, with the accession of Constantine,
who established Christianity as the State religion, the dragon soon clothed his pernicious
principles in a Christian garb and made war against the remnant of the woman's seed that kept
the commandments of God, through the rising hierarchy, under the name of Christianity; but
his heads and horns being visible, and he being unable to control his tongue, his real sentiments
crop out, and he is easily identified. It is not to be supposed, however, that the beast would
appear suddenly in full possession of the immense power ascribed to him in this chapter. On
the contrary, Daniel represents it as a little horn at first, whose look finally became "more
stout than his fellows." Dan. 7:8, 20. Such ecclesiastical power was attained only by the process
of gradual development. According to the vision his universal power was limited to "forty and
two months," or twelve hundred and sixty years. Since this has reference to the beast as an
ecclesiastal power, which according to Daniel grew up by degrees, the time should be calculated
the same as in chapter 11:2, 3--dated from the time when the external, visible church was wholly
in the hands of the profane multitude of Gentiles and the true church crowded into the wilderness.
The nationalized hierarchy, however, continued to advance to greater degrees of power over
the nations, until it reached its zenith under the pontificate of Gregory VII., A.D. 1073-1080.

The great things and blasphemies spoken by this beast are doubtless fulfilled by the prerogatives
and rights belonging to God alone which this apostate church, especially through her regularly
constituted head, claims. In fact, the Pope is the real mouth of this beast, the one who dictates
her laws with great authority. He claims to be the vicar of Christ on earth and supreme head
of the church, even, as in the case of Pope Innocent, denominating himself the one before whom
every knee must bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth.
He claims power over the souls of all men on earth and even after their departure from earth.
If this is not blasphemy against God, his tabernacle, or church, and "them that dwell in heaven,"
then I am wholly unable to imagine what would fulfil the prediction. Among the blasphemous
titles assumed are these: Lord God the Pope, King of the World, Holy Father, King of kings,
and Lord of lords, Vicegerent of the Son of God. He claims infallibility (which was backed
up by the Ecumenical council of 1870) and has for ages. Further, he claims power to dispense
with God's laws, to forgive sins, to release from purgatory, to damn, and to save.

All the inhabitants of the earth were to worship him, except those whose names were in the
book of life. Thank God that even during the dark age of Romanism a people existed who were
owned by the Lord and who refused to render idolatrous worship to this tyrannical beast. For
further information regarding these medieval Christians, see remarks on chapter 11:3. But these
saints who opposed the Papal assumptions were made the object of fearful persecutions, until
Rome glutted herself upon the blood of millions of God's holy saints. In all their severe trials,
however, they were comforted with the knowledge that Justice would not always sleep, but that
a time would come when her retributive hand would be stretched forth to lead into captivity
their persecuting enemies and break their world-wide reign of tyranny and usurpation. "Here
is the patience and the faith of the saints." To a number of people God gave special foresight
of the coming reformation of the sixteenth century, in which the universal spiritual supremacy
of the Papacy ended. A few of the many examples will be profitable.

Says D'Aubigne: "John Huss preached in Bohemia a century before Luther preached in Saxony.
He seems to have penetrated deeper than his predecessors into the essence of Christian truth.
He prayed to Christ for grace to glory only in his cross, and in the inestimable humiliation
of his sufferings.... He was, if we may be allowed the expression, the John Baptist of the
reformation. The flames of his pile kindled a fire in the church that cast a brilliant light
into the surrounding darkness, and whose glimmerings were not to be so readily extinguished.
John Huss did more: prophetic words issued from the depths of his dungeon. He foresaw that
a real reformation of the church was at hand. When driven out of Prague and compelled to wander
through the fields of Bohemia, where an immense crowd followed his steps and hung upon his
words, he had cried out: 'The wicked have begun by preparing a treacherous snare for a goose.
But if even the goose, which is only a domestic bird, a peaceful animal, and whose flight is
not very far in the air, has nevertheless broken through their toils, other birds, soaring
more boldly towards the sky, will break through them with still greater force. Instead of a
feeble goose, the truth will send forth eagles and keen-eyed vultures.' This prediction was
fulfilled by the reformers.

"When the venerable priest had been summoned by Sigismund's order before the Council of Constance,
and had been thrown into prison, the chapel of Bethlehem, in which he had proclaimed the gospel
and the future triumphs of Christ, occupied his mind much more than his own defence. One night
the holy martyr saw in imagination, from the depths of his dungeon, the pictures of Christ
which he had painted on the walls of his oratory, effaced by the Pope and his bishops. This
vision distressed him; but on the next day he saw many painters occupied in restoring these
figures in greater number and in brighter colors. As soon as the task was ended, the painters,
who were surrounded by an immense crowd, exclaimed, 'Now let the popes and bishops come! they
shall never efface them more!' And many people rejoiced in Bethlehem, and I with them, adds
John Huss. 'Busy yourself with your defence rather than with your dreams,' said his faithful
friend, the Knight of Chlum, to whom he had communicated this vision. 'I am no dreamer,' replied
Huss, 'but I maintain this for certain, that the image of Christ will never be effaced. They
have wished to destroy it, but it shall be painted afresh in all hearts by much better preachers
than myself. The nation that loves Christ will rejoice at this. And I, awaking from the dead,
and rising so to speak, from my grave, shall leap with great joy.'" History of the Reformation,
Book I, Chap. 6.

This bold witness for Christ was burned at the stake July 6, 1415, by order of the General
Council of Constance. When the fagots were piled up around him ready for the torch, he said
to the executioner, "You are now going to burn a goose [Huss signifying goose in the Bohemian
language]; but in a century you will have a swan whom you can neither roast nor boil." Fox's
Book of Martyrs. This was fulfilled in Martin Luther.

Henry Institorus, an inquisitor, uttered these remarkable words: "'All the world cries out
and demands a council, but there is no human power that can reform the church by a council.
The Most High will find other means, which are at present unknown to us, although they may
be at our very doors, to bring back the church to its pristine condition.' This remarkable
prophecy, delivered by an inquisitor at the very period of Luther's birth, is the best apology
for the reformation."

Andrew Proles, provincial of the Augustines, used often to say: "Whence, then, proceeds so
much darkness and such horrible superstitions? O my brethren! Christianity needs a bold and
a great reform, and methinks I see it already approaching.... I am bent with the weight of
years, and weak in body, and I have not the learning, the ability, and eloquence, that so great
an undertaking requires. But God will raise up a hero, who by his age, strength, talents, learning,
genius and eloquence, shall hold the foremost place. He will begin the reformation; he will
oppose error, and God will give him boldness to resist the mighty ones of the earth."

John Hilten censured the most flagrant abuses of the monastic life, and the exasperated monks
threw him into prison and treated him shamefully. "The Franciscan, forgetting his malady and
groaning heavily, replied: 'I bear your insults calmly for the love of Christ; for I have said
nothing that can injure the monastic state: I have only censured its most crying abuses.' 'But,'
continued he (according to what Melancthon records in his Apology for the Augsburg Confession
of Faith), 'another man will rise in the year of our Lord 1516: he will destroy you, and you
shall not be able to resist him.'"

In 1516 Luther held a public discussion with Feld-kirchen, in which he upheld certain doctrines
of truth that made a great stir among the Romanists. Says D'Aubigne: "The disputation took
place in 1516. This was Luther's first attack upon the dominion of the sophists and upon the
Papacy, as he himself characterizes it." And again, "This disputation made a great noise, and
it has been considered as the beginning of the reformation." Book I, Chap. 9. The next year,
however, he entered publicly upon the actual work of reformation.

Frederick of Saxony, surnamed the Wise, was the most powerful elector of the German empire
at the period of the reformation. A dream he had and related just before the world was startled
by the first great act of reformation is so striking that I feel justified in repeating it
in this connection. It was as follows:

"Having gone to bed last night, tired and dispirited, I soon fell asleep after saying my prayers,
and slept calmly for about two hours and a half. I then awoke, and all kinds of thoughts occupied
me until midnight.... I then fell asleep again, and dreamed the Almighty sent me a monk, who
was a true son of Paul the apostle. He was accompanied by all the saints, in obedience to God's
command, to bear him testimony, and to assure me that he did not come with any fraudulent design,
but that all he should do was conformable to the will of God. They asked my gracious permission
to let him write something on the doors of the palace-chapel at Wittemberg, which I conceded
through my chancellor. Upon this, the monk retired thither and began to write; so large were
the characters that I could read from Schweinitz what he was writing [about 18 miles]. The
pen he used was so long that its extremity reached as far as Rome, where it pierced the ears
of a lion which lay there, and shook the triple crown on the Pope's head. All the cardinals
and princes ran up hastily and endeavored to support it.... I stretched out my arm: that moment
I awoke with my arm extended, in great alarm and very angry with this monk, who could not guide
his pen better. I recovered myself a little.... It was only a dream. I was still half asleep,
and once more closed my eyes. The dream came again. The lion, still disturbed by the pen, began
to roar with all his might, until the whole city of Rome, and all the States of the holy empire,
ran up to know what was the matter. The Pope called upon us to oppose this monk, and addressed
himself particularly to me, because the friar was living in my dominions. I again awoke, repeated
the Lord's prayer, entreated God to preserve his Holiness, and fell asleep.... I then dreamt
that all the princes of the empire, and we along with them, hastened to Rome, and endeavored
one after another to break this pen; but the greater our exertions the stronger it became:
it crackled as if it had been made of iron: we gave it up as hopeless. I then asked the monk
(for I was now at Rome, now at Wittemberg) where he had got that pen, and how it came to be
so strong. [In those days they used goosequills for pens.] 'This pen,' replied he, 'belonged
to a Bohemian goose [Huss] a hundred years old. I had it from one of my old schoolmasters.
It is so strong because no one can take the pith out of it, and I am myself quite astonished
at it.' On a sudden I heard a loud cry; from the monk's long pen had issued a host of other
pens. I awoke a third time; it was day light." History of the Reformation, Book III, Chap. 4.

Frederick related the foregoing to his brother John, the Duke of York, on the morning of Oct.
31, 1517, stating that he had dreamed it during the previous night. The same day at noon Martin
Luther advanced boldly to the chapel at Wittemberg and posted upon the door ninety-five theses,
or propositions, against the Papal doctrine of indulgences. This was his public entrance upon
the great work of reformation. The importance of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century is
incalculable. It gave the deathblow to the universal spiritual supremacy of Rome. As we have
already seen, the Papacy had for centuries held despotic sway over the minds and the consciences
of men. One potent cause of the Reformation was the great Revival of Learning that marked the
close of the medieval and the beginning of the modern period of history. This great mental
awakening contrasted sharply with the blind ignorance and superstition of the Middle Ages,
and caused many men to doubt the Scriptural authority of many of the doctrines and ceremonies
of the Church of Rome; such as invocation of saints, auricular confession, use of images, worship
of the Virgin Mary, etc.

Scandals and abuses in the Church of Rome also hastened the Reformation. During the fifteenth
century the morals of that church had sunk to the greatest depths of iniquity. The Popes themselves
were, in some cases, monsters of impurity and iniquity, insomuch that historians are obliged
to draw the vail over many of their dark deeds.

But the real occasion of the revolt of the northern nations of Europe against the jurisdiction
of Rome was the controversy regarding indulgences. "These in the Catholic church, are remissions,
to penitents of punishment due for sin, upon the performances of some work of mercy or piety,
or the payment of a sum of money." When Leo X. was elected to the Papal dignity (1513), he
found the church in great need of money for the building of Saint Peter's and other undertakings,
and he had recourse to a grant of indulgences to fill the coffers of the church. The power
of dispensing these indulgences in Saxony in Germany was given to a Dominican friar named Tetzel.
This fanatic enthusiast entertained the most exaggerated opinion of the efficacy of indulgences.
In his harrangues he uttered such expressions as the following:

"Indulgences are the most precious and the most noble of God's gifts." "There is no sin so
great that an indulgence can not remit; ... only let him pay well, and all will be forgiven
him." "Come, and I will give you letters, all properly sealed, by which even the sins that
you intend to commit may be pardoned." "I would not change my privileges for those of St. Peter
in heaven; for I have saved more souls by my indulgences than the apostle by his sermons."
"The Lord Omnipotent hath ceased to reign; he has resigned all power to the Pope." See D'Aubigne's
History of the Reformation, Book III, Chap. 1.

Martin Luther was an Augustine monk and a teacher of theology in the University of Wittemberg.
Before Tetzel appeared in Germany, Luther possessed a wide reputation for learning and piety,
and he had also entertained doubts respecting many of the doctrines of the church. During an
official visit to Rome in 1510 he was almost overwhelmed with sorrow because of the moral corruption
there; but while penitentially ascending on his knees the sacred stairs of the Lateran, he
seemed to hear a voice thundering in his soul, "The just shall live by faith!" This marked
an important epoch in his career.

When Tetzel appeared in Saxony with his indulgences, Luther fearlessly opposed him. He drew
up ninety-five theses against the infamous traffic and nailed them to the door of the church
at Wittemberg, and invited all scholars to criticise them and point out if they were opposed
to the doctrine of the Word of God or of the early church Fathers. Here the invention of printing
proved to be a powerful agency in advancing the cause of reformation by scattering copies of
these theses everywhere; and soon the continent of Europe was in a perfect turmoil of controversy.
The Pope excommunicated Luther as a heretic. In reply Luther burned the Papal bull publicly
at Wittemberg. Shortly afterward Luther produced his celebrated translation of the Bible in
the German language. Even a brief history of the entire Reformation would be too large for
the limits of the present volume, therefore with a few words respecting the nature of the work
of the Reformation we will pass on to another prophetic vision.

The great secret of the early success of the reformers was their appeal from the decisions
of councils and regulations of men to the Word of God. So long as the Word and Spirit of God
were allowed their proper place as the Governors of God's people, the work was a spiritual
blessing. But this happy state of affairs did not long continue. Within a few years the followers
of the reformers were divided into hostile sects and began to oppose and persecute each other.
Luther denounced Zwingle as a heretic, and "the Calvinists would have no dealings with the
Lutherans." The first Protestant creed was the Augsburg Confession (1530). This date marks
an important epoch. From this time the people began to lose sight of the Word and Spirit of
God as their Governors and to turn to the disciplines of their sects, which they upheld by
every means possible. Thus we find Calvin at Geneva consenting to the burning of Servetus,
because of a difference of religious views; and in England the Anglican Protestants waged the
most bitter, cruel, and relentless war not only against Catholics, but against all Protestants
who refused to conform to the Established Church. The Protestants placed armies in the field
and fought for their creeds, as during the Thirty Years' War in Germany and the long period
of the Hugenot wars in France. The real work of the Reformation, the promulgation of so much
of the truth of the Bible, was an inestimable blessing to the world; but the rise of Protestantism
(organized sectism) in 1530 introduced another period of apostasy as distinct in many of its
features as was that of Romanism before it. The historian D'Aubigne recognizes an important
change at this period. Preface to Vol. V.

    11. And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and
    he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

    12. And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before
    him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to
    worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

    13. And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
    from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

    14.

    15. And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,
    that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as
    many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
    killed.

    16. And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor,
    free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in
    their foreheads:

    17. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the
    mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

    18. Here is wisdom.

The symbolic description of this beast directs us also to a political and a religious system
rising at the expiration of the twelve hundred and sixty years' reign of the first beast, but
that he was no such terrible beast politically as the one before him is proved by the fact
that he had but two horns and they like a lamb. This beast rose "out of the earth"--the Apocalyptic
earth, or the territory of the Roman empire. The first beast rose out of the sea, which, as
before shown, signifies the heart of the empire in an agitated state; for the ten horns came
up through the greatest political convulsions that the page of history records. When John beheld
the second beast "coming up," however, the empire was in a state of comparative quiet, although
fierce wars followed afterward. He stands as a symbol of Protestantism in Europe; although
his power and influence afterwards extended beyond the "earth"--the Apocalyptic earth--into
"the whole world." Chap. 16:14. That this beast came up upon the same territory occupied by
the Papacy is proved also by the statement that "he exerciseth all the power of the first beast
before him." It was predicted in a subsequent chapter (17:16) that the ten horns, or kingdoms
of Europe, after supporting the Papacy during the Dark Ages, would later turn against her.
This has met a remarkable fulfilment under the reign of Protestantism.

The first two nations to turn violently against Popery were England and Germany. They have
ever since been the chief supporters and defenders of Protestantism, and they are doubtless
the two kingdoms symbolized by the two horns of the beast. While at one time the Pope was a
temporal sovereign and could, by his political and ecclesiastical power, humble with ease the
mightiest nations of Europe before him, his authority has been wrested from him by degrees,
so that to-day not a vestige of his temporal power remains, and his anathemas fall harmlessly.
The nations have asserted their rights as kings. When King Victor Emmanuel entered Rome on
the twentieth day of September, 1870, the Pope's temporal sun set forever, and he does not
control even the city in which he lives--Rome. He is often referred to as "the prisoner of
the Vatican." "He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity," said the prophecy;
"he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword." It was by force of arms that
the Popes obtained and maintained their temporal power over the nations, and by the force of
arms they have had their authority torn from them. Religion has been referred to as "the basis
of government"; for the legislators of any country are to a great degree influenced in their
deliberations by religious sentiments. In all Protestant countries that greatest of Protestant
principles, religious liberty, is as truly recognized by statute as was that infernal principle
of the Papacy, religious intolerance, when formerly enforced by law. Protestant principles
have so far permeated the nations of Europe formerly controlled by the Papacy that religious
toleration is generally granted. In Italy, the headquarters of Popedom, where the Catholics
are greatly in the majority, religious liberty is granted by law. And even Spain, denominated
by the Encyclopædia Britannica "the most Catholic country in the world," exhibits "a general
indifferentism to religion," meaning that the fanaticism and intolerance of former ages that
caused thousands, and perhaps millions, to be slain, is rapidly dying out. In the vision before
us, however, the special actions ascribed to this beast--speaking, working miracles, deceiving,
making an image and imparting life to it, etc., which all belong properly to the department
of human life--show conclusively that it is the character of this beast as an ecclesiastical
power that is the chief point under consideration. He was not to become such a terrible beast
politically (for his horns were only like a lamb), but "he spake as a dragon." As soon as we
enter the department to which speaking by analogy refers us, we find this beast to be a great
religious power; and it is in this character alone that he is dilineated in the remainder of
the chapter. That the description of a religious system is the main burden of this symbol,
is shown also by the fact that it is in every case referred to in subsequent chapters as the
"false prophet." Chap. 16:13; 19:20; 20:10. Therefore every reference I make to this second
beast hereafter should be understood as signifying the religious system of Protestantism, unless
otherwise stated.

That Protestantism in its many forms can be properly represented by a single symbol--a beast
or false prophet--may seem a little strange at first; but when we come to consider next the
making of an image to the beast, it will be seen that the Protestant sects, from God's standpoint
of viewing, are all alike in character, as were the multitudinous forms of heathen worship
represented under the single symbol of the dragon. Hence only one beast, or the making of one
image, was necessary to stand as representative of the entire number. It will be noticed by
the reader that from verse 12 to the close of the chapter the term beast signifies the first
beast, or the Papacy, and that the second beast, or Protestantism, is designated by the pronoun he.

Image is defined to be "an imitation, representation, similitude of any person or thing; a
copy, a likeness, an effigy." The second beast, then, is to manufacture something in imitation
of the first beast. If any doubt exists as to which phase of the first beast, political or
ecclesiastical, is copied, it can be settled by considering what is said of the image made
from the original. "The image of the beast should--speak." This directs us by analogy, as heretofore
explained, to the department of religious affairs; hence the second beast forms an ecclesiastical
organization in imitation of the hierarchy of Rome. At this juncture the Protestant will doubtless
exclaim, "Oh, our churches are nothing like the church of Rome!" But consider a little in the
light of truth. God's Word teaches that they bear the close relationship of mother and her
daughters (Rev. 17:5), and by the help of the Lord we shall point out a similarity of character
in this and subsequent chapters. The symbol of the church of Rome in chapter 17 is that of
a corrupt prostitute, while the symbol of Protestantism is that of her harlot daughters. The
Roman church is a humanly organized institution governed by a set of fallible men, their claims
of infallibility to the contrary notwithstanding. Protestant sects, likewise, are all human
organizations (even though they may sometimes deny it), and are governed by a man or a conference
of men. The Roman Catholic church makes and prescribes the theology that her members believe.
Protestant churches, also, make their own disciplines and prescribe rules of faith and practise.
The Word of God, inspired by his Spirit, could not be enforced in Romanism without destroying
it; for its main spirit is Antichrist. So, too, the whole Word in Protestantism would soon
annihilate her God-dishonoring sects; for they are all contrary to its plain teachings, which
condemn divisions and enjoin perfect unity and oneness upon the redeemed of the Lord. What
is said concerning the image of the beast applies to sectarianism as a whole and the human
organization of all her so-called churches, regardless of the differences that exist between
them as individual institutions; for they may differ as widely as the various systems of heathen
religions symbolized by the dragon, yet they can be represented by the single symbol of an
image to the first beast, because they are built upon the same general principles--are but
human organizations, falsely called churches of Christ, and are all contrary to the Scriptures.

Imparting life to the image of the beast simply signifies the complete organization of the
ecclesiastical institutions so that they are capable of self-government and their decrees possess
authority. Every living body is animated by a spirit. The sectarian spirit that animates the
Methodist body will lead people into that body, etc.; but the one Spirit of God will, if permitted,
baptize us all into the one body of Christ, where we can all "drink into one Spirit." 1 Cor.
12:13. "And he spake as a dragon" signifies the great authority by which his laws are enacted
and enforced upon the people. Fire from heaven upon Elijah's sacrifice was the attestation
of God to his divine mission. Bringing down fire from heaven, then, symbolically describes
the claims of this beast to being a true prophet of the Lord.

At this point we must make a distinction which, being true in the facts of history, must necessarily
be intended in the symbolic representation. According to the symbols of the preceding chapter
the woman, or true church, "fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God,
that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days." The time-prophecy
is the same and covers the same period as the reign of the Papal beast; therefore just as an
important change in the Papacy occured at the expiration of the prophetic period, so also we
must expect a radical change with respect to the true church: it must no longer be completely
obscured in the wilderness.

As the Reformation, and Protestantism as a religion, was the means of ending Rome's universal
spiritual supremacy, so also the same movement must be regarded as possessing sufficient light
and truth to again bring into prominence the work of the Spirit and the true people of God.
"Fire from heaven" may therefore be regarded as describing the divine work of reformation,
the unfolding of truth accompanied by the saving power of God. Such spiritual work has accompanied
the origin of various religious movements during the Protestant era.

The general description of the two-horned beast, however, brings into prominence an evil characteristic--the
disposition to lead people into deception by making an image to the beast and then worshiping
it. The evil does not inhere in the work of bringing down "fire from heaven," but in image-making
and image-worship, for which the Spiritual work simply furnished an occasion. The Spiritual
work of reformation is therefore to be distinguished from the later work of creed- and sect-making.
And since the beast takes advantage of Spirit manifestations, in order to deceive men, he becomes
a sort of apostate and is denominated "the false prophet." See Chap. 16:14; 19:20.

Ecclesiastically considered, the two-horned beast stands as the symbol of the religious system
of Protestantism as a whole--a peculiar combination of truth and error, of good and bad, of
"fire from heaven" and false, miracle-working power (chap. 16:14); while the "image to the
beast" signifies the sectarian institution--the man-made, man-controlled, unscriptural sect
machinery manufactured in imitation of the Papal original. To exalt such earth-born churches
and lead people to adore and worship them is but a species of idolatry and the rankest deception.
It is a sad fact that multitudes of people in Protestantism are more devoted to their particular
church than they are to the Lord Jesus Christ. They can witness the open rejection of God's
precious Word and the vilest profanation of his holy name, without uttering a word of protest;
but let anyone say a word against their church, and instantly they are aroused to the highest
pitch of excitement--beast-worshipers!

The Protestant era has witnessed many wonderful reformations in which the true fire of God
fell upon waiting souls, but this initial work of the Spirit has in each case been employed
as an excuse for taking the next step--making an image. Thousands of honest souls, lacking
better light, have been induced to submit to such human organization. But the truly saved have
always loved and adored their Lord more than the human church to which they were attached,
therefore they should not be regarded as beast-worshipers. They are the ones whom the Lord
denominates his people when the voice is heard calling them out of Babylon. Chap. 18:4.

The "mark of the beast" next claims our attention. The beast referred to is the Papacy. How
did the Papacy mark its subjects? Undoubtedly, by the false spirit which animated that organization,
branding them all with its delusive doctrines and errors. In a previous chapter the servants
of God were represented as receiving the seal of God in their foreheads. This was shown to
signify the pure Word and doctrines of the Bible being planted within them by the Holy Spirit.
In making the sect image in imitation of the Papal original, then, the principle of marking
subjects has also been copied. The members of every sect organization are indelibly marked.
You can not become one of them without solemnly agreeing to believe the doctrines taught in
their discipline and accepting the government of their man-made institutions. Subscribing to
the rules of faith and practise that originated with the sect shows how its members worship
the image. They are also said to worship the first beast, the original of the image. How is
this fulfilled? In the same manner that the worshipers of the first beast worshiped the dragon
that preceded it; namely, by accepting and believing false principles of faith that originated
in the system immediately preceding. Protestant sects have transferred many of the false doctrines
of Romanism to their own creeds, hence they worship the first beast just as truly as the Papists
worshiped the dragon by accepting heathenish principles. The greatest principle of false doctrine
that originated with Catholicism, and one that has been transferred to every Protestant sect,
is, that a human organization is necessary to complete the church of Christ on earth. The church
of Rome has an earthly head and a human government; and Protestants, also, firmly believe the
unscriptural doctrine that they must bow to an organization of men and thus be under a visible
headship: they receive the mark of the beast. Many sects have also copied other Popish doctrines,
such as infant baptism, the destruction of all outside of the pales of the church (?), infantile
damnation, sprinkling, and other things too numerous to mention. Thus, they worship the first
beast as well as his image.

They also receive the "name of the beast." Here again "beast" refers to the Papacy. The Papal
beast was represented as being full of the names of blasphemy, which blasphemy was shown to
signify the usurpation of prerogatives and rights belonging to God alone. The greatest ecclesiastical
usurpation reached by the Romish hierarchy was that of claiming to be the head of the church
and the right to prescribe and enforce their doctrines, naming their organization the Holy
Catholic Church. In making their sect organizations in imitation, Protestants, as above stated,
have transferred the same principle and make the same blasphemous claim of a right to make
disciplines to govern God's people, and then name their sect machinery a church of God. The
name may be Methodist, Baptist, Mennonite, Episcopalian, or what not, it is only a beast name,
yet a name that you must accept if you desire to become one of them.

They not only receive the name of the beast, but also receive the "number of his name." It
will be necessary first to explain what is meant by the number of a name. "The modern system
of notation by the nine digits and the cipher, was not introduced until the tenth century,
but on account of its superior excellence, has since superseded every other. Previous to this
great discovery, the letters of the alphabet were used to denote numbers, each letter having
the power of a number as well as a sound. The same system is still retained among us for certain
purposes. The Roman letters I. V. X. L. C. D. M., have each the power of expressing a number.
This, however, was the common and the best mode of notation that the ancients possessed." The
number of a name, therefore, was merely the number denoted by the several letters of that name.

The number of the name of the beast--the first beast--is said to be the number of a man. When
we enter the Romish hierarchy and search for a man the number of whose name will be six hundred
and sixty-six, where could we go more appropriately than to the Pope himself, its authorized
head? The Scriptures point him out particularly as the "man of sin," "the son of perdition."
2 Thes. 2:3, 4. Has the Pope of Rome a name the letters of which, used as numerals, make six
hundred and sixty-six? Yes. He wears in jeweled letters upon his miter the following blasphemous
inscription: Vicarius Filii Dei--Vicar of the Son of God. Taking out of this name all the letters
that the Latins used as numerals, we have just six hundred and sixty-six. U and V were both
formerly used to denote five.

    V ..... 5     F ..... 0
    I ..... 1     I ..... 1
    C ... 100     L .... 50
    A ..... 0     I ..... 1
    R ..... 0     I ..... 1
    I ..... 1     D ... 500
    U ..... 5     E ..... 0
    S ..... 0     I ..... 1
                        ---
                        666

In some manner the worshipers of Protestant images also receive the number of this name--six
hundred and sixty-six. The name is that of "Vicar of the Son of God." In all Protestantism
(see remarks on chapter 11:7, 8) the true Vicars of Christ on earth--the Word and Spirit of
God--have been set aside, and conferences of men have taken their places in all the official
acts relative to spiritual affairs. Hence the number of the name applies to them as well. What
that number specially symbolizes I do not know, unless it is, as has been explained by others--division.
While the policy of Romanism has been that of unity, still the false claims made by one individual
can be as well made by another, and by many, which has been the case, as just explained; therefore
it would not be improper at all to make the Pope's number a symbol of the whole, since his
system has been so largely copied by the rest. Our heads have both diverted themselves by number

 For example see pp. 252, 291-294 of the present work. It is possible that
the persecuting principle ascribed to the two-horned beast may include both the literal and
the ecclesiastical cutting-off, reference being made directly to the intolerant spirit.]

The facts just stated are well illustrated by the following circumstances. A few years ago
a brother in the ministry went into a certain town to find a place to conduct a series of holiness
meetings. He was directed by a Presbyterian lady to their pastor, who, she said, was a believer
in the doctrine of holiness. When he called on the minister and made known his errand, the
first question asked him was this, "Are you a member of the Presbyterian church?" The brother
answered in the negative. He did not have the name of the beast. The next question that greeted
him was this, "Do you believe the Westminster Confession of Faith to be orthodox?" He answered,
"No, sir." He did not have the mark of the beast. The last question asked was, "Do you belong
to any of the various orthodox Protestant denominations?" The brother said, "No." He did not
have the number of his name. The answer was, "You can not have our house."

While on a missionary trip in the Near East, the writer, in company with another brother, attended
a Seventh-Day Adventist service in Bucharest, Roumania. After the sermon another brother requested
that we be given the opportunity to speak a little, but the request was absolutely refused.
It was explained that we would say nothing against them or their work but only speak about
salvation; but we were not permitted even to testify in a few words. The difficulty was that
we did not have either the "mark of the beast" or its "name."

CHAPTER XIV. These were redeemed from among men, being the
    firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

    5. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
    fault before the throne of God.

There is no difficulty in identifying this company on Mount Sion as the true people of God
in marked contrast with the worshipers of all corrupt and false religion. As to the chronology
of the event, it is evident that we have here a continuation of the same series of prophecy
beginning with the apostolic period in chapter XII, describing alternately the true church
and the false church.

At the beginning of this series the true church, symbolized by the star-crowned woman, fled
into the wilderness and was there lost to view; while the leopard beast and the two-horned
beast of chapter XIII, symbolizing the two leading forms of organized Christianity, were brought
into prominent view. It is therefore fitting that the true church should again appear and be
given her proper position and work in the world before the end of all earthly things.

That the company here brought to view represents the true church is shown by its agreement
with the church of God before the apostasy began. In the seventh chapter we have seen that
before the political calamities befell the Western Roman Empire the work of sealing God's servants
was accomplished, twelve thousand from each of the twelve tribes of Israel being sealed, thus
representing symbolically the fact that God's church, comprising the true Israel, was perfect
and complete, no part being omitted. In the chapter under consideration we have this divine
sealing process again after the apostasy, and once more the definite number 144,000 occurs,
showing that the church before the end is to be perfect and complete.

The contrast of this company with the ecclesiastical powers in the preceding chapter proclaims
in an unmistakeable manner the fact that we have here described a true reformation and work
of God before the end of time. In the morning-time of the dispensation the redeemed of earth
were represented as singing praises to Christ; so also the company here brought to view unite
in singing a song which only the redeemed can know. This company is on Mount Sion, not in the
darkness of the wilderness, they are with the Lamb, not wandering after the beast; they are
not even following the beast that was "like a lamb," but they are with the true Lamb, the Savior
of the world; they have the "Father's name written in their foreheads," not the mark or the
name of the beast. It is said of them that "these are they which were not defiled with women,
for they are virgins." Fornication and adultery, as will be explained later, is a symbol of
spiritual idolatry; and the chastity of this redeemed company shows that they were free from
the abominations of the apostasy. They "follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." Their names
are in the book of life, and they do not worship the beast. Chap. 13:8.

Here, then, we have a symbol of the church of God in the latter days standing distinct from
the great apostasy.

    6. And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having
    the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
    earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,

    7.

    8. And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
    is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
    of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

    9.

Another phase of the last reformation is here brought to view--its communicative genius. It
not only stands clear from the apostasy, but it sounds the warnings of God and proclaims his
message. The first messenger had a very important message to deliver, even "the everlasting
gospel." His message was not limited to the inhabitants of "the earth"--the Apocalyptic earth--only,
but included "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people," showing that it was of universal
importance. It was not a new gospel, but the everlasting gospel, the same gospel preached before
the long period of apostasy. There is one phase different, however, and that is that the nearness
of the second coming of Christ is a leading feature; the messenger with loud voice warns the
people to prepare for the awful judgment just at hand by turning to "worship him that made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." The apostle Paul cautioned the
Thessalonian brethren not to entertain the idea that the advent of Christ was then near at
hand, for it could not come until after the great period of apostasy that he predicted; but
here is a messenger now claiming that the "hour of his judgment is come"--an event just at
hand. He carries his special message to all people; for Jesus declared, "This gospel of the
kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the
end come." Matt. 24:14. This represents the restoration of gospel truth in the reformation
that was begun about the year A.D. 1880 and that is now being carried to all nations by a holy
ministry.

The nature of this restoration work is clearly shown. Its leading feature is its missionary
character, the proclamation of the pure gospel to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people." Since the days of the apostles the whole gospel has not been boldly declared and carried
forward with burning missionary zeal. Romanism and Protestantism have conducted their missionary
work and, according to chap. 16:14, their sphere of influence will extend throughout "the whole
world"; but here is clearly set forth the fact that God has authorized another universal message
and world-wide work wholly distinguished from all others. The contrast between the worshipers
of the beast and his image and those composing the redeemed company on Mount Sion is so clear,
also the nature of the work done by each, that we can not possibly identify them as being one.

This work of conducting a world-wide missionary enterprise may appear to be a gigantic task,
but the seeming impossibility vanishes when we consider the fact (to be more fully developed
hereafter) that God calls into this service all his people who are yet under the sectarian
yoke. With this great host already dispersed over the world, the work of making known this
last message can and will be accomplished.

The positive statement that the hour of his judgment is come shows that the end is exceedingly
near; hence the second and third angels must follow the first in the closest proximity possible
in order to introduce their messages before the wrath of God is poured out upon apostate Christendom.
The time is so short that these three messengers can not possibly refer to three distinct reformations
in the world; hence they must signify three important phases in the one last reformation that
carries the gospel to all nations in the short period of an "hour," which time also includes
the final judgment.

A careful study of these three messages will show that they are inseparably connected. The
second cry was against Babylon, that she had fallen. Rev. 18:1, 2 proves this fall of Babylon
to be a moral one--a giving away to ungodliness, iniquity and all manner of deception. According
to chapter 16:19 the great city of Babylon is composed of three parts, being a confederation
of the dragon[10] (heathenism), the beast (Catholicism), and the false prophet (Protestantism).
Chap. 16:13, 14. It is evidently to this latter division of Babylon that this second message
applies; for Paganism was always a false religion, and Catholicism was always a corrupt one,
during whose reign the church of God, as already shown, was separate. Protestantism, then,
was the only part of the great city that could fall morally or spiritually. During the space
of three hundred and fifty years, from the formation of the first Protestant creed, she held
reign and authority over the people of God, who were scattered among her hundreds of opposing
sects.

[Footnote 10: That the dragon should be a part of great Babylon seems at first improbable;
but in this statement reference is made, not to the dragon in his original, or Pagan, state,
but to the form in which he is manifesting himself in these last days to deceive the nations,
working in conjunction with apostate Christendom. This phase of the dragon power which brings
him into harmony with, and, in reality, a part of, modern Babylon, will be more clearly understood
when we come to consider the three unclean spirits that come out of the mouth of the dragon,
the beast, and the false prophet (chap. 16:13, 14), and the release of the dragon in chapter
20:7-9.]

In this condition the faithful children of God, although bearing the mark and name of the beast,
longed for restoration of the divine, primitive standard; but in the cloudy atmosphere of that
period they could not clearly discern the whole truth. Later, when the full tidings of the
everlasting gospel came, there came also a revelation that Babylon is fallen and that God is
calling his people out of confusion just before the end of time.

I call to witness every child of God who has been with the present reformation from its beginning,
if there were not three special phases of the development of the truth, as follows: 1. A wonderful
revival of spirituality among a few of God's chosen ones, caused by the "everlasting gospel"
being revealed to them as never before. 2. The knowledge of the truth and deep experience thus
obtained prepared the way for the next step, which was the discovery that the "churches" were
a part of the great Babylon of Revelation and were in a fallen condition, "a hold of every
foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Chap. 18:2, 3. Hence the cry went
up, "Babylon is fallen, is fallen." 3. Then followed immediately the message to God's people
to "flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver every man his soul," warning them that no
one could any longer bear the mark of the beast or worship his image without forfeiting eternal
salvation and that the fearful judgments of heaven would soon descend upon every one who refused
to obey the message and to walk in the light. The last two phases, which apply to Babylon,
are the same and in the same order as the description given in chapter 18:1-4. First, an angel
from heaven cries mightily with a strong voice, "Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen"; and
then "another voice" from heaven says, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE." Halleluiah! John, also,
saw this glorious result of the three messages--"And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled
with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over
his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
Chap. 15:2, 3. Let all the people of God rejoice!

  "Hail the day so long expected,
    Hail the year of full release;
  Zion's walls are now erected,
    And the watchmen publish peace.

  "Now on Shiloh's wide dominion,
    Hear the trumpets loudly roar:
  Babylon's fallen, is fallen, is fallen,
    Babylon's fallen to rise no more."

Those of the Lord's people who through lack of sufficient light were yoked up with unbelievers
in Protestantism, labored faithfully to upbuild the very sectarian institutions that God was
against and that were destined to be destroyed, though they themselves were saved as by fire;
but from the time this reformation began the redeemed die in the triumphs of a living faith,
and their labors in upbuilding the true cause and kingdom of God are still blessed and fruitful,
being perpetuated in the works that follow them. As before mentioned, God's people during the
reign of Romanism expected her universal supremacy to come to an end, and their patience was
greatly exercised in waiting for the appointed time to arrive. It came with a great spiritual
reformation. Then followed another period of apostasy, during which time God's people again
looked forward to something better in the future. Many remarkable predictions of this present
holiness reformation were uttered by some of the most spiritual saints during the Protestant
era, and I can not refrain from mentioning a few of them in this connection.

D'Aubigne: "The nineteenth century is called to resume the work which the sixteenth century
was unable to accomplish." History of the Reformation, Book XV, Chap. 1.

Fletcher: "Only He will come with more mercy, and will increase the light that shall be at
eventide, according to his promise in Zech. 14:7. I should rather think that the visions are
not yet plainly disclosed; and that the day and hour in which the Lord will begin to make bare
his arm openly are still concealed from us. Oh, when will the communion of saints be complete?
Lord, hasten the time; and let me have a place among them that love thee, and love one another
in sincerity." This is an extract from a letter written by John Fletcher to Mr. Wesley, dated
London, May 26, 1757, as given in Joseph Benson's life of Fletcher, pp. 39, 40.

D'Aubigne again: "In every age it has been seen how great is the strength of an idea to penetrate
the masses, to stir nations, and to hurry them, if required, by thousands to the battle-field
and to death. But if so great be the strength of a human idea, what power must not a heaven-descended
idea possess, when God opens to it the gates of the heart! The world has not often seen so
much power at work; it was seen, however, in the early days of Christianity, and in the time
of the Reformation; and it will be seen in future ages." Book VI, Chap. 12.

Lorenzo Dow, comment on Rev. 14:6-11; 18:1-5: "The angel, or extraordinary messenger, with
his assistants, proclaiming the fall of Babylon will be known in his time. Also the one warning
the people of God to come out of Babylon literally, spiritually, and practically, will be known
also, and such other threatening for the omission of compliance is not to be found in all the
Bible." Dow's Works, p. 533.

The following extracts are from an old book written about 1812 by Theophilus R. Gates and entitled
"Truth Advocated." Through the kindness of a sister living in Allegan County, Michigan, the
writer was enabled to secure the following from the only copy of this book known to be in existence--she
having borrowed it of her neighbor, a relative of its author.

On Rev. 14:11: "I would here gladly drop the subject, lest I give offense; but duty compels
me to remark, what can not be denied, that an inordinate attachment to certain systems and
forms of religion, has occasioned all the strifes, animosities, and persecutions, that have
so long agitated the Christian world; and if God be just, every one must drink of the cup of
his indignation, according to his offense. The beast and his image, as it exists in Protestant
countries, seems in this place particularly meant; and our own land is full of the number of
his name. That such a testimony will one day go forth we must believe, or else St. John saw
that which will never be: and the testimony will as certainly be received; for a company in
the next chapter are to be seen that had gotten the victory over the beast, his image, his
mark, and the number of his name. It is also equally true that as yet it has never gone forth;
and that at the time, great afflictions or suffering of some kind will be undergone to exercise
the patience of the saints.... It is at this very time, no doubt, that the three unclean spirits,
like frogs, come out of the mouth of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet; spirits
of devils working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world,
to gather them to the great battle of the great day of God Almighty. The greatest possible
efforts, indeed will now be made by all the sectarians to keep up their existence ... nor is
it any wonder that hireling ministers and system worshipers, Demetrius like, should be stirred
up and raise no small stir about the way; for it is evident, not only their craft is in danger
of being set at naught by this testimony, but also the great Diana of systems and forms of
religion to be despised, and their magnificence destroyed, whom now almost the whole Christian
world worshipeth." Pp. 281-283.

"And now commences an era of light and suffering, when the corrupt churches (with the kings
of the earth and great men united with them) being about to be wholly brought down, make one
general muster against Christ and his true worshipers. These things are clear to me as a ray
of light; and whoever lives at this time will see as great opposition and spite to the true
way of righteousness then set forth from sectarians and professors generally, as there was
from the Jews towards Christ and his testimony: and also, like the Jews, at the very time they
oppose the true way of the Lord with all their might, they will no doubt make the greatest
possible show of religion, will think they are the true church, yea will have a zeal for God,
carrying on religion with great success, forming societies, sending missionaries among the
heathen, etc., etc. That such an event will take place is very clear." Pp. 286-288.

"This happy period I never expect to see: but known unto the Lord only are all things. I know
that such a time will be; for we are assured by the angel, these are the true sayings of God:
and I also believe that it will take place within two centuries from this time. But oh! how
corrupt doth the world now appear to me.... Help me, O Lord, I pray thee, to do thy will.

"Whenever any body of people come into notice, establish their rules and institutions, and
become a respectable sect, they are the people of God then only in name; they cease to have
the nature any longer; and whoever unites himself to the same, constitutes himself one of the
beast's party, and so far as his influence extends, he helps to establish the kingdom of Antichrist
in the earth. This is clear from the prophecies of the Revelation, and it will answer no purpose
to take offense when the truth is spoken. These things will, moreover, sooner or later be declared
with great plainness by some one; and then will the man of sin put forth all his strength;
then will persecution come, and the beast muster his armies to defend himself and to destroy
the assailants, but in vain; for however few their number may be at first, and however furious
the battle may rage against them, they are destined to conquer. P. 313.

Speaking of sectarianism, he says further: "The same round of things will continue until the
evil is remedied.... When this shall take place, time only can determine with certainty. It
will probably commence slowly, and not come with any great outward observation. Few will at
first see or embrace the way, being strange to them, and appearing on account of their prejudices,
and the way they have been taught by the false prophet, to be wrong and improper: moreover,
being opposed to all others, they will have all others to oppose them. But though they are
despised and hated, and few in number, the Lord is with them." Pp. 322, 323.

On Rev. 16:13, 14: "I have already delivered my views with respect to these unclean spirits
... and it is not necessary to say much here upon the subject; only I would just observe, that
this will be a time of greater trial to Christians in general, and in a time in which more
will be deprived of every particle of true religion through the influence of false ministers
belonging to the different societies in Christendom, than any that has ever yet been in the
world. But while they are making these great exertions, they are only preparing themselves
and their deluded votaries for a more awful and complete destruction. For God Almighty is against
them, and they against Him; though they will know it not, but think perhaps all the while they
are his peculiar favorites, and that they are employed in maintaining his cause, like the Jews
before them, when it is only their own cause and men's traditions." P. 338.

"I am but as the voice of one crying in the wilderness of error and of sin, of wickedness and
delusion, testifying according to the best light given me; and any light that I can possibly
communicate will in a little time become as the feeble shining of the sun, by reason of the
greatness of the light that shall be hereafter." P. 354.

"A true and living testimony will go forth before this last period of the awful judgments of
God comes to a close, and in consequence of rejecting it, like the Jews of old, the wrath of
God will come upon them to the uttermost. The testimony against the worshipers of the beast,
by the third angel, Rev. 14:9, is the testimony that effectually overthrows the kingdom of
darkness and establishes the truth as it is in Jesus, pure and undefiled.... The authors of
this testimony will ... unlike to all who go before them, attack the evil at its root, and
expose the deceit, hypocrisy and wickedness of the different sects in a way that has never
before been done; for which they will suffer the greatest persecution. You may look upon these
things as the reveries of my own fancy; but some day or other, people will witness to the truth
of what I now write." Pp. 421, 422.

"All the reformations which go before this last great reform will only be partial and temporary.
They will only lop off the branches, or at the most, only strike at the body of the corrupt
tree, while the roots remain untouched and uninjured. But when this last testimony goes forth,
the very roots of the corrupt tree will be attacked." P. 426.

"Every sect is under an idea that whenever the Lord comes to establish truth in the earth,
it will be to establish their creed, raise up their sect, and bring the whole world into their
way. And when the faithful witnesses whom God will raise up shall openly declare that they
have all gone out of the way, that the greatest professors have so much of guile, selfishness
and party spirit about them as to be nothing but hypocrites, and that a person must be better
than they are or be lost forever; that sects are an abomination to the Lord; denounce eternal
death upon every advocate and adherent of men-made establishments; ... I say when such a testimony
as this goes forth, as it sooner or later will, no wonder that the sects, all with one accord,
should set themselves against it--should call it heresy--declare it will ruin the churches
if it is not suppressed.... Although, as I have before testified, I am only as the voice of
one crying in the wilderness--a mere babe in the knowledge of these things which are to be
revealed hereafter, yet I expect to raise a host of bigots and hypocrites against me.... Nor
can it be very long before the true light, in a very especial manner, will shine.... If these
things do not come to pass, then let me be called an enthusiast or a deceiver." Pp. 444-446.

The special characters of this vision and their work have been very difficult for me to identify
positively. Until clearer light on the matter is received, I choose to withhold an explanation
rather than to indulge in speculation. Its usual explanation is to apply the gathering of the
harvest of the earth to the work of the reformation now taking place and the vintage scene
to the final destruction of the wicked, their punishment being symbolized by the treading of
the "winepress of the wrath of God." This may be its signification. It is certain, however,
that in a subsequent chapter, the final judgment of the wicked is symbolized by the treading
of "the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God." Beyond this I can not now
speak with certainty.

CHAPTER XV.

    And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven
    angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up
    the wrath of God.

    2.

    3.

    4.

    7. And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
    golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and
    ever.

    8.

The scene presented to us in this vision is but an introduction to the solemn scenes of awful
judgment immediately following. The first thing that attracted John's attention was a sign,
great and marvelous, "seven angels having the seven last plagues." The reason why these are
denominated the "last plagues" is because that "in them is filled up the wrath of God." These
are the completion, then, the finishing up of the work of divine judgment against the persecutors
of the church. When the last one is poured out the work is done, the time of judgment is over.
These angels are not designed to symbolize any agencies on earth, for they do not appear on
earth; they are simply the conductors of the Revelation. God never commissions his people on
earth to perform such great judgments upon their persecutors as the temporal judgments of the
seven last plagues will be shown to be; but, on the contrary, he has given them the express
command not to avenge themselves, but to suffer wrong.

As soon as the subject of the plagues is introduced and before they are poured out, the narrative
suddenly changes and a short history of God's redeemed saints is given. The song of Moses was
that sung by the Israelites when they had escaped to the further side of the Red Sea, thus
securing perfect deliverance from their enemies. So, also, this company of worshipers sing
a great song of deliverance--deliverance from the beast and his image. In chapters 4 and 5
John saw the great host redeemed before the apostasy standing on this sea of glass, singing
the song of redemption--the song of the Lamb--but this company are enabled to sing another
song as well--the song of deliverance--for they have "gotten the victory over the beast, and
over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name." Halleluiah!

As before stated (chap. By "the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony," out of which the
seven angels came fully prepared for their work, is meant the most holy place of the sanctuary,
called "the tabernacle of the testimony" because there was deposited in it, beneath the wings
of the cherubim, the ark of the testimony, or God's covenant. It was therefore as from the
most holy place of the sanctuary--from the very presence of the Deity--that these angels went
forth commissioned to execute the seven last plagues. This shows that they went by the divine
command as ministers of vengeance. The purity and beauty of their attire denoted both the spotless
excellency of their characters and the justice of the work in which they were to engage. Although
theirs was a work of awful avenging judgment, still the garments they wore would not be soiled
thereby; and their flowing robes of white were girded up with a beautiful golden girdle. Therefore
there is no inconsistency between the purity and love of God and the work of his vengeance.
It would seem to human reasoning that the two are irreconcilable, but these symbols teach differently.

These angels received their vials (goblets) of wrath at the hands of one of the four living
creatures, who are symbols of the redeemed sons of earth. Their deliverance by one of these
doubtless denotes that these judgments were to be executed in their behalf and in answer to
their prayers. Chap. 6:10. Now their prayer is answered, and by their hand, as it were, the
vials of wrath are delivered with the divine sanction unto the seven angels to be poured out
upon these proud oppressors of the Lord's people. These vials, too, were "full of wrath." What
a fearful expression! Full of wrath, even "the wrath of God, who liveth forever and ever."
There was nothing in them but wrath and that to the very brim.

As soon as the vials were delivered, "the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God."
This symbol is taken from the Shekinah which filled the ancient tabernacle. We read that when
the tabernacle was finished, "a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of
the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,
because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle." Ex. 40:34,
35. The same thing occurred at the dedication of Solomon's temple. "The cloud filled the house
of the Lord, so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for the
glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord." 1 Kings 8:10, 11. So, also, in the symbol
before us the glory of God filled the temple so that no man was able to enter. This is intended
to set forth the fact that these avenging judgments were for the manifestation of the divine
glory and that there was no access to the throne of God nor to his mercy-seat to alter them
or to stay their execution. Such is the sublime scene presented to our view preparatory to
the pouring out of the seven last great plagues.

CHAPTER XVI.

    And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
    angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God
    upon the earth.

    2. And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;
    and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which
    had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his
    image.

A great voice out of the temple, now filled with the glory of the divine presence, commanded
the seven angels to enter upon their mission. It came, therefore, from God, who alone fixed
the time for these judgments to begin.

Before an intelligent explanation of these plagues can be given, however, the following points
must be made clear: 1. Where the vials were poured out. 2. Upon whom they were emptied. 3.
Why they were thus poured out. 4. When they were fulfilled, or, rather, at what time they began
to be fulfilled. These points we will first briefly consider in the order named, after which
we will discuss the nature of the plagues and their individual application.

1. The place where these vials of wrath were poured out was "upon the earth"; that is, the
Apocalyptic earth, or that portion of the earth made the special subject of Apocalyptic vision;
namely, the territory of the ten kingdoms. The last two vials, however, will be found to embrace
a larger territory.

2. They were poured out upon those "which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshiped
his image." It has already been shown that the image made by the second beast of chapter 13
was the Protestant ecclesiastical organizations; hence the "beast" here referred to, to which
the image was made, must signify the ecclesiastical hierarchy of Rome, the original. So the
plagues fell upon the adherents of both organized Romanism and Protestantism in Europe.

3. The reason why the judgments of the first three vials especially descended upon them was
because "they had shed the blood of saints and prophets." Verse 6. That Romanism was a fierce
oppressor of God's people has already been noticed: Protestantism as their persecutor, also,
must now be considered further. Protestant sects after they first became established and got
power in their own hands, acted much in the same manner as the church of Rome did before them,
persecuting, banishing, imprisoning, and even putting to death those who refused to receive
their tenets or to conform to the system of religion they had adopted. The Lutherans, at first
a pious, persecuted people, on becoming numerous and exalted by the favor of the great, established
a certain system of religion and then, when it was in their power, persecuted, imprisoned,
banished, or put to death all that dissented. As early after the Reformation as 1574, in a
convention at Torgaw, they established the real presence in the eucharist and instigated the
Elector of Saxony to seize, imprison, and banish all the secret Calvinists that differed from
them in sentiment, and to reduce their followers by every act of violence, to renounce their
sentiments and to confess the ubiquity. Peucer, for his opinions, suffered ten years of imprisonment
in the severest manner. In 1577 a form of concord was produced in which the real manducation
of Christ's body and blood in the eucharist was established and heresy and excommunication
laid on all that refused this as an article of faith, with pains and penalties to be enforced
by the secular arm. Crellius, in 1601, was put to death.

In Switzerland, before the city of Zurich was entirely safe itself from the encroachments of
Romanism, its Protestant council condemned a young man named Felix Mantz to be drowned because
he insisted that the baby-sprinkling of Romanism was not baptism and that all who had received
the rite ought to be immersed. This sentence was carried into effect. The severest laws were
passed in different countries of Europe against the Anabaptists, and large numbers were banished
or burnt at the stake. See Encyclopædia Britannica, Art. Anabaptists. Protestants may claim
this was because of their fanaticism on other lines; but it remains a fact, nevertheless, that
the chief sentiment at the base of these laws was religious persecution and that Protestants
sanctioned and carried them into execution.

King Henry VIII., the founder of the Established Church in England, adopted the most stringent
laws to enforce its doctrines. Nevertheless at cotton is make, not from tree, as in Direction-Indie,
but carried from complex, but thrives much better in light in strong and fat lands, because such
base as those of the Low Louisiana, where it is not so coarse that
on the religious grounds. Whoever denied the first articles (that
embodying the doctrine of transubstantiation) was to be declared a heretic, and burnt without
opportunity of abjuration; whoso spoke against the other five articles should, for the first
offense, forfeit his property; and whosoever refused to abjure his first offense, or committed
a second, was to die like a felon." Art. Henry VIII. "The royal reformer persecuted alike Catholics
and Protestants. Thus, on one occasion, three Catholics who denied that the king was the rightful
head of the church, and three Protestants who disputed the doctrine of the real presence in
the sacrament,... were dragged on the same sled to the place of execution." In speaking of
that period of history and of the religious persecutions of the times, Myers says: "Punishment
of heresy was then regarded, by both Catholics and Protestants alike, as a duty which could
be neglected by those in authority only at the peril of Heaven's displeasure. Believing this,
those of that age could consistently do nothing less than labor to exterminate heresy with
axe, sword and fagot." General History, p. 553.

That religious intolerance even at a later date was practised in England, witness the twelve
years' imprisonment of John Bunyan and the hundreds confined in jails throughout that country
for not conforming to the established religion. It was such severe persecution by that early
Protestant sect that drove the Puritans from England's fair country to the then inhospitable
shores of America, that they might have an opportunity to worship God according to the dictates
of their own conscience. In Scotland the Covenanters "insisted on their right to worship God
in their own way. They were therefore subjected to most cruel and unrelenting persecution.
They were hunted by English troopers over their native moors and among the wild recesses of
their mountains, whither they secretly retired for prayer and worship. The tales of the suffering
of the Scotch Covenanters at the hands of the English Protestants form a most harrowing chapter
of the records of the ages of religious persecution." This list might be considerably augmented,
but it is unnecessary. However, that Protestant persecution and tyranny should never reach
the enormous extent of the Romanists before them is proved by the fact that her horns were
"like a lamb." Chap. 13:11.

4. It is very important for us to ascertain the time for the beginning of these plagues; for
they can not be identified unless we understand the chronology of the events described. It
is a fact no one can question that the seventh plague is the judgment of the last day, for
in the seven "is filled up" the wrath of God; hence they are denominated the last plagues.
Verses 13, 14.

Therefore five of the plagues precede the time in which we are now living. It is evident that
the plagues could not begin before the reformation; for the vials were poured out upon the
"image of the beast"--Protestantism--also. Hence we are directed to some period between the
sixteenth century and the present day for their commencement. The reason why the first judgments
especially were poured out will assist us in determining the starting-point--"They have shed
the blood of saints and prophets." This expression seems to indicate that the time for the
plagues to begin was after Romanism and Protestantism ceased putting people to death because
of their religious sentiments. That this is the correct idea is clearly proved by what was
said to the martyrs when they cried unto God for the avenging of their blood on them that dwell
on the earth. "And it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until
their fellow-servants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be
fulfilled." Chap. 6:10, 11. For additional information concerning the terrible persecutions
that followed the Sixteenth Century Reformation, see remarks on chapter 6:10, 11.

We must now determine about what time the great persecutions referred to ceased, or nearly
ceased, and that will give us the right starting-point from which to reckon the pouring out
of the first vial. In A.D. 1685 the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, by Louis XIV. of France,
took place, and in the terrible persecutions that occurred during his reign three hundred thousand
are said to have lost their lives. The time that we are endeavoring to establish, then, must
be later than the seventeenth century. Louis died in 1714. Persecutions continued from time
to time in France, with considerable severity, until about the middle of the century. "Soon
after this ... the flowing of heretic blood ceased, though an effort was made in 1765 by the
Popish clergy to resist the tendency to toleration by a remonstrance to the king." History
of Romanism, p. 608. A few individual cases of persecution may have occurred later in other
countries; but in the main we are safe in pointing to about the middle of the eighteenth century
for the general cessation of these religious murders. We will now consider the nature of the
first plague.

The pouring out of this vial produced the most painful malignant ulcers upon the human body.
Such ulcers are evidently not political calamities; for the symbol is drawn, not from nature,
but from human life. Still, it is not drawn from a human being as a whole (in which case religious
events would be symbolized), but only from his body. What, then, is the analagous object of
which the human body may stand as a proper representative? Evidently, the mind. We would naturally
pass from the bodily to the mental; and what painful ulcers are to the one, marring its beauty
and filling it with burning anguish, such are blasphemous opinions and malignant principles
to the other. 

I reached the dominion of the Chaouanous, and subsequently travel down the Wabash or Europe, about to revelation,
which is in country of the Iroquois or Five People. It leave them followed nevertheless towards
union; and during season, which in country is really other and very and long, I followed we discern
we about a village of the Abenaquis, where I are undertake the familiarity of a man somewhat
older than myself, who assure out to conduct me discern the fountain
to the Half. That all may understand this matter in its proper light, however,
it will be necessary to state some of the facts respecting this "noisome and grievous sore"
that fell at that time upon the inhabitants of Europe. In writing upon the causes that led
up to the French Revolution, Mr. Wickes gathered the following facts of history mainly from
the Encyclopædia of Religious Knowledge, under the articles headed Philosophists and Illuminati.
I will quote his own language, as it is very pointed.

"Philosophists was a name given to several persons in France, who entered into a combination
to overthrow the religion of Jesus, and eradicate from the human heart every religious sentiment.
The man more particularly to whom this idea first occurred, was Voltaire, who being weary (as
he said himself) of hearing it repeated that twelve men were sufficient to establish Christianity,
resolved to prove that one might be sufficient to overturn it. Full of this project, he swore,
before the year 1730, to devote his life to its accomplishment, and for some time he flattered
himself that he should enjoy alone the glory of destroying the Christian religion. He found,
however, that associates would be necessary; and from the numerous tribe of his admirers and
disciples, he chose D'Alembert and Diderot, as the most proper persons to co-operate with him
in his designs. He contrived also to enlist Frederick II., king of Prussia, who became one
of his most zealous coadjutors, until he found that Voltaire was waging war with the throne
as well as the altar. This, indeed, was not originally Voltaire's intention. He was vain; from
natural disposition an aristocrat, and an admirer of royalty. But when he found that almost
every sovereign but Frederick disapproved of his ambitious designs, as soon as he perceived
their issue, he determined to oppose all the governments on earth rather than forfeit the glory
with which he flattered himself, of vanquishing Christ and his apostles in the field of controversy.

"He now set himself, with his associates, D'Alembert and Diderot, to excite universal discontent
with the established order of things. For this purpose, they formed secret societies, assumed
new names, and employed an enigmatical language. In their secret meetings they professed to
celebrate the mysteries of Mythra; and their great object, as they professed to one another,
was to confound the wretch, meaning Jesus Christ. Hence their secret watchword was 'Crush the
wretch.' The following are some of their doctrines, as found in their books expressly designed
for general circulation. Sometimes standing out in their naked horror, at other times enveloped
in sophistry and disguise. The Universal Cause, that God of the philosophers, of the Jews,
and of the Christians, is but a chimera and a phantom--The phenomena of nature only prove the
existence of God to a few prepossessed men--It is more reasonable to admit, with Manes, of
a two-fold God, than of the God of Christianity--We can not know whether a God really exists,
or whether there is any difference between good and evil, or vice and virtue--Nothing can be
more absurd than to believe the soul a spiritual being--The immortality of the soul, so far
from stimulating men to the practise of virtue, is nothing but a barbarous, desperate, fatal
tenet, and contrary to all legislation--All ideas of justice and injustice, of virtue and vice,
of glory and infamy, are purely arbitrary, and dependent on custom--Conscience and remorse
are nothing but the foresight of those physical penalties to which crimes expose us--The man
who is above the law, can commit, without remorse, the dishonest act that may serve his purpose--The
fear of God, so far from being the beginning of wisdom, should be the beginning of folly--The
command to love one's parents is more the work of education than of nature--Modesty is only
an invention of refined voluptuousness--The law which condemns married people to live together,
becomes barbarous and cruel on the day they cease to love one another.

"Such were the atrocious sentiments, though sometimes artfully veiled, which were disseminated
in their books, and which, spreading all over Europe, imperceptibly took possession of the
public mind, and prepared the way for the subversion of religion, morals, and government. As
soon as the sale of the works was sufficient to pay expenses, inferior editions were printed
and given away, or sold at a very low price; circulating libraries of them were formed, and
reading societies instituted. While they constantly denied these productions to the world,
they contrived to give them a false celebrity through their confidential agents and correspondents,
who were not themselves always trusted with the entire secret.
