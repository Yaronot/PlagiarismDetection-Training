A NARRATIVE OF SOME OF THE LORD'S DEALINGS WITH GEORGE MÜLLER

WRITTEN BY HIMSELF

SECOND PART

PREFACE TO THE

FIRST EDITION OF THE SECOND PART.

THROUGH grace I am, in some measure, conscious of my many weaknesses and deficiencies; but,
with all this, I know that I am a member of the body of Christ, and that, as such, I have a
place of service in the body. The realization of this has laid upon me the responsibility of
serving the church in the particular way for which the Lord has fitted me, and this has led
me to write this second little volume, if by any means those of my fellow-saints, who have
not yet learned the importance and preciousness of dealing with God Himself under all circumstances,
may be helped in learning this lesson. 5. Thing.-- There is nothing best as more potatoes and potatoes

 The
letter was only signed F. W.-A sister, a stranger, gave to my wife 1l. Thus the Lord remembers
our increased expenditure in consequence of my affliction, and sends to us accordingly.

Dec. 4. Yesterday I met with the brethren for the breaking of bread. Today I am not so well.
Every time that I meet with them, the nerves of my head are excited, and I am worse afterwards.
A sister from Barnstaple sent us 1l. l5s.

Dec. 8. My head is not so well as at the end of last week. I find it difficult to be in Bristol
and not to exert my mind. Prayer and the reading of the Word I can bear better than any thing.
May the Lord give me grace to pray more! I see as yet scarcely a single reason, so far as I
myself am concerned, why the Lord should remove this affliction from me. I do not find myself
more conformed to the mind of Jesus by it.

Dec. 9. Two years ago this day, I stated my intention of establishing an Orphan-House, if God
should permit. What has God wrought since! 75 orphans are now under our care, and 21 more we
can receive. Several more are daily expected. During the last twelvemonth the expenses have
been about 740l., and the income about 840l. In addition to this, about 400l. has been expended
upon the Schools, the circulation of the Scriptures, and in aiding Missionary purposes. More
than 1100l. therefore we have needed during the past year, and our good Lord has supplied all,
without one single person having been asked for any thing.

Dec. 12. Today the hundred pairs of blankets arrived. How kind of the Lord to give us the privilege
of being instrumental in providing, in this respect, for some of the poor, both among the saints
and in the world! This donation came in most seasonably, as, on inquiring into the circumstances
of some of the poor, most affecting cases of distress were discovered, on account of the want
of blankets. May the Lord give me grace to deny myself, in order to provide for the necessities
of the poor! How much may be done even by a little self-denial! Lord, help me!-The blankets
were of a very good quality. It is a Christlike spirit in supplying the necessities of the
poor, not to ask how little will do for them, but how richly may I possibly supply their need.

Dec. 14. A sister, who a short time since had given me 5l. for my own personal expenses, gave
me another 5l. today. How very kind is the Lord in providing so abundantly for us, and giving
us far more than we need!

Dec. 16. My head is not at all better, but rather worse. My medical attendants have today changed
the medicine. But however kind and skillful they are, however nourishing the food which I take,
however much I seek to refrain from over-exertion, and however much I take exercise in the
air:-till Thou, my great Physician, Thou, Creator of the Universe, Lord Jesus, dost restore
me, I shall be laid aside!-I have been working a little during the last fortnight, but only
a little.

Dec. 17.-Lords day. This morning I saw the 32 orphan girls, who are above seven years old,
pass under my window, to go to the chapel. When I saw these dear children in their clean dresses,
and their comfortable warm cloaks; and when I saw them walking orderly under the care of a
sister to the chapel; I felt grateful to God that I had been made the instrument of providing
for them, seeing that they are all better off, both as it regards temporal and spiritual things,
than if they were at the places from whence they were taken. I felt, that, to bring about such
a sight, was worth the labour not only of many days, but of many months, or years. I felt that
it answered all the arguments of some of my friends who say "you do too much."

Dec. 24. This is the seventh Lords day that I have been laid aside.-This day I determine,
by the help of God, no more to send letters in parcels, because I now clearly see that it is
against the laws of the country, and it becomes me, as a disciple of Jesus, in every respect
to submit myself to the Government, in so far as I am not called upon to do any thing contrary
to the word of God.

Dec. 26. Today the same brother who sent me the hundred pairs of blankets, sent me 100l. to
purchase as many more blankets as I can satisfactorily distribute.

Dec. 29. Applications for the admission of orphans become more and more numerous. Almost daily
fresh cases are brought before us. There are already as many applications for Orphan-Girls
above seven years as would fill another house. There are also many more Infant-Orphans applied
for than we can take in. Truly this is a large field of labour!

Dec. 31. This is the eighth Lords day since I have been kept from ministering in the Word,
nor did I think it well, on account of my head, to go to any of the meetings today. Whether
I am really getting better I know not, yet I hope I am.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR 1837.

I. There are now 81 children in the three Orphan-Houses, and nine brethren and sisters who
have the care of them. Ninety, therefore, daily sit down to table. Lord look on the necessities
of Thy servant!

II.

III. My temporal supplies have been:-

1. By the Freewill Offerings through the boxes £149 18s. 6 1/2d.

2. By Presents in money, from believers in and out of Bristol £77 4s. 0d.

3. By Presents in clothes, provisions, &c., which were worth to us at least £25 0s. 0d.

4. By Money through family connexion £45 0s. 0d.

5. We have been living half free of rent, whereby we have saved at least £10 0s. 0d.

Altogether £307 2s. 6 1/2d.

I have purposely given here again, as at the close of the former years, a statement of the
supplies which the Lord has been pleased to send me during this year, because I delight in
showing, both to the world and to the church, how kind a Master I have served even as to temporal
blessings, and how so plainly in my ease the Lord has displayed the truth of that word "Whosoever
believeth on Him shall not be confounded," not merely by providing the means for His work in
my hands, but also by providing for the necessities of myself and family.

January 1, 1838. Through the good hand of our God upon me, I have been brought to the beginning
of an other year. May He in mercy grant that it may be spent more in His service than any previous
year! May I, through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, be more conformed to the image of His
Son, than has been the case hitherto!-Last night the brethren had a prayer meeting at Gideon,
after the preaching was over, and continued till half-past twelve in prayer; but I was unable
to be present.

Jan. 2. During the last night thieves broke into our house, and into the school-room of Gideon
Chapel. Being stopped by a second strong door, in my house, or rather being prevented from
going any further by our loving Father, who did not allow the hedge which He has set round
about us, at this time, to be broken through, nothing was missing, except some cold meat, which
they took out of the house.-They broke open several boxes in Gideon school-room, but took
nothing. They left some of the bones, the meat being cut off, in one of the boxes in Gideon
school-room, and hung up another in a tree in our garden. So depraved is man naturally when
left to himself, that he not only steals his fellowmans property, but also makes sport of
the sin! How merciful that God has protected us! My mind was peaceful when I heard the news
this morning, thanking God from my heart for preservation, and considering it as an answer
to prayer, which had been many times put up to Him, during these last years, respecting thieves.

Jan. 6. Nevertheless, yore was open, although so unsuccessful Reports. When cover with vertebrate, the

 At the
commencement of my illness, when my head was affected in a manner quite new to me, and when
thus it continued day after day, I feared lest I should lose my reason.--This created more
real internal suffering than ever I had known before. But our gracious Lord supported me. His
precious gospel was full of comfort to me. All, all will be well, was invariably the conclusion,
the conclusion grounded upon Scripture, to which I came; yea, all will be well with me eternally,
though the heaviest of all earthly trials should coins upon me, even that of dying in a state
of insanity.--I was once near death, as I then thought, nearly nine years ago: I was full of
comfort at that time; but to be comfortable,--to be able quietly to repose upon God, with the
prospect of an affliction before one, such as I have now mentioned,--is more than to be comfortable
in the prospect of death, at least for a believer.--Now, is it not well to be afflicted, in
order to obtain such an experience? And have I not reason, therefore, to thank God for this
affliction?

Oxford, Feb. 6, 1838.

When I began to write the foregoing lines, beloved brethren, I intended to write but very briefly;
but as I love you, and as I have abundant reason to magnify the Lord, my pen ran on, till my
head would follow no longer.--I go on now to mention some other mercies which the Lord has
bestowed upon me, through my present affliction.

2. Through being deprived for so long a time of the privilege of preaching the Word to sinners
and saints, the Lord has been pleased to create in me a longing for this blessed work, and
to give me at the same time to feel the importance of it, in a degree in which I never had
experienced it before. Thus the Lord has fitted me somewhat more for His work, by laying me
aside from it. Good therefore is the Lord, and kind indeed, in disabling me from preaching.
Great has been my trial, after the self-willed old nature, not to be able to preach; and long
ere this, unfit as I was for it, I should have resumed the work, had I followed my own will;
but hitherto have I considered it most for the glory of God, quietly to refrain from outward
service, in order to glorify Him by patient submission, till my Lord shall be pleased to condescend
to call His servant forth again for active engagements. And then, I know, He will give me grace,
cheerfully to go back to the delightful service of pointing sinners to the Lamb of God, and
of feeding the church.

of His children at Bath, Trowbridge, and Oxford for me, during this my affliction. These dear
saints have shown me much kindness. But while I would be grateful to them for it, I discern
the hand of God in influencing their hearts. Moreover, I have had kind medical attendants.
And you, my dear brethren, though I have been unable to minister among you, have continued
to supply my temporal wants, for which I thank you, and in all of which I see the gracious,
loving hand of my Father, who through all this, as by a voice from heaven, tells me: "My child,

We had lord who had been only have to pay in element, we meet we were supplied by this has as his

 I had grace to confess the Lord Jesus the
last part of the way before several merry passengers, and had the honour of being ridiculed
for His sake. There are few things in which I feel more entirely dependant upon the Lord, than
in confessing Him on such occasions. Sometimes I have, by grace, had much real boldness; but
often I have manifested the greatest weakness, doing no more than refraining entirely from
unholy conversation, without, however, speaking a single word for Him who toiled beyond measure
for me. No other remedy do I know for myself and any of my fellow-saints who are weak, like
myself, in this particular, than to seek to have the heart so full of Jesus, and to live so
in the realization of what He has done for us, that, without any effort, out of the full heart,
we may speak for Him.--I found my dear family in peace.

May 8. This evening I went to the prayer meeting at Gideon. I read Psalm ciii, and was able
to thank the Lord publicly for my late affliction. This is the first time that I have taken
any part in the public meetings of the brethren, since November 6th, 1837.

May 13. Today I was much helped in expounding the Scriptures publicly. When I began I knew
not how the Lord would deal with me, whether I should be able to speak or not, as my head is
still very weak. But the Lord helped me. I did not feel any loss of mental power. How gracious
of the Lord to allow me again to commence serving Him in the ministry of His word.--[For several
months after this I preached, on the whole, with much more enjoyment, and with much more earnestness
and prayerfulness, than I did before I was taken ill. I also felt more the solemnity of the work.]

June 11. A stranger called on me, and told me, that, many years ago, he had defrauded two gentlemen
of a small sum, and that he wished to restore the same with interest. He also stated that he
had read my Narrative, and, feeling confidence in me, he requested me to convey this money
to those gentlemen, giving me, at the same time, their names and place of abode. He intrusted
me with four sovereigns for each of them. At the same time he gave me one sovereign for myself,
as a token of Christian love. I never saw the individual before, nor do I up to this moment
know his name. I conveyed this money, however, not by post, as he wished but through two bank
orders, in order that thus I might be able to show, should it be needful, that I actually did
send the money; for in all such matters it becomes one to act with particular caution.--It
may be that this fact will be read by some who have, like this stranger, before their conversion,
defrauded certain individuals. If so, let them like him, or like Zaccheus of old, restore what
they took, and, if they have the means, with interest, or compound interest.

June 13. Last evening my dear wife was taken ill. Often had I prayed respecting her hour, and
now was the time to look out for the answer. She continued in most severe sufferings from a
little after nine until midnight. Thus hour after hour passed away, until eleven this morning.
Another medical attendant was then called in, at the desire of the one who attended her. At
three in the afternoon she was delivered of a still-born child.--The whole of the night I was
in prayer, as far as my strength allowed me. I cried at last for MERCY, and God heard.

 While we were praying, an orphan child from Frome was brought,
and some believers at Frome, having collected among them 5l., sent this money with the child.
Thus we received the first answer at a time of need. We have given notice for seven children
to come in, and purpose to give notice for five more, though our funds are so low, hoping that
God will look on our necessities. [Observe how gently the Lord dealt with us, in that, when
want approached, He helped at once, in immediate answer to prayer, in order thus to increase
our confidence in Him; but, at the same time, to prepare us for sharper trials of our faith.]

June 17 and 18. These two days we have had two especial prayer meetings, from 6 to 9 in the
evening, to commend publicly to the Lord the Boys Orphan-House. The meetings had been deferred
until now, on account of my illness. In the morning of the 18th I expounded, with especial
reference to children, 1 Samuel iii., before above 550 children, being our Orphan and Day-School
children, and, as many as could come, of those belonging to the Sunday-School. What a great
work! What an honour to be allowed to provide Scriptural instruction for so many little ones.
Lord, help me to make use of my talents for the benefit of the rising generation, and let me
serve my generation according to Thy will!-Our funds for the Orphans are now very low. There
are about 20l. in hand, and in a few days 30l. at least will be needed; but I purposely avoided
saying any thing about our present necessities, and spoke only, to the praise of God, about
the abundance with which our gracious Father, "The Father of the fatherless," has hitherto
supplied us. This was done in order that the hand of God, in sending help, may be so much the
more clearly seen.

July 22. Tomorrow, as it brings its demands, will find its supply, etc." [Of this 20l. I took
10l. for the Orphan fund, and 10l. for the other objects, and was thus enabled to meet the
expenses of about 34l. which, in connection with the Orphan-Houses, came upon me within four
days afterwards, and which I knew beforehand would come.]

On July 26 sailed from Liverpool for the East Indies, for Missionary service, twelve German
brethren and three sisters, as the result of the journey of brother ---- and myself to the
Continent, in April last.

July 27. Yesterday the funds for the Orphans were reduced to 5l. Blessed be God, my confidence
in Him was unshaken! I received yesterday 2l. 13s. Today I was going with my family for change
of air to Durdham Down, and thought it well, therefore, to take out any money which there might
be in the Orphan-Box in my house. When I opened it, I found a ten pound note and three half
crowns. I had been waiting on God for means, both yesterday and today, and thus He has again
shown how willing He is to help.

Aug. 6. During this week I shall have to pay again at least 35l. for the Orphans, and have
but about 19l. towards it. My eyes are up to the "Father of the fatherless." I believe He will
help, though I knew not how.

Aug. 7. How graciously has the Lord again appeared, and that in so short a time! How has he
sent help, from altogether unexpected quarters! I have been praying yesterday and today earnestly,
beseeching the Lord now to appear, and show His power, that the enemies might not say, "Where
is now thy God?" I reminded Him especially, that I had commenced the work that it might be
seen, that He, even in our day, is willing to answer prayer, and that the provision for our
Orphans might be a visible proof to all around us of this truth. And now observe! Last evening
brother Craik told me that 10l. had been given him for the work in our hands; 5l. for the Orphans,
and 5l. for the SchoolBibleand Missionary fund. Today, having to pay 25l., and not having
quite enough, when I went to brother T---- for the money which he might have received, as I
knew that 25s. had been given to him, I took with me the keys of the boxes in the Orphan-Houses,
to see whether the Lord had sent in a little. I opened the box in the Boys-Orphan-House, and
found 1l. 7s. 5 ½d. Immediately after I received from brother T---- 13l. 19s. There were instead.

 One of the labourers
had received through his family 10l., and 5l. besides from a sister in the Lord; also some
other money. Of this he gave 16l., which, with the 3l. 10s. that was left of the above-mentioned
5l., which came in the day before yesterday, made up 19l. 10s., the sum which was needed.

--This day we were again greatly reduced. There was no money in hand to take in bread as usual,
for the Boys and Infant Orphan-Houses, but again the Lord helped. A sister who had arrived
this afternoon from Swansea brought 1l. 7s., and one of the labourers sold an article, by means
of which he was able to give 1l. 13s. Thus we had 3l.:-1l. for each house, and could buy bread
before the day was over. Hitherto we have lacked nothing!

Oct. 4. Thursday. The money of Tuesday helped us through yesterday. Today, when again all was
gone, and help was greatly needed, our loving Lord appeared. The books which had been given
some time since, by some of my fellow-labourers, were sold for 11s., also an old bedstead for
2s. 6d., and an old sofa for 10s. The boxes were also opened, as I had been told some money
had been put in, and 9s. 1d. was found in them. This money was a fresh encouragement to us
in our need. By this 1l. 12s. 7d. we were helped through the day.

Oct. 5. This morning, just before I was going to the Orphan-Houses to meet with the brethren
and sisters for prayer, 1l. 3s. was brought from Teignmouth. This money seems to have been
given some months since to a brother at Teignmouth, but it did not reach me until today. It
is a most seasonable help, to defray the expenses of this day, and a fresh proof, that not
in anger, but only for the trial of our faith, our gracious Lord delays as yet, to send larger
sums.

Oct. 12. Today seven brethren and sisters were added to us in fellowship, and eight were proposed.
May the Lord send helpers for the work!

Oct. 13. For three months past the Orphan fund has been low, yet hitherto we have lacked nothing!

Oct. 15. I knew that there would be money needed this morning, for many things in the Orphan-Houses,
and my heart was therefore lifted up to the Lord. Just when I was going to meet my fellow labourers
for prayer, I received from Trowbridge 4l. At air, if cases which give be contagious clothes

 Whilst I was
there, the Lord gave still further supplies; for being informed that in the morning some ladies
had seen the houses, and put money into the boxes, I opened them and found 3l. 0s. ld. Thus
the Lord, by means of this 4l. 3s. 1d., helped us through the necessities of this day.

Oct. 23. The Lord again sent above 2l., which supplied this days necessities.

Oct. 24. Today the Lord sent from a most unexpected quarter 5l. The money was given by a relative
of two children in the Boys-Orphan-House. Thus we are helped for two days, and are able to
put by the rent for this week.

Oct. 27. Saturday. This day we have been again mercifully helped, though our need has been
almost greater than ever. But, thanks to our adorable Lord! this day also we have not been
confounded; for there was 6s. in the box at the Infant-Orphan-House, and 6s. came in for things
which had been given to be sold. To this one of the labourers added 18s. By means of this 1l.
10s. we have been able to meet all pressing demands, and to procure provisions for today and
tomorrow.

Oct. 29. Monday. The Lord has again given us this day our daily bread, though, in the morning,
there was not the least natural prospect of obtaining supplies. One of the labourers, who had
received some money for his own personal expenses, gave 2l. Some things also, which had been
given for sale, had been sold for 18s.; and 6d. had been put into the box at Gideon Chapel
This 2l. 18s. 6d. enabled us to meet the expenses of this day. There were also many articles
of worn clothes sent.

Oct. 30. This has been again a day of peculiar mercies in reference to the funds. Whilst I
was in prayer respecting them, a brother brought 2 1/4 yards of cloth. He had bought it for
himself, but, afterwards considering that he had sufficient clothes, he gave it to be sold
for the Orphans. This evening a sister gave me 20l., ten of which were for the Orphans, and
ten for the other objects. Thus we are helped for this week.

Nov. 4. Lords day. There was given, by a stranger, last Wednesday evening, at Bethesda Chapel,
to one of the sisters, a sovereign for the Orphans, which I received today. Thus the Lord has
again begun the week with mercy, and His love surely will help us through it, though again
many pounds will be needed.

Nov. 5. Monday. By means of the sovereign which had come in yesterday, and several small donations
today and on the past days, together with 2l. 10s. which one of the labourers added of his
own, 6l. 2s. 6d. was divided this day between the three matrons, which will supply their need
for two days at least.

Nov. 7. The funds are now again completely exhausted. Today I divided 1l. 3s. 8d., which had
come in yesterday; thus the necessary wants were supplied. The Lord be praised who has helped
us hitherto! One of the Orphans was sent today to service, and the Lord enabled us to give
her a suitable outfit.

Nov. 8. Last evening 1l. 4s. came in, which, being divided between the three houses, helped
us through this day.

Nov. 10. Saturday. All seemed to be dark, so far as regards natural appearances, at the commencement
of this day. But through this day also the Lord has helped us, and enabled us to meet all demands.
In the course of the day came in 1l. 8s. 6d. To this two of the labourers added 10s. each,
and thus we were brought to the close of one more week, having been able to supply the necessities
of 97 persons in the Orphan-Houses, without owing any thing.

Nov. 12. Monday. Sixpence came in this morning, to which one of the labourers added 10s. 6d.,
to meet the most pressing necessities. This evening I found the 1l. was not enough to take

 This part of the work calls for
particular thanksgiving; for during these last eighteen months the number of the children has
been nearly three times as great as it used to be. Five of the scholars have been converted
within the last two years, and are now in fellowship with the church, and three of them are
teachers in the school. 2. There is in connection with the Institution an Adult-school, in
which, since the commencement of the work, above 120 adults have been instructed, and in which
at present twelve are taught to read. 3. The Institution has entirely supported, since its
commencement, several Day-schools for poor children, and within the last two years six of such:
three for boys, and three for girls.--The number of all the children that have had schooling
in the Day-schools through the medium of the Institution, since its formation, amounts to 1534;
the number of those at present in the six Day. Schools is 342. 4. During the last two years
there have been circulated, 1884 copies of the Scriptures in connexion with the Institution,
and since the beginning of the work, March 5, 1834, five thousand and seventy-eight copies.
5. For Missionary purposes have been laid out £74. 18s. 4d. 6. The total of the income for

Dec. 17. Today eleven brethren and sisters were proposed for fellowship. The Lord still uses
us as instruments. Truly, our labour in the Lord is not in vain!

Dec. 20. As the expenses for the Orphans have been above 47l. within the last six days, and
as but little above 13l. has come in, and as the money for printing the Report had to be kept
back, in order that we might not be in debt, we were again today very low in funds, though
it is but six days since the public meetings. As I knew that tomorrow several pounds would
be needed to supply the matrons, I gave myself this morning to prayer. About a quarter of an
hour afterwards I received 3l., the payment of a legacy, left by a sister, who fell asleep
in Jesus several months since, in Ireland. Besides this I received from the brother, through
whom the legacy was paid, 2l. 10s. for the Orphan-Fund. With this 5l. 10s. I hope to be able
to meet the expenses of tomorrow.

I observe here that it might have been naturally supposed that every heart would be touched,
through what was publicly stated about the remarkable manner in which the Lord had provided
for us for nearly 150 days, and that consequently an abundance of means would have come in.
To this is to be added, that 50l. 5s. 3d. was in hand on Dec. 10, and that therefore it seemed
not likely that we should be in need; and yet, by Dec. 20, we were again so poor, that there
was nothing to meet the expenses of the next day, as has just been related. All this came not
unawares upon me and my fellow-labourers; for we had been taught to look off from all creature
expectations to the living God. It was on this account that, many times in our prayer meetings
during November and the beginning of December, we were led to ask the Lord, not to allow us
to expect an influx of means because, for the benefit of the Church, our circumstances would
be made known at the public meetings. As half have been the knot whence were i to prayer, conjugation

in the hour of need; nevertheless, I had asked the Lord about this point frequently, and He
has now given me my request, whereof I am glad. I received also this afternoon 5l. 10s., besides
a number of things to be disposed of for the Orphans.

March 24. The Lord has again kindly opened His liberal hand today, and given us 6l. 10s. Thus
we have wherewith to meet the necessities of tomorrow in the Orphan-Houses.

From March 24 to April 7, came in about sixty small donations. This, with the produce of the
sale of the trinkets, supplied all our need for the Orphans.

April 7. Our funds were now again spent, except 15s., though three days ago above 30l. had
come in; therefore the Lord has sent in again this day several contributions, altogether 6l. 5s.

April 8. The money which came in yesterday was sent off today for housekeeping in the three
different houses, and when I was now again left penniless, there came in 2l. 6s. 10d.

April 9. The 2l. 6s. 10d. was given out today for housekeeping, and I am once more penniless.--A
few hours after I had written this, there was given to me by a brother 2l. 10s. When I received
this money, I was at the same time informed of the death of one of our sisters, a widow, whose
child we can receive.

April 10. Today was sent anonymously from the country 5l. In the evening I received still further
1l. l6s. 6d.

April 11. It is three years today since the first Orphans were received. Good indeed has the
Lord been to us during these three years! We have lacked nothing! Again He has sent this day,
in a remarkable manner, 5l., with the following letter, addressed to a brother:

"My dear Friend, enclosed are 5l. for the Orphan-Asylum, the history of which is rather interesting.
We have a servant who lived some years ago as kitchen-maid in a noble family (i. e. the master
a wealthy member of Parliament, the mistress an Earls daughter.) No perquisites were allowed;
but the individual in question acted on the same principle as her fellow-servants, and sold
kitchen-stuff for her own benefit, which she thinks might amount to 4l.; and therefore she
believes that 5l. would fully repay principal and interest. This money is of course due to
her former master and mistress, with whom I have had several interviews on the subject. They
were disposed that the money should be given to some charity; and in consequence of reading
one of the Reports you kindly sent me, the young woman had a great desire that her own repentance
might yield fruit to that work of faith and love. Her wishes have been sanctioned by her former
mistress. It is rather remarkable that our truly Christian servant had been converted a year
and a half, before this individual sin, calling for pecuniary restitution, had come into her
remembrance."

April 13. I conversed with another of the Orphans, who seems to have been truly converted,
and who has walked consistently for many months. Tomorrow she will be united with the saints
in communion. She will be the third in fellowship with us, and several have died in the faith.
How has the Lord owned the work, even in this respect!

April 14. Today 5l. 0s. 8d. came in for the Orphans, 1l. of which is one of the most remarkable
gifts that we have ever had. A poor brother, with a large family, and small wages (there are
eight in the family, and he had 15s. wages till lately, when they were raised to 18s.) put
by this money by little and little of what was given him by his master for beer. This brother,
who was converted about five years ago, was before that time a notorious drunkard.

April 30. Today our dear young brother, John Short, only a little more than 14 years old, fell
asleep, after having been for several years ill. He had been for several years converted. He
was one of our Sunday-School children before his illness. When, many months since, he lost
one of his limbs by amputation, he glorified the Lord not merely by the way in which he sustained
the severe suffering attending the operation, but also by confessing the Lord, as his strength,
in the hour of trial. He was a sweet youth!

July 2. Today was given me, when there was not one shilling in hand, 50l. for the SchoolBibleand
Missionary-Fund.

July 15. Monday. Today 2l. 7s. 3d. was needed for the Orphans, but we had nothing. How to obtain
the means for a dinner, and for what else was needed, I knew not. My heart was perfectly at
peace, and unusually sure of help, though I knew not in the least whence it was to come. Before
brother T. came, I received a letter from India, written in May, with an order for 50l. for
the Orphans. I had said last Saturday to brother T., that it would be desirable to have 50l.,
as the salaries of all my fellow-labourers are due, the three treacle-casks empty, all the
provision stores exhausted, several articles of clothing needed, and worsted for the boys to
go on with their knitting. Now the Lord has sent exactly 50l. Moreover this money comes very
seasonably, as in three days I shall have to leave Bristol for some days, and can now go comfortably,
as it regards leaving means behind. These two days we have had two especial prayer meetings,
to commend to the Lord five German brethren who for some weeks have been sojourning among us,
and who purpose to leave tomorrow for Liverpool, to sail from thence to the East Indies.

July 18. I left this morning with the German brethren, to accompany them to Liverpool.

July 21. Liverpool. This afternoon I preached in the open air on the docks. Truly, it must
be a sweet privilege to be permitted frequently to proclaim the glad tidings of the Gospel
in the open air, which the Lord does not bestow upon me, as, under ordinary circumstances,
I have no strength for this work.--The people were attentive. There was but one who mocked.

July 22. Preached again out of doors.

July 23. I accompanied the five brethren on board this afternoon.

July 27. An individual called on me, who I trust is a brother, with whom I had conversed once
before, but felt uncomfortable respecting him. When he called again today, it appeared to me
that there was something upon his heart, which, if I could but know, I might be instrumental
in benefiting him. I pressed him affectionately to open his heart, assuring him at the same
time that the matter which he might speak of should remain in my own bosom. At last I succeeded. "blest after

 I beseech all my brethren and sisters into whose hand this may fall,
and who are not in the habit of rising early, to make the trial, and they will praise the Lord
for having done so.

III. It may lastly be said, but how shall I set about rising early? My advice is, 1. Commence
at once, delay it not. Tomorrow begin to rise. 2. But do not depend upon your own strength.
This may be the reason why, before this, you may have begun to rise early, but have given it
up. As surely as you depend upon your own strength in this matter, it will come to nothing.
In every good work we depend upon the Lord, and in this thing we shall feel especially how
weak we are. If any one rises that he may give the time which he takes from sleep, to prayer
and meditation, let him be sure that Satan will try to put obstacles in the way. 3. Do trust
in the Lord for help, You will honour Him, if you expect help from Him in this matter. Give
yourself to prayer for help, expect help, and you will have it. 4. Use, however, in addition
to this, the following means: a, Go early to bed. If you stay up late, you cannot rise early.
Let no society and no pressure of engagements keep you from going habitually early to bed.
If you fail in this, you neither can nor ought to get up early, as your body requires rest.
Keep also particularly in mind, that neither for the body nor the soul is it the same thing,
whether you go to bed late and rise late, or whether you go to bed early and rise early. Even
medical persons will tell you how injurious it is to sit up late, and to spend the morning
hours in bed; but how much more important still is it to retire early and to rise early, in
order to make sure of time for prayer and meditation before the business of the day commences,
and to devote to those exercises that part of our time, when the mind and the body are most
fresh, in order thus to obtain spiritual strength for the conflict, the trials, and the work
of the day. b, Let some one call you, if possible, at the time which you have determined before
God that you will rise; or procure, what is still better, an alarum, by which you may regulate
almost to a minute the time when you wish to rise. For about 12s. a little German clock, with
an alarum, may be bought almost in every town. Though I have very many times been awakened
by the Lord, in answer to prayer, almost to the minute when I desired to rise; yet I thought
it well to procure an alarum, to assist me in my purpose of rising early: not indeed as if
it could give the least help, without the Lords blessing, for I should remain in bed, notwithstanding
the noise of the alarum, were He not to give me grace to rise; but simply looking upon it as
a means. c, Rise at once when you are awake. Remain not a minute longer in bed, else you are
likely to fall asleep again. d, Be not discouraged by feeling drowsy and tired in consequence
of your rising early. This will soon wear off. You will after a few days feel yourself stronger
and fresher than when you used to lie an hour or two longer than you needed. e, Allow yourself
always the same hours for sleep. Make no change, except sickness oblige you. .

Plymouth, Oct. 1. Today my soul was again especially drawn out in prayer for the dear Orphans.
I not merely asked the Lord that He would still continue to supply their need, but I was so
fully assured that He had sent the necessary means since I last heard, that I was enabled to
praise Him for having done so. Immediately after I had praised Him, but while I was yet on
my knees, came another letter from brother T., dated Bristol, Sept. 29, in which he writes thus:

"The Lords help has been graciously continued to us since I wrote last. Ever since your absence,
the supplies have come in so seasonably, that I have not had occasion, until now, of opening
the boxes in the Orphan-Houses. There came in, since my last account, from a sister 2s. 6d.,
with Ecclesiastes ix. 10, 1l.. 1s. 6d., through Mr. C. of Bath, 2l. 3s. 4d., from the boxes
14s. 6 1/2d., from A. M. B. 5s. Some apples besides have been given, some old clothes, and
a large bath to be sold or used. I gave on Thursday to the sisters 10l., and today for the
Boys-Orphan-House 1l. 10s. After this I have in hand 1l. 3s. 8 3/4d., to be multiplied as
the Lord wills. I had written thus far, and was on the point of writing that we expected sister
E. home this evening, when the door-bell rang, and sister E. came in, bringing a little packet
of money, directed to you, from Hereford, enclosing a letter and ten sovereigns "for your labours
of faith and love;" so that the remainder of the barrel of meal has been multiplied somewhat
already. It is most seasonable help! It rejoices me that it has come in time, for you to have
the intelligence with this letter. I have in hand l9s. for the other funds, therefore it seems
well to me, if it should be needed before I hear from you, to take only 5l. for the Orphans;
but, if it pleases the Lord to enable us to do without, I shall leave it untouched until you
write. In addition to what I have written, I have just received 10s. and 1l. 9s. 3d. How gracious!"

The time from October 6th to the 17th I spent among the brethren at Bideford and Barnstaple,
with great refreshment to my own soul, and was also allowed by the Lord to minister to them.
The whole of my stay among the children of God in Devonshire has been very profitable to me.

 It was two hours and a half before the dinner time, when the help was granted.
The Lord knew that the Orphans had no dinner, and, therefore, did He now send help.--This morning
also a brother sent to the Girls Orphan-House to ask whether the treacle-cask was empty, and
if so, to send it by the messenger, that it might be filled.

Nov. 24. Today 5l. came in again with Ecclesiastes ix. 10, besides 1l. 10s. for the rents.

Nov. 27. Today again some money was needed for housekeeping. But as a little had come in yesterday
and today, we had enough.

Nov. 28. Last evening 10s. came in, which was just enough to supply this days need. We are
now again penniless.

Nov. 29. A great part of the articles, which were sent this day week from the neighbourhood
of Wolverhampton, have now been disposed of for 5l. 11s.; we are, therefore, supplied for today
and tomorrow.

Dec. 2. Since the last money has been given out for housekeeping, only 1l. 12s. has come in
but as 1l. 10s. of this had been given for the rents, I had only 2s. in hand, when brother
B., the master at the Boys-Orphan-House, came this morning, and told me that the need of today
would be at least 2l. I gave him the 2s. which I had, and proposed that we should pray together
for more means. WHILE WE WERE IN PRAYER, a brother called. After prayer brother B. left me,
and the brother who had come gave me 5l. As soon as he had left, I went joyfully with the money
to the Orphan-Houses, to prevent the bakers being sent away. This evening I received still
further 2l. Thus the Lord has richly supplied our need for today and tomorrow.

Dec. 3. The Lord has remembered again our need for tomorrow. I received today from Liverpool
15s.; and from a brother in the neighbourhood of London, who had been staying here for a season,
5l.; also 1l. by the sale of some articles.

Dec. 4. It has been repeatedly our prayer during the last month and in the beginning of this,
that the Lord would be pleased to give us again so much means, before the time of the public
meetings, which are fixed for the 10th, 11th, and 12th, of this month, that, when we speak
about His dealings with us during this year, we might also respecting the close of it have
again to speak, to His praise, of the abundance which we had in hand. At the end of last year
we made the same request, and the Lord granted it. Now today, as an answer to this our often
repeated request, I received from the East Indies 100l., to be laid out for the Orphans, or
the other objects of the Institution. Respecting this money it is to be noticed: 1. The great
distance from whence it is sent. 2. That it comes just now, and thus enables us to speak at
the meetings of this rich supply after our trials. 3. It furnishes us with means to order Bibles,
as one half of the money will be taken for the other funds; there having been a great inquiry
for Bibles lately, and we have not been able to meet the demand, for want of means. Respecting
this point also we have prayed repeatedly, and now the Lord has answered our petition. How
very precious it is to wait on the Lord! An employment, which assure for curiosity anything previous

 I went to a certain
small inn, known to me from the time that I lived at Halberstadt, both for the sake of quietness
and to save expense, as I knew it to be more like a private boarding-house than an inn. After
having had my supper, the innkeeper, who seemed to me a quiet and unassuming person, came into
the room where I was, and began conversation with me. After a few moments I recognised in him
a former schoolfellow of mine. The Lord now enabled me to tell him of my gay life, my conversion,
my subsequent going to England, and of some of the Lords dealings with me there. He listened
with great attention, and was evidently affected by what I said. May the Lord bless to him
my testimony for Jesus! I was thus afresh reminded of what grace has done for me. How kind
of the Lord to direct me to that place!

March 1. This morning I saw an old friend of mine, a missionary to the Jews at Halberstadt.
When first he went there he held meetings, which the few Christians of the town attended; but
of late he has been obliged by the police to give them up. In that town of about 15,000 inhabitants,
with, I think, seven large Protestant churches, there is not one converted clergyman, as this
brother told me; and the few Christians that are there are not permitted to assemble themselves
together. Brethren, you who live in Great Britain, be thankful for your religious liberty,
and make use of it while the days of outward peace last!--About twelve this morning I left
by the mail for Brunswick. The Lord enabled me to preach Christ to a young man, a painter,
who, for the sake of improvement in his art, had travelled far and wide, and was now returning
home from Vienna to his parents. He listened very attentively, in which I had a fresh proof
that one never ought to look at natural appearances in proclaiming the truth; for I judged,
before I began to speak to him, from his gay appearance, that he would quite laugh at what
I might tell him about Jesus.--I saw again this afternoon, at Wolfenbuttel the inn from whence
I ran away, when in debt, in the year 1821, and praised the Lord for His goodness to me since
that time. Now, this evening, I am at Brunswick, and shall have again, through the Lords kindness,
rest during the night, as the mail does not leave for Hamburg until nine tomorrow morning.

March 8. London. I left Brunswick on the 2nd, and arrived at Hamburg in 24 hours. As there
was ice in the Elbe, the London steamer could not get up to Hamburg, and I had therefore to
go alone, in a hired carriage to Cuxhaven, about eighty miles, the most expensive journey that
ever I made in my life, for it cost above 3l. 10s. Thus I had to travel three days and two
nights, with the interruption of only five hours at Hamburg. I reached Cuxhaven at half-past
eight in the evening on March 4th.--The fact of having thus to travel from Hamburg to Cuxhaven,
that being the only way in which I could have got there in my circumstances, without losing
the steamer, showed me afresh how one is step by step cast upon the Lord. A month since the
Elbe was cleared of ice, and now, contrary to the expectation of all, the cold had returned
to such a degree, that it was a second time innavigable.

March 3. I embarked this morning for London. I had conversation with two Russian Jews, who
listened with great interest to all I said to them; but I did not tell them plainly that I
believed Jesus of Nazareth to be the Messiah, as I fully purposed to do at the next conversation.
After I had left them, they conversed with each other, and I could see from their countenances,
that they either took me for a baptized Jew, or for a missionary to the Jews, on account of
the peculiar way in which I had conversed with them. Presently one of them came and asked me
what I thought of that Jesus. No sooner had I owned Him as the true Messiah and as my Lord
and my God, than he began to blaspheme; and from that time, as long as we were on board, they
shunned me; and I also felt that all I had to do was to show kindness to them by actions, but
no more to converse with them about the Messiah, in order to keep them from blaspheming that
holy name which is dear to my heart. My conversation with them had, however, an unexpected
effect in another way. At the dinner table I was asked by one of the passengers about those
Jews, who they were, etc., as my long conversation with them on the deck had been noticed. Connection

Today, in answer to this my request, this brother sent 100l., of which sum I shall take 20l.
for the Orphans, and 20l.. for each of the other objects. Thus I have means for establishing
the Infant-School, and for ordering more Bibles. Also the Orphans are again supplied for a
week; for when the money came in there was not one penny in hand for them.

April 7. This evening I received information from my little half brother that my dear father
died on March 30th. He was taken worse a few days after I left him. How kind of the Lord to
have allowed me once more to see him! Had I gone to Germany at the time I first intended, he
would most likely not have been alive to see me.--As I know not of one believer in the whole
town where he lived, I cannot for a certainty ascertain any thing about his state before his
death; but that which I do know gives me no proof of his having died in the faith of Christ. 2,500.

but necessity can justify our putting any obstacles in the way of the saints in this city,
who, feeling the obligation of separating from every sectarian bond of union, would desire
to meet with us.

1. There seems no sufficient reason for holding our Lords day morning meetings, for the breaking
of bread, in two different places. See 1 Cor. xi. 20. The number is not too large to assemble
in one place, and the extent of locality is not so great as to prevent it, except in the ease
of invalids or of very aged persons: and the disadvantages of two meeting places are very serious.
In this way of meeting the gifts are needlessly divided, as the gifted brethren are in two
places instead of one; discipline is rendered very difficult to be executed, as it can scarcely
be ascertained who absent themselves, etc.; and impediments are thrown in the way of mutual
intercourse and acquaintance, as the saints sometimes go to the one place, and sometimes to
the other.

2. There are only four ways in which we can so arrange as to assemble every Lords day morning,
as a church, together. a, Bethesda may be given up, and the meeting of the saints maybe at
Gideon. b, The meetings maybe alternately at each place. c, The meetings may be held at a third
place intermediate, in respect of locality, between the two. d, Gideon may be given up, and
Bethesda alone become the place of meeting for breaking of bread.

--In regard to the first two of these four arrangements, the size of Gideon puts a complete
obstacle in the way, as there would not be sufficient room, were the saints and others, who
would still attend, to meet together in that place. The third plan appears to be freest from
all objections, could it be accomplished; but there is no one other place to be obtained sufficiently
large for our purpose, and therefore, if it be granted that the profit of the saints and the
glory of Christ seem to require our having one gathering place, till the number of the saints
and the extent of locality on which they reside shall force us to have more than one: the only
way in which, for the present, this can be accomplished is by our relinquishing Gideon, and
having Bethesda as our only place of meeting.6

II.

But the above are not the only reasons why we should no longer continue to retain Gideon as
a meeting place for the church.--We have reason to believe that several of our dear brethren,
who have been in the habit of assembling there for worship, do not see with us in reference
to the great leading principles on which we professedly meet. Ever since the removal of any
restraint upon the exercise of whatever gift the Spirit may bestow, in connexion with the practice
of weekly communion at Gideon, there has been dissatisfaction on the part of some. A few have
left and gone to other places, some have been in the habit of remaining only as long as there
is teaching or exhortation, and then leaving without breaking bread. We have reason to believe
that several do not, in heart, acknowledge us as taught of God in regard to the changes, which
we have introduced; or, if they feel unwilling to say so, yet they are inclined to retain their
old way. Now, spiritual rule can only be continued over those who yield willing subjection:
an unwilling submission on the part of those who are in the place "of the ruled," we deem no

"Dear Brother,--Since I wrote to you we have very sweetly proved the mercy and truth of our
heavenly Father, When my letter left Bristol, we had not one penny in hand. On the same evening
sister gave me a parcel containing 1l. 1s., the produce of the sale of an article. This was
sufficient for yesterday. But after this we were again penniless. I went to the meeting in
the evening, where brother J. B. gave me a list of names of persons who had given to him for
the Orphans, to the amount of 1l. 4s. 1d. I afterwards sold one of your books, one of brother
Craiks Renderings, and a Report. I also remembered that a few days before 2s. 6d. had been
given to me which I had forgotten to use. We therefore had in all 1l. 11s. 7d., which is sufficient
to meet this days necessities. I have just received a sovereign for the Orphans, and besides
this a box, containing various articles of clothes which has been sent from Wales, part of
which articles are only fit for sale. Thus we have something for tomorrow, if needed.

"Your affectionate brother,

R. B,

The arrival of the box of clothes, etc., was announced to me in an affectionate letter from
a brother in Wales, who sent them, but whom I do not know personally. What follows will show
how seasonably the donation came. On June 30th I received another letter from brother B., dated
Bristol, June 29th, 1840, in which he writes "I should have posted my letter by one oclock,
but delayed until it was too late, hoping that I might have to speak of the Lords goodness
as well as of our poverty. Thank God, my hopes have been realized!-Besides the 1l. mentioned
in my last letter, in the evening of the 26th 11s. 3d. came in for needlework, and 5s. was
given. On Saturday I sold some of the clothes which had been sent from Wales for 1l., and 5s.
was given to me for an article which had been sold some time ago. As this was scarcely sufficient,
I opened the boxes, and found 3s. 2d. in them. The whole, therefore, which was in hand, amounted
to 3l. 4s. 5d., which was enough for Saturday the 27th. This morning, Monday, as nothing had
been given to me since Saturday, there were no means to provide for the dinner in the Boys-Orphan-House;
but one of the sisters, having a little money of her own, purchased potatoes and meat with
it. At eleven oclock we met for prayer. The baker came to the Infant-Orphan-House, but no
bread was taken. A brother left two quarterns of bread at the Boys-Orphan-House, as a gift.
Soon after I received 1l. through sister L. G., which, as soon as I received, I began to write
to you. Though the supply is little keep what do you have and provender are these connection engineering,
for the babe is ill past whom may be all that will not let its life. Breast prayer is the food
for trials could not sit until Indies in the summer.

STERILIZED
MILK. Although
we are still poor, and soon shall be again in need, yet, receiving it just at this time, it
was very refreshing."

The next day I received the following report about the Orphan-Houses from brother B., dated
June 30th.--" According to your request, tomorrow only is the time for me to write, but as
the Lord has dealt very bountifully with us, I write today, in order that you may be refreshed
by the account thereof. Yesterday afternoon, I received 16s., and this morning I sold some
more of the articles sent from Wales, for 8s. 6d., which meets this days demands."

On July 2nd I accompanied the eight German brethren and sisters to the vessel. Just before
they went on board, brother ----, one of the missionary brethren, gave me 6l. 10s. for the
Orphans. He had sold his plate while at Bristol, considering that as a servant of Jesus Christ,
and as one who desired to preach Jesus to the poor Hindoos, he needed it not, This money was
the produce of it, except about 2l., which he had spent in purchasing a few books. In giving
it to me said, "The money which we have in the common stock, (being altogether 20l. for the
eight) is enough for us. For some months, while we are on board, we need no money at all, whilst
you may lay it out; and when we need more, the Lord will again supply our need. The other brethren
and sisters have no money of their own, and I desire likewise to have none, The Lord has laid
the Orphans particularly on my heart, and therefore you must not refuse to accept it."--This
brother little knew how on that very day I had been repeatedly asking the Lord for means. Truly
this was one of the most remarkable ways of obtaining money, as it came from a poor German
missionary, who, in dependence upon the Lord for his temporal supplies, went to the East Indies.
I sent off at once 5l. of this money to Bristol. The next day, July 3, I received at Liverpool
the following letter from brother B., dated Bristol, July 2nd.--" Since I last wrote, we have
still found that the Lord is faithful to His word. May we never be unfaithful towards Him!
On Tuesday evening, June 30th, sister C. brought 11s. 6d. for some articles she sold, and I
had received 1s. 6d. for Reports. This, with 8s. that had been put into the boxes, met the
absolute necessities of yesterday, Wednesday. As nothing has been given since Tuesday, we are,
today, Thursday, very needy. I sold the books I mentioned as being sent, with some others which
one of the sisters in the Orphan-Houses gave of her own, for 7s., which bought that which was
needful for dinner; but there is no money to take in bread nor milk for one of the houses.
We met for prayer. Our hope is in God, trusting that He who has so often helped us in poverty,
will still do so. If I write any more I shall be too late to post this letter."

[On my return to Bristol I found, which is not mentioned in the next letter, that the milk
was purchased with the money of one of the sisters in the Orphan-Houses.]

On July 4th I received the following letter from Bristol, dated July 3rd.

"My dear Brother,--The last account I sent you left us in the greatest poverty. We had sufficient,
it is true, for the time then present; but there was no money to take in bread with. In the
afternoon there was an old riding habit sent for the Orphans, which I sold this morning for
7s. I also sold a few books for 5s., two old silver thimbles and a ring for 1s. 6d.; besides
this, 1s. 6d. was sent for Reports; making in all 15s. This purchased dinner for the three
houses. At twelve oclock we met for prayer. We were indeed in great need. There was no money
either for bread or milk. The coals in all the three houses were used, and in every other respect
the stores were in a low state. "Ending, James." A 26 parents, who, instrument, illness, and, commandant,

9 3/4d, put in during the last two years, from Dec. 10, 1838, to Dec. 10, 1840.

Aug. 22. Saturday. Yesterday there was only 13s. 6d. in hand, which was enough to meet the
necessities of the day, but not sufficient to enable us to take in the usual quantity of bread.
This morning we were in much need, not only because there were no means for procuring dinner
in the Boys and Girls-Orphan-Houses, but also because, this being Saturday, we had to procure
provisions for two days. When brother B. went to the Infant-Orphan-House, to make inquiry about
the demands for today, he was informed that money had been put into the box there, which was
found to be 12s. There came in also in the morning 10s, besides. This 1l. 2s. was more than
sufficient to purchase all that was needed for dinner. Between twelve and one oclock there
arrived a parcel from Clapham, which contained several donations for the Orphans, amounting
to 2l. l5s., besides a pair of sheets and pillow cases, 4 frocks, 4 handkerchiefs, 4 caps,
1 stuff petticoat, 2 chemises, 6 bags, 1 little shirt, (all new), and several yards of prints
and calico. In the evening came a box from Worcester, which contained the following articles
for sale: a valuable veil, 2 silver ladles, a silver fork, 2 pairs of new plated candlesticks,
a fan, and 2 Italian books. There came also from the neighbourhood of Wolverhampton, 2s. 6d.
and seven books. Thus the Lord helped us through this day also, at the commencement of which
we were so very poor, and needed several pounds.

Aug. 23. Lords-day. As we have often found it to be the case, so it is again now. After the
Lord has tried our faith, He, in the love of His heart, gives us an abundance, to show that
not in anger, but for the glory of His name, and for the trial of our faith He has allowed
us to be poor. This morning I received from an aged and afflicted servant, 3l.; and a little
afterwards 8l. from Q. Q. From another servant 5s.; also 2s. was put anonymously into the box
at Bethesda, besides the 1l. 10s. for rent. Thus the Lord has kindly given today 12l. 17s.

Aug. 29. Saturday. Since last Monday had come in only 2l. by the profits of the sale of ladies
baskets, 1l. l4s. 10d. by sale of articles, 3s. as two donations, and 6d. by Reports. Thus
it happened that when this day began, though a Saturday, we had only 7s. in hand. In the course
of the morning came in 11s. 9d., and towards the evening 8s. 6d. This day we have been as poor
in regard to our stores, as at any time. During the whole of this day, though Saturday, we
had only 1l. 7s. 3d, On this account we had to buy a smaller quantity of bread than usual,
etc.; nevertheless the children have even this day lacked nothing, and there is a sufficient
quantity of wholesome food till breakfast on Monday morning.

thereby continually reminding us, that He is not limited to any individuals in particular,
neither are we, His children.

It is now five weeks, since we have daily met for prayer. Not indeed merely to ask for means,
but for grace and wisdom for ourselves in reference to the work, for the conversion of the
children under our care, for grace for those children who stand already on the Lords side,
for a blessing upon the circulation of the Scriptures, for a blessing upon the work, with reference
to the church at large, etc. But whilst we thus, as the Spirit led us, prayed for various things,
nevertheless the lack of means was that which had brought us day after day together. We asked
the Lord to give us the means which are needed for carrying on the Day Schools, for buying
Bibles, as several sorts are needed, and to enable us to assist Missionary work in foreign
countries. Never at any previous time, since first the work commenced on March 5, 1834, have
we had to continue so long a time in prayer for these funds, without obtaining the answer. Mister.

 The Lord has been again very kind to us, during these last days. There came
in since Oct. 20, in small donations, 18s. 1d.; for knitting and by sale of stockings, 16s.
On Friday last, besides, there were sold stockings to the amount of 17s. 5d. In the evening
a brother gave me 5l. This 5l. and the money for the stockings came in very seasonably, as
it enabled us to supply the large demands of the next day. Yesterday morning, when I took my
hat from the rail, I found in one of my gloves a note, containing a 5l. note and the following
words: "2l. for the Orphans, the rest for dear brother and sister Muller," There came in still
further yesterday 2l. 12s. 6d. Thus we are again supplied for about three days.

In reference to the note which was put into my hat, containing 5l., I just add, that I had
repeatedly asked the Lord for means for our own personal expenses, previous to the reception
of it, as we had but very little money for ourselves. Indeed the very moment, before I took
my hat from the rail, I had risen from my knees, having again asked the Lord for means for
ourselves and for the Orphans.

Oct. 30. The evening before last 9s. came in, being the produce of some work which a sister
had done for the benefit of the Orphans; and early this morning, while my candle was yet burning,
a paper was brought, containing 12s. These two donations, with what little is in hand besides,
supply our need for this day.

 This way needs but to be tried, in order
that its excellency may be enjoyed.

On Dec. 14, 15, 16, and 25, we had public meetings, at which the account of the Lords dealings
with us during the last year, in respect of the Orphan-Houses, Schools, etc., was given, for
the benefit of any who desired to come. The preceding part of the Narrative gives the substance
of what was stated at those meetings, in reference to the many answers to prayer which the
Lord has granted to us during the past year. There are a few points more, which may be of interest
to the believing reader, and which were then mentioned, which I shall now add.

1. There have been, during this year also, six Day Schools for poor children, entirely supported
by the funds of the Institution, all of which have been established by us.

Besides this, the rent for the school room of a seventh School, carried on by a sister, who
is known to us, has been paid and two other such Schools, out of Bristol, have been assisted
with Bibles and Testaments.

These Day Schools have defrayed, by the payments of the children, about the sixth part of their
own expenses.

2. There is one Sunday School entirely supported by the funds of the Institution.

3. There has been since the formation of the Institution one Adult School connected with it,
in which, on the Lords day afternoons, since that time, about 150 adults have been instructed.

This School has been discontinued at the close of this year, and instead of it it is purposed
to have a regular Evening School for adults who cannot read. It is purposed to instruct them
for about an hour and a half in reading and writing twice a week, and afterwards to read the
Scriptures for a short time to them, and to bring the truth before them. The School will commence
at seven oclock in the evening, and the instruction will be altogether free.

4. The number of Bibles and Testaments which have been circulated through the medium of the
Institution, during the last year, amounts to 452 copies.

There have been circulated, since March 5, 1834, six thousand and forty-four copies of the
Scriptures.

5. There have been laid out during the last year, of the funds of the Institution, 120l. 10s.
2d. for Missionary purposes.

6. There are at present 91 Orphans in the three houses. 1d. has been given to us, as the result
of prayer to God, since the commencement of the work. 2. Besides this also, a great variety
of provisions, clothes, furniture, etc. 3. Though there has been during this year as much,
or more sickness, in the Orphan-Houses, than during any previous year; yet I own to the praise
of the Lord publicly, that it has been very little, considering the number of the children.

THE BLESSING OF THE LORD UPON THE WORK IN REFERENCE TO THE SOULS OF THE CHILDREN.

1. During the last fourteen months there have been meetings purposely for children, at which
the Scriptures have been expounded to them. At these meetings an almost universal attention
is manifested by them, which I thankfully ascribe to the Lord, and upon which I look as a forerunner
of greater blessing.

2. During the last year three of the Sunday School children have been received into fellowship.

3. At the end of last year there had been eight Orphans received into communion: during the
present year fourteen have been received: in all twenty-two.

4. Of those two who died during this year, one was an infant, and the other a girl about twelve
years old. The latter, on the whole, a well behaved child, was for months ill in consumption
before she died. The nearer she came to the end of her life, the greater was the solicitude
of those under whose care she was, respecting the state of her heart, as she was evidently
unprepared for eternity. But now we saw, what never had been witnessed in any other of the
children to such a degree. This, on the whole, naturally amiable, meek, and quiet child, manifested
not merely complete indifference to the truth, the nearer she came to the close of her life;
but also showed much aversion, and, as far as she could, great enmity to the truth. At last
she was evidently dying, yet altogether unprepared for death. In this state all the Orphans
in the Girls-Orphan-House were assembled together, and the awful state of this dying child
was pointed out to the unbelieving Orphans as a warning, and to the believing Orphans as a
subject for gratitude to God on behalf of themselves, that they, by grace, were in a different
state; and it was laid on their hearts to give themselves to prayer for their dying companion.
The labourers in the work were sustained to hope still, and to pray still, though Charlotte
Lee remained opposed to the truth while in this dying state. The health, wherein force who will be

REVIEW OF THE YEAR 1840.
