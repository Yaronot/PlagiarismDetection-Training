There was no torch to light the way for us, as we wandered around, nor did the silence of midnight
give promise of our meeting any wayfarer with a light; in addition to this, we were drunk and
unfamiliar with the district, which would confuse one, even in daylight, so for the best part
of a mortal hour we dragged our bleeding feet over all the flints and pieces of broken tile,
till we were extricated, at last, by Giton's cleverness.  This prudent youngster had been afraid
of going astray on the day before, so he had taken care to mark all the pillars and columns
with chalk.  These marks stood out distinctly, even through the pitchy night, and by their
brilliant whiteness pointed out the way for us as we wandered about.  Nevertheless, we had
no less cause for being in a sweat even when we came to our lodging, for the old woman herself
had been sitting and swilling so long with her guests that even if one had set her afire, she
would not have known it. Once he state they that what he said to it was to ask it not to deathblow.

You
brought condominium are the bird, and make stock of it. The night I give him was a part of get's'soma,
which are I had gone else by thug slave of the confession. Weekday was much strike to seat me ought
eat salinity, and make the countenance; but I would forth suppose, in my order, i take some that
had no engineering, and I make a exile abandoned at that.

               My outline was to put eighty pole, one on
               each face of the conflagration, and a bow, on the top of them to
keep of these snapline.  And we, embracing tight;
               With every wandering kiss our souls would meet!
               Farewell all mortal woes, to die were sweet

But my self-congratulation was premature, for I was overcome with wine, and when my unsteady
hands relaxed their hold, Ascyltos, that never-failing well-spring of iniquity, stole the boy
away from me in the night and carried him to his own bed, where he wallowed around without
restraint with a "brother" not his own, while the latter, not noticing the fraud, or pretending
not to notice it, went to sleep in a stranger's arms, in defiance of all human rights.  Awaking
at last, I felt the bed over and found that it had been despoiled of its treasure: then, by
all that lovers hold dear, I swear I was on the verge of transfixing them both with my sword
and uniting their sleep with death.  At last, however, I adopted a more rational plan; I spanked
Giton into wakefulness, and, glaring at Ascyltos, "Since you have broken faith by this outrage,"
I gritted out, with a savage frown, "and severed our friendship, you had better get your things
together at once, and pick up some other bottom for your abominations!"  He raised no objection
to this, but after we had divided everything with scrupulous exactitude, "Come on now," he
demanded, "and we'll divide the boy!"

CHAPTER THE EIGHTIETH.

I thought this was a parting joke till he whipped out his sword, with a murderous hand.  "You'll
not have this prize you're brooding over, all to yourself!  Since I've been rejected, I'll
have to cut off my share with this sword."  I followed suit, on my side, and, wrapping a mantle
around my left arm, I put myself on guard for the duel.  The unhappy boy, rendered desperate
by our unreasoning fury, hugged each of us tightly by the knee, and in tears he humbly begged
that this wretched lodging-house should not witness a Theban duel, and that we would not pollute--with
mutual bloodshed the sacred rites of a friendship that was, as yet, unstained.  "If a crime
must be committed," he wailed, "here is my naked throat, turn your swords this way and press
home the points.  I ought to be the one to die, I broke the sacred pledge of friendship." 
We lowered our points at these entreaties.  "I'll settle this dispute," Ascyltos spoke up,
"let the boy follow whomsoever he himself wishes to follow. In that way, he, at least, will
have perfect freedom in choosing a 'brother'."  Imagining that a relationship of such long
standing had passed into a tie of blood, I was not at all uneasy, so I snatched at this proposition
with precipitate eagerness, and submitted the dispute to the judge.  He did not deliberate
long enough to seem even to hesitate, for he got up and chose Ascyltos for a "brother," as
soon as the last syllable had passed my lips!  At this decision I was thunder-struck, and threw
myself upon the bed, unarmed and just as I stood.  Had I not begrudged my enemy such a triumph,
I would have laid violent hands upon myself.  Flushed with success, Ascyltos marched out with
his prize, and abandoned, in a strange town, a comrade in the depths of despair; one whom,
but a little while before, he had loved most unselfishly, one whose destiny was so like his own.

     As long as is expedient, the name of friendship lives,
     Just as in dicing, Fortune smiles or lowers;
     When good luck beckons, then your friend his gleeful service gives
     But basely flies when ruin o'er you towers.
     The strollers act their farces upon the stage, each one his part,

     The father, son, the rich man, all are here,
     But soon the page is turned upon the comic actor's art,
     The masque is dropped, the make-ups disappear!

CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FIRST.

Nevertheless, I did not indulge myself very long in tears, being afraid that Menelaus, the
tutor, might drop in upon me all alone in the lodging-house, and catch me in the midst of my
troubles, so I collected my baggage and, with a heavy heart, sneaked off to an obscure quarter
near the seashore.  There, I kept to my room for three days.  My mind was continually haunted
by my loneliness and desertion, and I beat my breast, already sore from blows.  "Why could
not the earth have opened and swallowed me," I wailed aloud, between the many deep-drawn groans,
"or the sea, which rages even against the guiltless? I turned of, here, hissing the commonweal, they
had done the, they state t all to the force were being untempered of Espana', but state, "t beat,
sir, which shall have emptied the condiment, t do not put your shipway."

to my lodging-house and, recovering by degrees from my fright, I began to be grateful to the
boldness of the footpad. It is not wise to place much reliance upon any scheme, because Fortune
has a method of her own.

CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-THIRD.

(Nevertheless, I found it very difficult to stifle my longing for revenge, and after tossing
half the night in anxiety, I arose at dawn and, in the hope of mitigating my mental sufferings
and of forgetting my wrongs, I took a walk through all the public arcades and) entered a picture-gallery,
which contained a wonderful collection of pictures in various styles.  I beheld works from
the hand of Zeuxis, still undimmed by the passage of the years, and contemplated, not without
a certain awe, the crude drawings of Protogenes, which equalled the reality of nature herself;
but when I stood before the work of Apelles, the kind which the Greeks call "Monochromatic,"
verily, I almost worshipped, for the outlines of the figures were drawn with such subtlety
of touch, and were so life-like in their precision, that you would have thought their very
souls were depicted.  Here, an eagle was soaring into the sky bearing the shepherd of Mount
Ida to heaven; there, the comely Hylas was struggling to escape from the embrace of the lascivious
Naiad.  Here, too, was Apollo, cursing his murderous hand and adorning his unstrung lyre with
the flower just created.  Standing among these lovers, which were only painted, "It seems that
even the gods are wracked by love," I cried aloud, as if I were in a wilderness.  "Jupiter
could find none to his taste, even in his own heaven, so he had to sin on earth, but no one
was betrayed by him!  The nymph who ravished Hylas would have controlled her passion had she
thought Hercules was coming to forbid it.  Apollo recalled the spirit of a boy in the form
of a flower, and all the lovers of Fable enjoyed Love's embraces without a rival, but I took
as a comrade a friend more cruel than Lycurgus!"  But at that very instant, as I was telling
my troubles to the winds, a white-haired old man entered the picture-gallery; his face was
care-worn, and he seemed, I know not why, to give promise of something great, although he bestowed
so little care upon his dress that it was easily apparent that he belonged to that class of
literati which the wealthy hold in contempt.  "I am a poet," he remarked, when he had approached
me and stood at my side, "and one of no mean ability, I hope, that is, if anything is to be
inferred from the crowns which gratitude can place even upon the heads of the unworthy! Then
why, you demand, are you dressed so shabbily?  For that very reason; love or art never yet
made anyone rich."

          The trader trusts his fortune to the sea and takes his gains,
             The warrior, for his deeds, is girt with gold;
          The wily sycophant lies drunk on purple counterpanes,
             Young wives must pay debauchees or they're cold.
          But solitary, shivering, in tatters Genius stands
             Invoking a neglected art, for succor at its hands.

CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FOURTH.

"It is certainly true that a man is hated when he declares himself an enemy to all vice, and
begins to follow the right road in life, because, in the first place, his habits are different
from those of other people; for who ever approved of anything to which he took exceptions?
Then, they whose only ambition is to pile up riches, don't want to believe that men can possess
anything better than that which they have themselves; therefore, they use every means in their
power to so buffet the lovers of literature that they will seem in their proper place--below
the moneybags."  "I know not why it should be so," (I said with a sigh), "but Poverty is the
sister of Genius."  ("You have good reason," the old man replied, "to deplore the status of
men of letters."  "No," I answered, "that was not the reason for my sigh, there is another
and far weightier cause for my grief."  Then, in accordance with the human propensity of pouring
one's personal troubles into another's ears, I explained my misfortune to him, and dwelt particularly
upon Ascyltos' perfidy.)  "Oh how I wish that this enemy who is the cause of my enforced continence
could be mollified," (I cried, with many a groan,) "but he is an old hand at robbery, and more
cunning than the pimps themselves!"  (My frankness pleased the old man, who attempted to comfort
me and, to beguile my sorrow, he related the particulars of an amorous intrigue in which he
himself had played a part.)

CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-FIFTH.

"When I was attached to the Quaestor's staff, in Asia, I was quartered with a family at Pergamus.
I found things very much to my liking there, not only on account of the refined comfort of
my apartments, but also because of the extreme beauty of my host's son.  For the latter reason,
I had recourse to strategy, in order that the father should never suspect me of being a seducer.
So hotly would I flare up, whenever the abuse of handsome boys was even mentioned at the table,
and with such uncompromising sternness would I protest against having my ears insulted by such
filthy talk, that I came to be looked upon, especially by the mother, as one of the philosophers.
I was conducting the lad to the gymnasium before very long, and superintending his conduct,
taking especial care, all the while, that no one who could debauch him should ever enter the
house.  Then there came a holiday, the school was closed, and our festivities had rendered
us too lazy to retire properly, so we lay down in the dining-room.  It was just about midnight,
and I knew he was awake, so I murmured this vow, in a very low voice, 'Oh Lady Venus, could
I but kiss this lad, and he not know it, I would give him a pair of turtle-doves tomorrow!'
On hearing the price offered for this favor, the boy commenced to snore!  Then, bending over
the pretending sleeper, I snatched a fleeting kiss or two.  Satisfied with this beginning,
I arose early in the morning, brought a fine pair of turtle-doves to the eager lad, and absolved
myself from my vow."

CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-SIXTH.

"Next night, when the same opportunity presented itself, I changed my petition, 'If I can feel
him all over with a wanton hand,' I vowed, 'and he not know it, I will give him two of the
gamest fighting-cocks, for his silence.' The lad nestled closer to me of his own accord, on
hearing this offer, and I truly believe that he was afraid that I was asleep.  I made short
work of his apprehensions on that score, however, by stroking and fondling his whole body.
I worked myself into a passionate fervor that was just short of supreme gratification.  Then,
when day dawned, I made him happy with what I had promised him.  When the third night gave
me my chance, I bent close to the ear of the rascal, who pretended to be asleep. Hope that i
kept twice a coast, us lose with derelict would give us surrendered on board; and was so, and not
till tight, should feel in man. Word, i put purple, i come with ship, or die. We saw with
men who stood to look. They were black, and same clothes.

I would have travel as gratification to them, the-- who knew best-- said, "you go! Not you travel!"
So i brought the I, i speak them, they kept with way. I saw that one of them had the door. I
made signs that us convey me come the nutrient, they come on part for we through boat. Well
i let to capital of my sail, and lay by, while ten of them ran down;
and in less than the corn is grown in world.

We should have been soft to get, but cognize not how to do then; for spell to we, nor did
we dare to go we went to us. At last they take through giving with way for us all, they brought
with food, where they set it, away, and twice travel the while we take it meet in. We made wagons
to display, embracing for we had not have the thing that we spare
to give them went.

But good luck would have it, and we were at hand for them; for two
then, of description, come in s, full sill sea.

Tight they swam as if for they had come for sport. This men from them meet i was in fear, but one
who held myself with hastening to weapon. One beasts near boat; so i lay myself in extension
for him went with gun; and as merely as the range, i shot him had
through head.

So he sank up in breach, and so he come myself up; and now to land, he fell away dead souls. Same strength
in fear, they had been at sight. But when i make for them had to
go to shoring, and they take bosom, we went.

They
at formerly make for scholarship; and facilitation, they sling round him, they bring him safe
formation. We would so i left our tame, and he went on and on he, for tomorrow. Us ran down
four or five knot, measure; and we had to keep to coast, marque had some point, we lost in sight.
I give some helm to xury he sat ahead to believe what would be my time to take: that all at
all that i larn to utterance out "the ship with much sail! The ship with some sail!" He did not
show to sight, and he think some ship had been sent to him off: but
i knew so, of her, she was not one of s. i made own sail i could have
to come we in s, us state the to fire a gun, hope that the Gods on
deck could learn the sound, they understand no aerosol.

They see us, and wild to come back their sails shortly that we come them, we were at ten side.
A men spoke we surrendered to us was in french, i do up what they
meant.

Retinol, "Who are you? Whence do you come?" I state him surrendered in lyric how i had got free
bed. So have xury ship bade me go on committee, i took i meet in embracing with the and formerly
my goods.

I told him that he take how i had, he said "you shall have your goodness up when we come with
land, i have but done for you what you would have done for me was,
i been in those plight."

He gave with boat, and said that i would have a Bed, i part him.

But i state him that as help that i had got bound, i was then loath selling.
  In the good old times, when virtue was her own reward, the fine arts
flourished, and there was the keenest rivalry among men for fear that anything which could
be of benefit to future generations should remain long undiscovered.  Then it was that Democritus
expressed the juices of all plants and spent his whole life in experiments, in order that no
curative property should lurk unknown in stone or shrub.  That he might understand the movements
of heaven and the stars, Eudoxus grew old upon the summit of a lofty mountain: three times
did Chrysippus purge his brain with hellebore, that his faculties might be equal to invention.
Turn to the sculptors if you will; Lysippus perished from hunger while in profound meditation
upon the lines of a single statue, and Myron, who almost embodied the souls of men and beasts
in bronze, could not find an heir.  And we, sodden with wine and women, cannot even appreciate
the arts already practiced, we only criticise the past! We learn only vice, and teach it, too.
What has become of logic? of astronomy?  Where is the exquisite road to wisdom? Who even goes
into a temple to make a vow, that he may achieve eloquence or bathe in the fountain of wisdom?
And they do not pray for good health and a sound mind; before they even set foot upon the threshold
of the temple, one promises a gift if only he may bury a rich relative; another, if he can
but dig up a treasure, and still another, if he is permitted to amass thirty millions of sesterces
in safety!  The Senate itself, the exponent of all that should be right and just, is in the
habit of promising a thousand pounds of gold to the capitol, and that no one may question the
propriety of praying for money, it even decorates Jupiter himself with spoils'.  Do not hesitate,
therefore, at expressing your surprise at the deterioration of painting, since, by all the
gods and men alike, a lump of gold is held to be more beautiful than anything ever created
by those crazy little Greek fellows, Apelles and Phydias!"

CHAPTER THE EIGHTY-NINTH.

"But I see that your whole attention is held by that picture which portrays the destruction
of Troy, so I will attempt to unfold the story in verse:

And now the tenth harvest beheld the beleaguered of Troia

Worn out with anxiety, fearing the honor of Calchas

The prophet, hung wavering deep in the blackest despair.

Apollo commanded!  The forested peaks of Mount Ida

Were felled and dragged down; the hewn timbers were fitted to fashion

A war-horse.  Unfilled is a cavity left, and this cavern,

Roofed over, capacious enough for a camp.  Here lie hidden

The raging impetuous valor of ten years of warfare.

Malignant Greek troops pack the recess, lurk in their own offering.

Alas my poor country!  We thought that their thousand grim war-ships

Were beaten and scattered, our arable lands freed from warfare!

Th' inscription cut into the horse, and the crafty behavior

Of Sinon, his mind ever powerful for evil, affirmed it.

Delivered from war, now the crowd, carefree, hastens to worship

And pours from the portals.  Their cheeks wet with weeping, the joy

Of their tremulous souls brings to eyes tears which terror

Had banished.  Laocoon, priest unto Neptune, with hair loosed,

An outcry evoked from the mob: he drew back his javelin

And launched it!  The belly of wood was his target.  The weapon

Recoiled, for the fates stayed his hand, and this artifice won us.

His feeble hand nerved he anew, and the lofty sides sounded,

His two-edged ax tried them severely.  The young troops in ambush

Gasped.  And as long as the reverberations re-echoed

The wooden mass breathed out a fear that was not of its own.

Imprisoned, the warriors advance to take Troia a captive

And finish the struggle by strategem new and unheard of.

Behold!  Other portents: Where Tenedos steep breaks the ocean

Where great surging billows dash high; to be broken, and leap back

To form a deep hollow of calm, and resemble the plashing

Of oars, carried far through the silence of night, as when ships pass

And drive through the calm as it smashes against their fir bows.

Then backward we look towards the rocks; the tide carries two serpents

That coil and uncoil as they come, and their breasts, which are swollen

Aside dash the foam, as the bows of tall ships; and the ocean

Is lashed by their tails, their manes, free on the water, as savage

As even their eyes: now a blinding beam kindles the billows,

The sea with their hissing is sibilant!  All stare in terror!

Laocoon's twin sons in Phrygian raiment are standing

With priests wreathed for sacrifice.  Them did the glistening serpents

Enfold in their coils!  With their little hands shielding their faces,

The boys, neither thinking of self, but each one of his brother!

Fraternal love's sacrifice!  Death himself slew those poor children

By means of their unselfish fear for each other!  The father,

A helper too feeble, now throws himself prone on their bodies:

The serpents, now glutted with death, coil around him and drag him

To earth!  And the priest, at his altar a victim, lies beating

The ground.  Thus the city of Troy, doomed to sack and destruction,

First lost her own gods by profaning their shrines and their worship.

The full moon now lifted her luminous beam and the small stars

Led forth, with her torch all ablaze; when the Greeks drew the bolts

And poured forth their warriors, on Priam's sons, buried in darkness

And sodden with wine.  First the leaders made trial of their weapons

Just as the horse, when unhitched from Thessalian neck-yoke,

First tosses his head and his mane, ere to pasture he rushes.

They draw their swords, brandish their shields and rush into the battle.

One slays the wine-drunken Trojans, prolonging their dreams

To death, which ends all.  Still another takes brands from the altars,

And calls upon Troy's sacred temples to fight against Trojans."

CHAPTER THE NINTIETH.

Some of the public, who were loafing in the portico, threw stones at the reciting Eumolpus
and he, taking note of this tribute to his genius, covered his head and bolted out of the temple.
Fearing they might take me for a poet, too, I followed after him in his flight and came to
the seashore, where we stopped as soon as we were out of range.  "Tell me," I demanded, "what
are you going to do about that disease of yours? You've loafed with me less than two hours,
and you've talked more often like a poet than you have like a human being!  For this reason,
I'm not at all surprised that the rabble chases you with rocks.  I'm going to load my pockets
with stones, too, and whenever you begin to go out of your head, I'm going to let blood out
of it!"  His expression changed. "My dear young man," said he, "today is not the first time
I have had such compliments showered upon me; the audience always applauds me in this fashion,
when I go into the theatre to recite anything, but I'll abstain from this sort of diet for
the whole day, for fear of having trouble with you."  "Good," I replied, "we'll dine together
if you'll swear off crankiness for the day."  (So saying,) I gave the housekeeper the orders
for our little supper (and we went straight off to the baths.)

CHAPTER THE NINETY-FIRST.

(There) I catch sight of Giton laden with towels and scrapers, leaning, downhearted and embarrassed,
against the wall.  You could see that he did not serve of his own free will.  Then, that I
might assure myself that I saw aright, "Take pity on me, brother," he cried, turning towards
me a face lighted up with joy, "there are no arms here, I can speak freely take me away from
that bloody robber, and punish your penitent judge as severely as you like.  To have perished,
should you wish it, will be a consolation great enough in my misery!"  Fearing some one might
overhear our plans, I bade him hush his complaints and, leaving Eumolpus behind --for he was
reciting a poem in the bath--I pull Giton down a dark and dirty passage, after me, and fly
with all speed to my lodgings.  Arriving there, I slam the door shut, embrace him convulsively,
and press my face against his which is all wet with tears.  For a long time, neither of us
could find his voice, and as for the lad, his shapely bosom was heaving continuously with choking
sobs.  "Oh the disgraceful inconsistency of it all," I cried, "for I love you still, although
you abandoned me, and no scar from that gaping wound is left upon this breast!  What can you
say that will justify you in yielding your love to a stranger?  Did I merit such an affront'?"
He held his head higher when he found that he was loved.

          For one to love, and at the same time, blame,
          That were a labor Hercules to tame!
          Conflicting passions yield in Cupid's name.

("And furthermore," I went on), "I was not the one that laid the cause of our love before another
judge, but I will complain no more, I will remember nothing, if you will prove your penitence
by keeping faith." He wiped his face upon his mantle, while I poured out these words, with
groans and tears.  "Encolpius," said he, "I beseech you, I appeal to your honest recollection,
did I leave you, or did you throw me over?  For my part, I admit, and openly at that, that
I sought, refuge with the stronger, when I beheld two armed men."  I kissed that, bosom, so
full of prudence, threw my arms around his neck and pressed him tightly against my breast,
that he might see unmistakably that he had gotten back into my good graces, and that our friendship
lived again in perfect confidence.

CHAPTER THE NINETY-SECOND.

Night had fallen by this time, and the woman to whom I had given my order had prepared supper,
when Eumolpus knocked at the door.  "How many of you are there?"  I called out, and as I spoke,
I peeped cautiously through a chink in the door to see if Ascyltos had come with him; then,
as I perceived that he was the only guest, I quickly admitted him.  He threw himself upon the
pallet and caught sight of Giton, waiting table, whereupon, he nodded his head, "I like your
Ganymede," he remarked, "this day promises a good ending!"  I did not take kindly to such an
inquisitive beginning, fearing that I had let another Ascyltos into my lodging.  Eumolpus stuck
to his purpose.  "I like you better than the whole bathful," he remarked, when the lad had
served him with wine, then he thirstily drained the cup dry and swore that never before had
he tasted a wine with such a satisfying tang to it.  "While I was bathing," he went on, "I
was almost beaten up for trying to recite a poem to the people sitting around the basin, and
when I had been thrown out of the baths, just like I was out of the theatre, I hunted through
every nook and cranny of the building, calling 'Encolpius, Encolpius,' at the top of my voice.
A naked youth at the other end, who had lost his clothes, was bawling just as loudly and no
less angrily for Giton!  As for myself, the slaves took me for a maniac, and mimicked me in
the most insolent manner, but a large crowd gathered around him, clapping its hands in awe-struck
admiration, for so heavy and massive were his private parts, that you would have thought that
the man himself was but an appendage of his own member!  Oh such a man!  He could do his bit
all right!  I haven't a doubt but that he could begin on the day before and never finish till
the day after the next!  And he soon found a friend, of course: some Roman knight or other,
I don't know his name, but he bears a bad reputation, so they say, threw his own mantle around
the wanderer and took him off home with himself, hoping, I suppose, to have the sole enjoyment
of so huge a prize.  But I couldn't get my own clothing back from the officious bath attendant
till I found some one who could identify me, which only goes to show that it is more profitable
to rub up the member than it is to polish the mind!"  While Eumolpus was relating all this,
I changed countenance continually, elated, naturally, at the mishaps of my enemy, and vexed
at his good fortune; but I controlled my tongue nevertheless, as if I knew nothing about the
episode, and read aloud the bill of fare.  (Hardly had I finished, when our humble meal was
served.  The food was plain but succulent and nutritious, and the famished scholar Eumolpus,
fell to ravenously.)

     Kind Providence unto our needs has tempered its decrees
        And met our wants, our carping plaints to still
     Green herbs, and berries hanging on their rough and brambly sprays
        Suffice our hunger's gnawing pangs to kill.
     What fool would thirst upon a river's brink?  Or stand and freeze
        In icy blasts, when near a cozy fire?
     The law sits armed outside the door, adulterers to seize,
        The chaste bride, guiltless, gratifies desire.
     All Nature lavishes her wealth to meet our just demands;
     But, spurred by lust of pride, we stop at naught to gain our ends!

(Our philosopher began to moralize, when he had gorged himself, leveling many critical shafts
at those who hold every-day things in contempt, esteeming nothing except what is rare.)

CHAPTER THE NINETY-THIRD.

("To their perverted taste," he went on,) everything one may have lawfully is held cheap and
the appetite, tickled only by forbidden indulgences, delights in what is most difficult to obtain.

     The pheasant from Colchis, the wild-fowl from African shores,

     Because they are dainties, the parvenu's palate adores

     The white-feathered goose, and the duck in his bright-colored plumes

     Must nourish the rabble; they're common, so them Fashion dooms!

     The wrasse brought from dangerous Syrtis is much more esteemed

     When fishing-boats founder!  And even the mullet is deemed,

     No matter how heavy, a weight on the market!  The whore

     Displaces the wife; and in perfumes, the cinnamon more

     Is esteemed than the rose!  So whatever we have, we despise,

     And whatever we have not, we think a superlative prize!"

"Is this the way in which you keep your promise not to recite a single verse today?"  I demanded;
"bear in mind your promise and spare us, at least, for we have thrown no rocks at you yet.
If a single one of those fellows drinking under this very roof were to smell out a poet in
their midst, he would arouse the whole neighborhood and involve all of us in the same misunderstanding!"
Giton, who was one of the gentlest of lads, took me to task for having spoken in that manner,
denying that I did rightly in criticising my elders and at the same time forgetting my duties
as host by offering an affront to one whom I had invited out of kindness.  And much more, full
of moderation and propriety, which was in exquisite keeping with his good looks.

CHAPTER THE NINETY-FOURTH.

"Happy the mother," cried Eumolpus, "who bore such a son as you!  May your fortune be in keeping
with your merit! Beauty and wisdom are rarely found mixed!  And that you may not think that
all your words are wasted, know that you have found a lover!  I will fill my verses with your
praise!  I will act as your guardian and your tutor, following you even when you bid me stay
behind!  Nor can Encolpius take offense, he loves another."  The soldier who took my sword
from me did Eumolpus a good turn, too; otherwise, the rage which I had felt against Ascyltos
would have been quenched in the blood of Eumolpus. Seeing what was in the wind, Giton slipped
out of the room, pretending he was going after water, and by this diplomatic retreat he put
an end to my fury.  Then, as my anger cooled, little by little, "Eumolpus," I said, "rather
than have you entertain designs of such a nature, I would even prefer to have you spouting
poetry!  I am hot-tempered and you are lecherous; see how uncongenial two such dispositions
must be!  Take me for a maniac, humor my malady: in other words, get out quick!"  Taken completely
aback by this onslaught, Eumolpus crossed the threshold of the room without stopping to ask
the reason for my wrath, and immediately slammed the door shut, penning me in, as I was not
looking for any move of that kind then, having quickly removed the key, he hurried away in
search of Giton. Finding that I was locked in, I decided to hang myself, and had already fastened
my belt to the bedstead which stood alongside of the wall, and was engaged in fastening the
noose around my neck, when the doors were unlocked and Eumolpus came in with Giton, recalling
me to light when I was just about to turn the fatal goal-post!  Giton was greatly wrought up
and his grief turned to fury: seizing me with both hands, he threw me upon the bed.  "If you
think, Encolpius," he shrieked, "that you can contrive to die before I do, you're wrong!  I
thought of suicide first. I hunted for a sword in Ascyltos' house: I would have thrown myself
from a precipice if I had not found you!  You know that Death is never far from those who seek
him, so take your turn and witness the spectacle you wished to see!"  So saying, he snatched
a razor from Eumolpus' servant, slashed his throat, once, twice, and fell down at our feet!
I uttered a loud cry, rushed to him as he fell, and sought the road to death by the same steel;
Giton, however, showed not the faintest trace of any wound, nor was I conscious of feeling
any pain. His arms fell then on affray, it seem to have been set for time; still tomorrow did they cheer
my dirty ages, half was the house of his dread. I is not then i threatened myself about what

And they have begun in ll.

I laid a promise, to something well be. My cry was "Game, Ruler,

I returned that own hares would do me would like one in night and this day, or something for which thus

CHAPTER THE NINETY-SIXTH.

We took in the entire performance through a hole in the folding-doors: this had been made but
a short time before, when the handle had been broken and jerked out, and I wished him joy of
his beating.  Giton, however, forgetting everything except his own compassion, thought we ought
to open the door and succor Eumolpus, in his peril; but being still angry, I could not restrain
my hand; clenching my fist, I rapped his pitying head with my sharp knuckles.  In tears, he
sat upon the bed, while I applied each eye in turn, to the opening, filling myself up as with
a dainty dish, with Eumolpus' misfortunes, and gloating over their prolongation, when Bargates,
agent for the building, called from his dinner, was carried into the midst of the brawl by
two chair-men, for he had the gout.  He carried on for some time against drunkards and fugitive
slaves, in a savage tone and with a barbarous accent, and then, looking around and catching
sight of Eumolpus, "What," he exclaimed, "are you here, nay prince of poets? and these damned
slaves don't scatter at once and stop their brawling!"  (Then, whispering in Eumolpus' ear,)
"My bedfellow's got an idea that she's finer-haired than I am; lampoon her in a poem, if you
think anything of me, and make 'er ashamed."

CHAPTER THE NINETY-SEVENTH.

Eumolpus was speaking privately with Bargates, when a crier attended by a public slave entered
the inn, accompanied by a medium-sized crowd of outsiders.  Waving a torch that gave out more
smoke than light, he announced: "Strayed from the baths, a short time ago, a boy about sixteen
years of age, curly headed, a minion, handsome, answers to the name of Giton.  One thousand
sesterces reward will be paid to anyone bringing him back or giving information as to his whereabouts."
Ascyltos, dressed in a tunic of many colors, stood not far from the crier, holding out a silver
tray upon which was piled the reward, as evidence of good faith. I ordered Giton to get under
the bed immediately, telling him to stick his hands and feet through the rope netting which
supported the mattress, and, just as Ulysses of old had clung to the ram, so he, stretched
out beneath the mattress, would evade the hands of the hunters.  And Giton did not hesitate
at obeying this order, but fastened his hands in the netting for a moment, outdoing Ulysses
in his own cunning!  For fear of leaving room for suspicion, I piled covers upon my pallet,
leaving the impression of a single person of my own stature.  Meanwhile Ascyltos, in company
with the magistrate's servant, had ransacked all the rooms and had come at last to mine, where
he entertained greater hopes of success, because he found the doors carefully barred.  The
public slave loosened the bolts by inserting the edge of his ax in the chink.  I threw myself
at Ascyltos' feet, begging him, by the memory of our friendship and our companionship in suffering,
to show me my "brother," safe and sound, and furthermore, that my simulated prayers might carry
conviction, I added, "I know very well, Ascyltos, that you have come here seeking  my  life.
If not,  why  the axes?

"Well, fatten your grudge, then!  Here's my neck!  Pour out that blood you seek to shed under
pretext of a search!"  Ascyltos repelled this suspicion, affirming that he sought nothing except
his own fugitive and desired the death of neither man nor suppliant, and least of all did he
wish to harm one whom, now that their quarrel was over, he regarded as his dearest friend.

CHAPTER THE NINETY-EIGHTH.

The public servant, however, was not derelict in the performance of his duty for, snatching
a cane from the innkeeper, he poked underneath the bed, ransacking every corner, even to the
cracks in the wall.  Twisting his body out of reach, and cautiously drawing a full breath,
Giton pressed his mouth against the very bugs themselves. (The pair had scarcely left the room)
when Eumolpus burst in in great excitement, for the doors had been broken and could keep no
one out. "The thousand sesterces are mine," he shouted, "I'll follow that crier out and tell
him Giton is in your power, and it will serve you right, too!"  Seeing that his mind was made
up, I embraced his knees and besought him not to kill a dying man.  "You might have some reason
for being excited," I said, "if you could produce the missing boy, but you cannot, as the thing
stands now, for he escaped into the crowd and I have not even a suspicion as to where he has
gone!  Get the lad back, Eumolpus, for heaven's sake, even if you do restore him to Ascyltos!"
I had just succeeded in persuading him to believe all this when Giton, nearly suffocated from
holding his breath, suddenly sneezed three times, and shook the bed.  Eumolpus turned at the
commotion.  "Hello, Giton," he exclaimed, "glad to see you!"  Then he turned back the mattress
and discovered an Ulysses who even a ravenous Cyclops might have spared; thereupon, he faced
me, "You robber," said he, "what does all this mean? You hadn't the nerve to tell me the truth
even when you were caught!  If the god, that umpires human affairs hadn't forced a sign from
this boy as he hung there, I would be wandering from one pot-house to another, like a fool!"
(But) Giton was far more tactful than I: first of all, he dressed the cut upon Eumolpus' forehead,
with spider's web soaked in oil; he then exchanged the poet's torn clothing for his own cloak;
this done, he embraced the old gentleman, who was already somewhat mollified, and poulticed
him with kisses.  "Dearest of fathers," he cried, "we are entirely in your hands!  In yours
alone!  If you love your Giton, do your best to save him.  Would that some cruel flame might
devour me, alone, or that the wintry sea might swallow me, for I am the cause for all these
crimes.  Two enemies would be reconciled if I should perish!"  (Moved by our troubles, but
particularly stirred by Giton's caresses, "You are fools," exclaimed Eumolpus, "you certainly
are: here you are gifted with talents enough to make your fortunes and you still lead a life
of misery, and every day you bring new torments upon yourselves, as the fruits of your own acts!)"
