Those who know little about cattle have written much of the meek and patient ox. Those who
know them well tell us that the ox is the "most cussedest of all cussed" animals; a sneak,
a bully, a coward, a thief, a shirk, a schemer; and when he is not in mischief he is thinking
about it. The wickedest pack mule that ever bucked his burden is a pinfeathered turtle-dove
compared with an average ox. Real Bassanio-- with sloping the pretence knows to thing, considering he

Alas! there he lay on the ground, his head sometimes raised, sometimes stretched out flat,
while the huge creature uttered short moans at times.

Only four years before, Rolf had seen that same thing at Redding. The rolling eye, the working
of the belly muscles, the straining and moaning. "It's colic; have you any ginger?"

"No, I hat only dot soft soap."

What soft soap had to do with ginger was not clear, and Rolf wondered if it had some rare occult

Any one who knows what slippery elm, peppermint, soda, sulphur, colic, and ox do when thoroughly

was all right again, very thirsty, and not quite up to his usual standard, but, as Van said,
after a careful look, "Ah, tell you vot, dot you vas a veil ox again, an' I t'ink I know not

Chapter 57. Rolf and Skookum at Albany

The Red Moon (August) follows the Thunder Moon, and in the early part of its second week Rolf
and Van, hauling in the barley and discussing the fitness of the oats, were startled by a most
outrageous clatter among the hens. Horrid murder evidently was stalking abroad, and, hastening
to the rescue, Rolf heard loud, angry barks; then a savage beast with a defunct "cackle party"
appeared, but dropped the victim to bark and bound upon the "relief party" with ecstatic expressions
of joy, in spite of Rolf's--"Skookum! you little brute!"

Yes! Quonab was back; that is, he was at the lake shore, and Skookum had made haste to plunge
into the joys and gayeties of this social centre, without awaiting the formalities of greeting
or even of dry-shod landing.

The next scene was--a big, high post, a long, strong chain and a small, sad dog.

"Ho, Quonab, you found your people? You had a good time?"

"Ugh," was the answer, the whole of it, and all the light Rolf got for many a day on the old
man's trip to the North. The prospect of going to Albany for Van Cortlandt was much more attractive
to Quonab than that of the harvest field, so a compromise was agreed on. Callan's barley was
in the stock; if all three helped Callan for three days, Callan would owe them for nine, and
so it was arranged.

Again "good-bye," and Rolf, Quonab, and little dog Skookum went sailing down the Schroon toward
the junction, where they left a cache of their supplies, and down the broadening Hudson toward
Albany.

Rolf had been over the road twice; Quonab never before, yet his nose for water was so good
and the sense of rapid and portage was so strong in the red man, that many times he was the
pilot. "This is the way, because it must be"; "there it is deep because so narrow"; "that rapid
is dangerous, because there is such a well-beaten portage trail"; "that we can run, because
I see it," or, "because there is no portage trail," etc. The eighty miles were covered in three
sleeps, and in the mid-moon days of the Red Moon they landed at the dock in front of Peter
Vandam's. If Quonab had any especial emotions for the occasion, he cloaked them perfectly under
a calm and copper-coloured exterior of absolute immobility.

When Rolf saw the pile of stuff that was gathered for that outfit, he stared at it aghast,
then looked at Vandam, and together they roared. There was everything for light housekeeping
and heavy doctoring, even chairs, a wash stand, a mirror, a mortar, and a pestle. Six canoes
could scarcely have carried the lot.

"'Tain't so much the young man as his mother," explained Big Pete; "at first I tried to make
'em understand, but it was no use; so I says, 'All right, go ahead, as long as there's room
in the warehouse.' I reckon I'll set on the fence and have some fun seein' Rolf ontangle the
affair."

"Phew, pheeeww--ph-e-e-e-e-w," was all Rolf could say in answer. But at last, "Wall, there's
always a way. I sized him up as pretty level headed. We'll see."

There was a way and it was easy, for, in a secret session, Rolf, Pete, and Van Cortlandt together
sorted out the things needed. A small tent, blankets, extra clothes, guns, ammunition, delicate
food for three months, a few medicines and toilet articles--a pretty good load for one canoe,
but a trifle compared with the mountain of stuff piled up on the floor. 

That which he signalize to Portia after it is not such an manful curling as he think, and he
doesn't intend to act any more, beckons to his retinue and goes off,
shed his cloak of his shoulder with a motion over amusing and not abnormal
annoyance.
