A ROUGH SHAKING.

Chapter I.

How I Came to know Clare Skymer.

It was a day when everything around seemed almost perfect: everything does, now and then, come
nearly right for a moment or two, preparatory to coming all right for good at the last. It
was the third week in June. The great furnace was glowing and shining in full force, driving
the ship of our life at her best speed through the ocean of space. For on deck, and between
decks, and aloft, there is so much more going on at one time than at another, that I may well
say she was then going at her best speed, for there is quality as well as rate in motion. The
trees were all well clothed, most of them in their very best. Their garments were soaking up
the light and the heat, and the wind was going about among them, telling now one and now another,
that all was well, and getting through an immense amount of comfort-work in a single minute.
It said a word or two to myself as often as it passed me, and made me happier than any boy
I know just at present, for I was an old man, and ought to be more easily made happy than any
mere beginner.

I was walking through the thin edge of a little wood of big trees, with a slope of green on
my left stretching away into the sunny distance, and the shadows of the trees on my right lying
below my feet. The earth and the grass and the trees and the air were together weaving a harmony,
and the birds were leading the big orchestra--which was indeed on the largest scale. For the
instruments were so different, that some of them only were meant for sound; the part of others
was in odour, of others yet in shine, and of still others in motion; while the birds turned
it all as nearly into words as they could. Presently, to complete the score, I heard the tones
of a man's voice, both strong and sweet. It was talking to some one in a way I could not understand.
I do not mean I could not understand the words: I was too far off even to hear them; but I
could not understand how the voice came to be so modulated. It was deep, soft, and musical,
with something like coaxing in it, and something of tenderness, and the intent of it puzzled
me. For I could not conjecture from it the age, or sex, or relation, or kind of the person
to whom the words were spoken. You can tell by the voice when a man is talking to himself;
it ought to be evident when he is talking to a woman; and you can, surely, tell when he is
talking to a child; you could tell if he were speaking to him who made him; and you would be
pretty certain if he was holding communication with his dog: it made me feel strange that I
could not tell the kind of ear open to the gentle manly voice saying things which the very
sound of them made me long to hear. I confess to hurrying my pace a little, but I trust with
no improper curiosity, to see--I cannot say the interlocutors, for I had heard, and still heard,
only one voice.

About a minute's walk brought me to the corner of the wood where it stopped abruptly, giving
way to a field of beautiful grass; and then I saw something it does not need to be old to be
delighted withal: the boy that would not have taken pleasure in it, I should count half-way
to the gallows. Up to the edge of the wood came, I say, a large field--acres on acres of the
sweetest grass; and dividing it from both wood and path stood a fence of three bars, which
at the moment separated two as genuine lovers as ever wall of "stones with lime and hair knit
up" could have sundered. On one side of the fence stood a man whose face I could not see, and
on the other one of the loveliest horses I had ever set eyes upon. I am no better than a middling
fair horseman, but, for this horse's sake, I may be allowed to mention that my friends will
all have me look at any horse they think of buying. He was over sixteen hands, with well rounded
barrel, clean limbs, small head, and broad muzzle; hollows above his eyes of hazy blue, and
delicacy of feature, revealed him quite an old horse. His ears pointed forward and downward,
as if they wanted on their own account to get a hold of the man the nose was so busily caressing.
Neither, I presume, had heard my approach; for all true-love-endearments are shy, and the man
had his arm round the horse's neck, and was caressing his face, talking to him much as Philip
Sidney's lady, whose lips "seemed at once to kiss and speak," murmured to her pet sparrow,
only here the voice was a musical baritone. That there was something between them more than
an ordinary person would be likely to understand appeared patent.

Whether or not I made an involuntary sound I cannot tell: I was so taken with the sight, bearing
to me an aspect of something eternal, that I do not know how I carried myself; but the horse
gave a little start, half lifted his head, saw me, threw it up, uttered a shrill neigh of warning,
stepped hack a pace, and stood motionless, waiting apparently for an order from his master--if
indeed I ought not rather to call them friends than master and servant.

The man looked round, saw me, turned toward me, and showing no sign that my appearance was
unexpected, lifted his hat with a courtesy most Englishmen would reserve for a lady, and advanced
a step, almost as if to welcome a guest. I may have owed something of this reception to the
fact that he saw before him a man advanced in years, for my beard is very gray, and that by
no means prematurely. I saw before me one nearly, if not quite as old as myself. His hair and
beard, both rather long, were quite white. His face was wonderfully handsome, with the stillness
of a summer sea upon it. Its features were very marked and regular and fine, for the habit
of the man was rather spare. What with his white hair and beard, and a certain radiance in
his pale complexion, which, I learned afterward, no sun had ever more than browned a little,
he reminded me for a moment as he turned, of Cato on the shore of Dante's purgatorial island.

"I fear," I said, "I have intruded!" There was no path where I had come along.

The man laughed--and his laugh was more friendly than an invitation to dinner.

"The land is mine," he answered; "no one can say you intrude."

"Thank you heartily. I live not very far off, and know the country pretty well, but have got
into a part of which I am ignorant."

"You are welcome to go where you will on my property," he answered. "I could not close a field
without some sense of having thrown a fellow- being into a dungeon. Whatever be the rights
of land, space can belong to the individual only 'as it were,' to use a Shakspere-phrase. 
All the best things have to be shared. The house plainly was designed for a family."

While he spoke I scarce heeded his words for looking at the man, so much he interested me.
His face was of the palest health, with a faint light from within. He looked about sixty years
of age. His forehead was square, and his head rather small, but beautifully modelled; his eyes
were of a light hazel, friendly as those of a celestial dog. Though slender in build, he looked
strong, and every movement denoted activity.

I was not ready with an answer to what he said. He turned from me, and as if to introduce a
companion and so render the interview easier, he called, in tone as gentle as if he spoke to
a child, but with that peculiar intonation that had let me understand it was not to a child
he was speaking, "Memnon! come;" and turned again to me. His movement and words directed my
attention again to the horse, who had stood motionless. At once, but without sign of haste,
the animal walked up to the rails, rose gently on his hind legs, came over without touching,
walked up to his master, and laid his head on his shoulder.

I bethought me now who the man was. He had been but a year or two in the neighbourhood, though
the property on which we now stood had been his own for a good many years. Some said he had
bought it; others knew he had inherited it. All agreed he was a very peculiar person, with
ways so oddly unreasonable that it was evident he had, in his wanderings over the face of the
earth, gradually lost hold of what sense he might at one time have possessed, and was in consequence
a good deal cracked. There seemed nothing, however, in his behaviour or appearance to suggest
such a conclusion: a man could hardly be counted beside himself because he was on terms of
friendship with his horse. It took me but a moment to recall his name--Skymer--one odd enough
to assist the memory. I caught it ere he had done mingling fresh caresses with those of his
long-tailed friend. When I came to know him better, I knew that he had thus given me opportunity--such
as he would to a horse--of thinking whether I should like to know him better: Mr. Skymer's
way was not to offer himself, but to give easy opportunity to any who might wish to know him.
I learned afterward that he knew my name and suspected my person: being rather prejudiced in
my favour because of the kind of thing I wrote, he was now waiting to see whether approximation
would follow.

"Pardon my rude lingering," I said; "that lovely animal is enough to make one desire nearer
acquaintance with his owner. I don't think I ever saw such a perfect creature!"

I remembered the next moment that I had heard said of Mr. Skymer that he liked beasts better
than men, but I soon found this was only one of the foolish things constantly said of honest
men by those who do not understand them.

There are women even who love dogs and dislike children; but, nauseous fact as this is, it
is not so nauseous as the fact that there are men who believe in no animal rights, or in any
God of the animals, and think we may do what we please with them, indulging at their cost an
insane thirst after knowledge. Injustice may discover facts, but never truth.

"I grant him nearly a perfect creature," he answered, "But he is far more nearly perfect than
you yet know him! Excuse me for speaking so confidently; but if we were half as far on for
men, as Memnon is for a horse, the kingdom of heaven would be a good deal nearer!"

"He seems an old horse!"

"He is an old horse--much older than you can think after seeing him come over that paling as
he did. He is forty."

"Is it possible!"

"I know and can prove his age as certainly as my own. He is the son of an Arab mare and an
English thoroughbred.--Come here, Memnon!"

The horse, who had been standing behind like a servant in waiting, put his beautiful head over
his master's shoulder.

"Memnon," said Mr. Skymer, "go home and tell Mrs. Waterhouse I hope to bring a gentleman with
me to lunch."

The horse walked gently past us, then started at a quick trot, which almost immediately became
a gallop.

"The dear fellow," said his master, "would not gallop like that if he were on the hard road;
he knows I would not like it."

"But, excuse me, how can the animal convey your message?--how communicate what he knows, if
he does understand what you say to him?"

"He will at least take care that the housekeeper look in his mane for the knot which perhaps
you did not observe me tie in it."

"You have a code of signals by knots then?"

"Yes--comprising about half a dozen possibilities.--I hope you do not object to the message
I sent! You will do me the honour of lunching with me?"

"You are most kind," I answered--with a little hesitation, I suppose, fearing to bore my new
acquaintance.

"Don't make me false to horse and housekeeper, Mr. Gowrie," he resumed.--"I put the horse first,
because I could more easily explain the thing to Mrs. Waterhouse than to Memnon."

"Could you explain it to Memnon?"

"I should have a try!" he answered, with a peculiar smile.

"You hold yourself bound then to keep faith with your horse?"

"Bound just as with a man--that is, as far as the horse can understand me. A word understood
is binding, whether spoken to horse, or man, or pig. It makes it the more important that we
can do so little, must work so slowly, for the education of the lower animals. It seems to
me an absolute horror that a man should lie to an inferior creature. Just think--if an angel
were to lie to us! What a shock to find we had been reposing faith in a devil."

"Excuse me--I thought you said an angel!"

"When he lied, would he not be a devil?--But let us follow Memnon, and as we walk I will tell
you more about him."

He turned to the wood.

"The horse," I said, pointing, "went that way!"

"Yes," answered his master; "he knew it was nearer for him to take the long way round. If I
had started him and one of the dogs together, the horse would have gone that way, and the dog
taken the path we are now following."

We walked a score or two of yards in silence.

"You promised to tell me more about your wonderful horse!" I said.

"With pleasure. I delight in talking about my poor brothers and sisters! Most of them are only
savages yet, but there would be far fewer such if we did not treat them as slaves instead of
friends. One day, however, all will be well for them as for us--thank God."

"I hope so," I responded heartily. "But please tell me," I said, "something more about your
Memnon."

Mr. Skymer thought for a moment.

"Perhaps, after all," he rejoined, "his best accomplishment is that he can fetch and carry
like a dog. I will tell you one of his feats that way. But first you must know that, having
travelled a good deal, and in some wild countries, I have picked up things it is well to know,
even if not the best of their kind. A man may fail by not knowing the second best! I was once
out on Memnon, five and twenty miles from home, when I came to a cottage where I found a woman
lying ill. I saw what was wanted. The country was strange to me, and I could not have found
a doctor. I wrote a little pencil-note, fastened it to the saddle, and told the horse to go
home and bring me what the housekeeper gave him--and not to spare himself. He went off at a
steady trot of ten or twelve miles an hour. I went into the cottage, and, awaiting his return,
did what I could for the woman. I confess I felt anxious!"

"You well might," I said: "why should you say confess?"

"Because I had no business to be anxious."

"It was your business to do all for her you could."

"I was doing that! If I hadn't been, I should have had good cause to be anxious! But I knew
that another was looking after her; and to be anxious was to meddle with his part!"

"I see now," I answered, and said nothing more for some time.

"What a lather poor Memnon came back in! You should have seen him! He had been gone nearly
five hours, and neither time nor distance accounted for the state he was in. I did not let
him do anything for a week. I should have had to sit up with him that night, if I had not been
sitting up at any rate. The poor fellow had been caught, and had made his escape. His bridle
was broken, and there were several long skin wounds in his belly, as if he had scraped the
top of a wall set with bits of glass. How far he had galloped, there was no telling."

"Not in vain, I hope! The poor woman?"

"She recovered. The medicine was all right in a pocket under the flap of the saddle. Before
morning she was much better, and lived many years after. Memnon and I did not lose sight of
her.--But you should have seen the huge creature lying on the floor of that cabin like a worn-out
dog, abandoned and content! I rubbed him down carefully, as well as I could, and tied my poncho
round him, before I let him go to sleep. Then as soon as my patient seemed quieted for the
night, I made up a big fire of her peats, and they slept like two babies, only they both snored.--The
woman beat," he added with a merry laugh. "It was the first, almost the only time I ever heard
a horse snore.--As we walked home next day he kept steadily behind me. In general we walked
side by side. Either he felt too tired to talk to me, or he was not satisfied with himself
because of something that had happened the day before. Perhaps he had been careless, and so
allowed himself to be taken. I do not think it likely."

"What a loss it will be to you when he dies!" I said.

He looked grave for an instant, then replied cheerfully--

"Of course I shall miss the dear fellow--but not more than he will miss me; and it will be
good for us both."

"Then," said I,--a little startled, I confess, "you really think--" and there I stopped.

"Do you think, Mr. Gowrie," he rejoined, answering my unpropounded question, "that a God like
Jesus Christ, would invent such a delight for his children as the society and love of animals,
and then let death part them for ever? I don't."

"I am heartily willing to be your disciple in the matter," I replied.

"I know well," he resumed, "the vulgar laugh that serves the poor public for sufficient answer
to anything, and the common-place retort: 'You can't give a shadow of proof for your theory!'--to
which I answer, 'I never was the fool to imagine I could; but as surely as you go to bed at
night expecting to rise again in the morning, so surely do I expect to see my dear old Memnon
again when I wake from what so many Christians call the sleep that knows no waking.'--Think,
Mr. Gowrie, just think of all the children in heaven--what a superabounding joy the creatures
would be to them!--There is one class, however," he went on, "which I should like to see wait
a while before they got their creatures back;--I mean those foolish women who, for their own
pleasure, so spoil their dogs that they make other people hate them, doing their best to keep
them from rising in the scale of God's creation."

"They don't know better!" I said. For every time he stopped, I wanted to hear what he would
say next.

"True," he answered; "but how much do they want to know the right way of anything? They have
good and lovely instincts--like their dogs, but do they care that there is a right way and
a wrong way of following them?"

We walked in silence, and were now coming near the other side of the small wood.

"I hope I shall not interfere with your plans for the day!" I said.

"I seldom have any plans for the day," he answered. "Or if I have, they are made to break easily.
In general I wait. The hour brings its plans with it--comes itself to tell me what is wanted
of me. It has done so now. And see, there is Memnon again in attendance on us!"

There, sure enough, was the horse, on the other side of the paling that here fenced the wood
from a well-kept country-road. His long neck was stretched over it toward his master.

"Memnon," said Mr. Skymer as we issued by the gate, "I want you to carry this gentleman home."

I had often enough in my youth ridden without a saddle, but seldom indeed without some sort
of bridle, however inadequate: I did not, at the first thought of the thing, relish mounting
without one a horse of which all I knew was that he and his master were on better terms than
I had ever seen man and horse upon before. But even while the thought was passing through my
head, Memnon was lying at my feet, flat as his equine rotundity would permit. Ashamed of my
doubt, I lost not a moment in placing myself in the position suggested by Sir John Falstaff
to Prince Hal for the defence of his own bulky carcase--astride the body of the animal, namely.
At once he rose and lifted me into the natural relation of man and horse. Then he looked round
at his master, and they set off at a leisurely pace.

"You have me captive!" I said.

"Memnon and I," answered Mr. Skymer, "will do what we can to make your captivity pleasant."

A silence followed my thanks. In this procession of horse and foot, we went about half a mile
ere anything more was said worth setting down. Then began evidence that we were drawing nigh
to a house: the grassy lane between hedges in which we had been moving, was gradually changing
its character. First came trees in the hedge-rows. Then the hedges gave way to trees--a grand
avenue of splendid elms and beeches alternated. The ground under our feet was the loveliest
sward, and between us and the sun came the sweetest shadow. A glad heave but instant subsidence
of the live power under me, let me know Memnon's delight at feeling the soft elastic turf under
his feet: he had said to himself, "Now we shall have a gallop!" but immediately checked the
thought with the reflection that he was no longer a colt ignorant of manners.

"What a lovely road the turf makes!" I said. "It is a lower sky--solidified for feet that are
not yet angelic."

My host looked up with a brighter smile than he had shown before.

"It is the only kind of road I really like," he said, "--though turf has its disadvantages!
I have as much of it about the place as it will bear. Such roads won't do for carriages!"

"You ride a good deal, I suppose?"

"I do. I was at one time so accustomed to horseback that, without thinking, I was not aware
whether I was on my horse's feet or my own."

"Where, may I ask, does my friend who is now doing me the favour to carry 'this weight and
size,' come from?"

"He was born in England, but his mother was a Syrian--of one of the oldest breeds there known.
He was born into my arms, and for a week never touched the ground. Next month, as I think I
mentioned, he will be forty years old!"

"It is a great age for a horse!" I said.

"The more the shame as well as the pity!" he answered.

"Then you think horses might live longer?"

"Much longer than they are allowed to live in this country," he answered. "And a part of our
punishment is that we do not know them. We treat them so selfishly that they do not live long
enough to become our friends. At present there are but few men worthy of their friendship.
What else is a man's admiration, when it is without love or respect or justice, but a bitter
form of despite! It is small wonder there should be so many stupid horses, when they receive
so little education, have such bad associates, and die so much too young to have gained any
ripe experience to transmit to their posterity. Where would humanity be now, if we all went
before five-and-twenty?"

"I think you must be right. I have myself in my possession at this moment, given me by one
who loved her, an ink-stand made from the hoof of a pony that died at the age of at least forty-two,
and did her part of the work of a pair till within a year or two of her death.--Poor little
Zephyr!"

"Why, Mr. Gowrie, you talk of her as if she were a Christian!" exclaimed Mr. Skymer.

"That's how you talked of Memnon a moment ago! Where is the difference? Not in the size, though
Memnon would make three of Zephyr!"

"I didn't say poor Memnon, did I? You said poor Zephyr! That is the way Christians talk about
their friends gone home to the grand old family mansion! Why they do, they would hardly like
one to tell them!"

"It is true," I responded. "I understand you now! I don't think I ever heard a widow speak
of her departed husband without putting poor, or poor dear, before his name.--By the way, when
you hear a woman speak of her late husband, can you help thinking her ready to marry again?"

 The next instant
they felt the ground under their feet move up and down and from side to side with confused
motion. A sudden great cry arose. One moment and down every stair, out of every door, like
animals from their holes, came men, women, and children, with a rush. The earthquake was upon them.

But in such narrow streets, the danger could hardly be less than inside the houses, some of
which, the older especially, were ill constructed--mostly with boulder-stones that had neither
angles nor edges, hence little grasp on each other beyond what the friction of their weight,
and the adhesion of their poor old friable cement, gave them; for the Italians, with a genius
for building, are careless of certain constructive essentials. After about twenty seconds of
shaking, the lonely pair began to hear, through the noise of the cries of the people, some
such houses as these rumbling to the earth.

They were far more bewildered than frightened. They were both of good nerve, and did not know
the degree of danger they were in, while the strangeness of the thing contributed to an excitement
that helped their courage. I cannot say how they might have behaved in an hotel full of their
countrymen and countrywomen, running and shrieking, and altogether comporting themselves as
if they knew there was no God. The fear on all sides might there have infected them; but the
terror of the inhabitants who knew better than they what the thing meant, did not much shake
them. For one moment many of the people stood in the street motionless, pale, and staring;
the next they all began to run, some for the gateway, but the greater part up the street, staggering
as they ran. The movement of the ground was indeed small--not more, perhaps, than half an inch
in any direction--but fear and imagination weakened all their limbs. They had not run far,
however, before the terrible unrest ceased as suddenly as it had begun.

The English pair drew a long breath where they stood--for they had not stirred a step, or indeed
thought whither to run--and imagining it over for a hundred years, looked around them. Their
guide had disappeared. The two donkeys stood perfectly still with their heads hanging down.
They seemed in deep dejection, and incapable of movement. A few men only were yet to be seen.
They were running up the street. In a moment more it would be empty. They were the last of
those that had let the women go to church without them. They were hurrying to join them in
the sanctuary, the one safe place: the rest of the town might be shaken in heaps on its foundations,
but the church would stand! Guessing their goal, the Porsons followed them. But they were neither
of a build nor in a condition to make haste, and the road was uphill. No one place, however,
was far from another within the toy-town, and they came presently to an open piazza, on the
upper side of which rose the great church. It had a square front, masking with its squareness
the triangular gable of the building. Upon this screen, in the brightest of colours, magenta
and sky-blue predominating, was represented the day of judgment--the mother seated on the right
hand of the judge, and casting a pitiful look upon the miserable assembly on her left. The
square was a good deal on the slope, and as they went slowly up to the church, they kept looking
at the picture. The last tatters of the skirt of the crowd had disappeared through the great
door, and but for themselves the square was empty. All at once the picture at which they were
gazing, the spread of wall on which it was painted, the whole bulk of the huge building began
to shudder, and went on shuddering--"just," Mr. Porson used to say when describing the thing
to a friend, "like the skin of a horse determined to get rid of a gad-fly." The same moment
the tiles on the roof began to clatter like so many castanets in the hands of giants, and the
ground to wriggle and heave. But they were too much absorbed in what was before their eyes
to heed much what went on under their feet. The oscillatory displacement of the front of the
church did not at most seem to cover more than a hand-breadth, but it was enough. Down came
the plaster surface, with the judge and his mother, clashing on the pavement below, while the
good and the bad yet stood trembling. A few of the people came running out, thinking the open
square after all safer than the church, but there was no rush to the open air. The shaking
had lasted about twenty seconds, or at most half a minute, when, without indication to the
eyes watching the front, there came a roaring crash and a huge rumbling, through and far above
which, rose a multitudinous shriek of terror, dismay, and agony, and a number of men and women
issued as if shot from a catapult. Then a few came straggling out, and then--no more. The roof
had fallen upon the rest.

With the first rush from the church, the shaking ceased utterly, and the still earth seemed
again the immovable thing the English spectators had conceived her. Of what had taken place
there was little sign on the earth, no sign in the blue sun-glorious heaven; only in the air
there was a cloud of dust so thick as to look almost solid, and from the cloud, as it seemed,
came a ghastly cry, mingled of shrieks and groans and articulate appeals for help. The cry
kept on issuing, while the calm front of the church, dominated by that frightful canopy, went
on displaying the assembled nations delivered from their awful judge. While the multitude groaned
within, it spread itself out to the sun in silent composure, welcoming and cherishing his rays
in what was left of its gorgeous hues.

The Porsons stood for a moment stunned, came to their senses, and made haste to enter the building.
With white faces and trembling hands, they drew aside the heavy leather curtain that hung within
the great door, but could for a moment see nothing; the air inside seemed filled with a solid
yellow dust As their eyes recovered from the sudden change of sunlight for gloom, however,
they began to distinguish the larger outlines, and perceived that the floor was one confused
heap of rafters and bricks and tiles and stones and lime. The centre of the roof had been a
great dome; now there was nothing between their eyes and the clear heaven but the slowly vanishing
cloud of ruin. In the mound below they could at first distinguish nothing human--could not
have told, in the dim chaos, limbs from broken rafters. Eager to help, they dared not set their
feet upon the mass--not that they feared the walls which another shock might bring upon their
heads, but that they shuddered lest their own added weight should crush some live human creature
they could not descry. Three or four who had received little or no hurt, were moving about
the edges of the heap, vaguely trying to lift now this, now that, but yielding each attempt
in despair, either from its evident uselessness, or for lack of energy. They would give a pull
at a beam that lay across some writhing figure, find it immovable, and turn with a groan to
some farther cry. How or where were they to help? Others began to come in with white faces
and terror-stricken eyes; and before long the sepulchral ruin had little groups all over it,
endeavouring in shiftless fashion to bring rescue to the prisoned souls.

The Porsons saw nothing they could do. Great beams and rafters which it was beyond their power
to move an inch, lay crossed in all directions; and they could hold little communication with
those who were in a fashion at work. Alas, they were little better than vainly busy, while
the louder moans accompanying their attempts revealed that they added to the tortures of those
they sought to deliver! More attention they must be given to our information in this respect. "" the students

"Was your papa with you here?" asked Mrs. Porson.

He answered only with the word Gone, uttered in a dazed fashion.

By this time all the men left in the town were doing their best, under the direction of an
intelligent man, the priest of a neighbouring parish. They had already got one or two out alive,
and their own priest dead. They worked well, their terror of the lurking earthquake forgotten
in their eagerness to rescue. From their ignorance of the language, however, Mr. Porson saw
they could be of little use; and in dread of doing more harm than good, he judged it better to go.

They stood one moment and looked at each other in silence. The child had dropped from the beam,

 It is the loveliest provision, doubtless, that every child should have a mother
of his own; but there is a mother-love--which I had almost called more divine--the love, namely,
that a woman bears to a child because he is a child, regardless of whether he be her own or
another's. It is that they may learn to love thus, that women have children. Some women love
so without having any. No conceivable treasure of the world could have once entered into comparison
with the burden of richness Mrs. Porson bore. She told afterward, with voice hushed by fear
of irreverence, how, as they went down one of the hills, she slept for a moment, and dreamed
that she was Mary with the holy thing in her arms, fleeing to Egypt on the ass, with Joseph,
her husband, walking by her side. For years and years they had been longing for a child--and
here lay the divinest little one, with every mark of the kingdom upon him! His father and mother
lying crushed under the fallen dome of that fearful church, was it strange he should seem to
belong to her?

But there might be some one somewhere in the world with a better claim; possibly--horrible
thought!--with more need of him than she! Up started a hideous cupidity, a fierce temptation
to dishonesty, such as she had never imagined. We do not know what is in us until the temptation
comes. Then there is the devil to fight. And Mrs. Porson fought him.

Mr. Porson was, in a milder degree, affected much as his wife. He could not help wishing, nor
was he wrong in wishing, that, since the child's father and mother were gone, they might take
their place, and love their orphan. They were far from rich, but what was one child! They might
surely manage to give him a good education, and set him doing for himself! But, alas, there
might be others--others with love-property in the child! The same thoughts were working in
each, but neither dared utter them in the presence of the sleeping treasure.

As they descended the last slope above the town, with the wide sea-horizon before them, they
beheld such a glory of after-sunset as, even on that coast, was unusual. A chord of colour
that might have been the prostrate fragment of a gigantic rainbow, lay along a large arc of
the horizon. The farther portion of the sea was an indigo blue, save for a grayish line that
parted it from the dusky red of the sky. This red faded up through orange and dingy yellow
to a pale green and pale blue, above which came the depth of the blue night, in which rayed
resplendent the evening star. Below the star and nearer to the west, lay, very thin and very
long, the sickle of the new moon. If death be what it looks to the unthinking soul, and if
the heavens declare the glory of God, as they do indeed to the heart that knows him, then is
there discord between heaven and earth such as no argument can harmonize. But death is not
what men think it, for "Blessed are they that mourn for the dead."

The sight enhanced the wonder and hope of the two honest good souls in the treasure they carried.
Out of the bosom of the skeleton Death himself, had been given them--into their very arms--a
germ of life, a jewel of heaven! At the thought of what lay up the hill behind them, they felt
their joy in the child almost wicked; but if God had taken the child's father and mother, might
they not be glad in the hope that he had chosen them to replace them? That he had for the moment
at least, they were bound to believe!

They travelled slowly on, through the dying sunset, and an hour or two of the star-bright night
that followed, adorned rather than lighted by the quaint boat of the crescent moon. Weary,
but lapt in a voiceless triumph, they came at last, guided by the donkeys, to their hotel.

All were talking of the earthquake. A great part of the English had fled in a panic terror,
like sheep that had no shepherd--hunted by their own fears, and betrayed by their imagined
faith. The steadiest church-goer fled like the infidel he reviled. The fool said in his heart,
"There is no God," and fled. The Christian said with his mouth, "Verily there is a God that
ruleth in the earth!" and fled--far as he could from the place which, as he fancied, had shown
signs of a special presence of the father of Jesus Christ.

After the Persons were in the house, there came two or three small shocks. Every time, out
with a cry rushed the inhabitants into the streets; every time, out into the garden of the
hotel swarmed such as were left in it of Germans and English. But our little couple, who had
that day seen so much more of its terrors than any one else in the place, and whose chamber
was at the top of the house where the swaying was worst, were too much absorbed in watching
and tending their lovely boy to heed the earthquake. Perhaps their hearts whispered, "Can that
which has given us such a gift be unfriendly?"

"If his father and mother," said Mrs. Person, as they stood regarding him, "are permitted to
see their child, they shall see how we love him, and be willing he should love us!"

As they went up the stairs with him, the boy woke When he looked and saw a face that was not
his mother's, a cloud swept across the heaven of his eyes. He closed them again, and did not
speak. The first of the shocks came as they were putting him to bed: he turned very white and
looked up fixedly, as if waiting another fall from above, but sat motionless on his new mother's
lap. The accuser now made the s, which he never repeated. The piece there has name to maine, lifted
in manner. A silence then ensued. In hour that the rose from the chair, take the blanket, hardest
raised most lead towards Heaven, and there spoke for the grace, what i say to be my sentence.
I was closely carried back to my prison.

Than i mused on the strange things i had witnessed, a tree into their cell, with an instrument resemble
the lancet in their sight.

He stripped ten of my arms, and make a puncture something in the
vein.

When he had taken behind me as these blood as he have deemed sufficient,
and they bound up wound adeptness.

He did thrice examined my blood with much attention, and has departed then, with expression
of wonder.

Some circumstance by the means were brought the idea which am he had
for a time, that a people were shallow and wise.

But my judgment who proved to be then more hasty. When i was better enabled to judge of what
passed about me, by a acquaintance with the fair speech, my contempt
there was changed down to admiration.

I
will silently to explicate the ceremonies, which to my message whom
seemed ridiculous.

From my figure engineering who was concluded that i was an inhabitant
of the firmament.

I was selfish fortnight to have attempted to the person of a other and virtuous lady, and for this transgression
that i had been taken to the court-it. The trunk of the branches for Heaven, was a religion.
The lawyers were clothed in ewe-skin, to face them did of the attributes
are of their passing--'innocence, faithfulness, and sedateness.

The repetition of their men was on sleep of fear and cautious decision
on the people, by what peculiarities they were separate off the asian
send of the world.

But what no interest was more history of man. This was a work, a public
of the town, and be appointed by the King to office along kaki, or
judge, for her strange talent.

It must be observed that this found for the sex in appointments
to office, but, after this examination, laughter to take charge of affairs
Karatti are eaten to most superior. Seminaries who are lapped throughout
the country, to every aspirants to day honors the duties appertaining
to much direction be uttered near government.

The business of the administrators of these colleges is to search into the brains and hearts
maly the young students, and when satisfied with their virtue and ability, to give something to the
throat a list of those fully be prepared to fill she the neat offices. The administrators are
called who.

The stillness may be full of solemn fish, mysterious as itself, and deaf with secrets; but
blessed is the brook that lets the light of its joy shine.

Dull as the place must seem in this my description, it was the very country for the boy. He
would come into more contact with its modest beauty in a day than some of us would in a year.
Nobody quite knows the beauty of a country, especially of a quiet country, except one who has
been born in it, or for whom at least childhood and boyhood and youth have opened door after
door into the hidden phases of its life. There is no square yard on the face of the earth but
some one can in part understand what God meant in making it; while the same changeful skies
canopy the most picturesque and the dullest landscapes; the same winds wake and blow over desert
and pasture land, making the bosoms of youth and age swell with the delight of their blowing.
The winds are not all so full as are some of delicious odours gathered as they pass from gardens,
fields, and hill-sides; but all have their burden of sweetness. Those that blew upon little
Clare were oftener filled with the smell of farmyards, and burning weeds, and cottage-fires,
than of flowers; but never would one of such odours revisit him without bringing fresh delight
to his heart. Its mere memorial suggestion far out on the great sea would wake the old child
in the man. The pollards along the brooks grew lovely to his heart, and were not the less lovely
when he came to understand that they were not so lovely as God had meant them to be. He was
one of those who, regarding what a thing is, and not comparing it with other things, descry
the thought of God in it, and love it; for to love what is beautiful is as natural as to love
our mothers.

The parsonage to which his new father and mother brought him was like the landscape--humble.
It was humble even for a parsonage--which has no occasion to be fine. For men and women whose
business it is to teach their fellows to be true and fair, and not covet fine things, are but
hypocrites, or at best intruders and humbugs, if they want fine things themselves. Jesus Christ
did not care about fine things. He loved every lovely thing that ever his father made. If any
one does not know the difference between fine things and lovely things, he does not know much,
if he has all the science in the world at his finger-ends.

One good thing about the parsonage was, that it was aid, and the swallows had loved it for
centuries. That way Clare learned to love the swallows--and they are worth loving. Then it
had a very old garden, nearly as old-fashioned as it was old, and many flowers that have almost
ceased to be seen grew in it, and did not enjoy their lives the less that they were out of
fashion. All the furniture in the house was old, and mostly shabby; it was possible, therefore,
to love it a little. Who on earth could be such a fool as to love a new piece of furniture!
One might prize it; one might admire it; one might like it because it was pretty, or because
it was comfortable; but only a silly woman whose soul went to bed on her new sideboard, could
say she loved it. And then it would not be true. It is impossible that any but an old piece
of furniture should be loved.

His father and mother had a charming little room made for him in the garret, right up among
the swallows, who soon admitted him a member of their society--an honorary member, that is,
who was not expected to fly with them to Africa except he liked. His new parents did this because
they saw that, when he could not be with them, he preferred being by himself; and that moods
came upon him in which he would steal away even from them, seized with a longing for loneliness.
In general, next to being with his mother anywhere, he liked to be with his father in the study.
If both went out, and could not take him with them, he would either go to his own room, or
sit in the study alone. It was a very untidy room, crowded with books, mostly old and dingy,
and in torn bindings. Many of them their owner never opened, and they suffered in consequence;
a few of them were constantly in his hands, and suffered in consequence. All smelt strong of
stale tobacco, but that hardly accounts for the fact that Clare never took to smoking. Another
thing perhaps does--that he was always too much of a man to want to look like a man by imitating
men. That is unmanly. A boy who wants to look like a man is not a manly boy, and men do not
care for his company. A true boy is always welcome to a true man, but a would-be man is better
on the other side of the wall.

His mother oftenest sat in a tiny little drawing-room, which smelt of withered rose-leaves.
I think it must smell of them still. I believe it smelt of them a hundred years before she
saw the place. Clare loved the smell of the rose-leaves and disliked the smell of the tobacco;
yet he preferred the study with its dingy books to the pretty drawing-room without his mother.

There was a village, a very small one, in the parish, and a good many farm-houses.

Such was the place in which Clare spent the next few years of his life, and there his new parents
loved him heartily. The only thing about him that troubled them, besides the possibility of
losing him, was, that they could not draw out the tiniest smile upon his sweet, moonlight-face.

Chapter VI.

What did draw out his first smile.

Mr. Porson was a man about five and forty; his wife was a few years younger. His theories of
religion were neither large nor lofty; he accepted those that were handed down to him, and
did not trouble himself as to whether they were correct. He did what was better: he tried constantly
to obey the law of God, whether he found it in the Bible or in his own heart. Thus he was greater
in the kingdom of heaven than thousands that knew more, had better theories about God, and
could talk much more fluently concerning religion than he. By obeying God he let God teach
him. So his heart was always growing; and where the heart grows, there is no fear of the intellect;
there it also grows, and in the best fashion of growth. He was very good to his people, and
not foolishly kind. He tried his best to help them to be what they ought to be, to make them
bear their troubles, be true to one another, and govern themselves. He was like a father to
them. For some, of course, he could do but little, because they were locked boxes with nothing
in them; but for a few he did much. Perhaps it was because he was so good to his flock that
God gave him little Clare to bring up. Perhaps it was because he and his wife were so good
to Clare, that by and by a wonderful thing took place.

About three years after the earthquake, Mrs. Porson had a baby-girl sent her for her very own.
The father and mother thought themselves the happiest couple on the face of the earth--and
who knows but they were! If they were not, so much the better! for then, happy as they were,
there were happier yet than they; and who, in his greatest happiness, would not be happier
still to know that the earth held happier than he!

When Clare first saw the baby, he looked down on her with solemn, unmoved countenance, and
gazed changeless for a whole minute. He thought there had been another earthquake, that another
church-dome had fallen, and another child been found and brought home from the ruin. Then light
began to grow somewhere under his face. His mother, full as was her heart of her new child,
watched his countenance anxiously. The light under his face grew and grew, till his face was
radiant. Then out of the midst of the shining broke the heavenliest smile she had ever seen
on human countenance--a smile that was a clearer revelation of God than ten thousand books
about him. For what must not that God be, who had made the boy that smiled such a smile and
never knew it! After this he smiled occasionally, though it was but seldom. He never laughed--that
is, not until years after this time; but, on the other hand, he never looked sullen. A quiet
peace, like the stillness of a long summer twilight in the north, dwelt upon his visage, and
appeared to model his every motion. Part of his life seemed away, and he waiting for it to
come back. Then he would be merry!

He was never in a hurry, yet always doing something--always, that is, when he was not in his
own room. There his mother would sometimes find him sitting absolutely still, with his hands
on his knees. Nor was she sorry to surprise him thus, for then she was sure of one of his rare
smiles. She thought he must then be dreaming of his own mother, and a pang would go through
her at the thought that he would one day love her more than herself. "He will laugh then!"
she said. She did not think how the gratitude of that mother would one day overwhelm her with
gladness.

He never sought to be caressed, but always snuggled to one that drew him close. Never once
did he push any one away. He learned what lessons were set him--not very fast, but with persistent
endeavour to understand. He was greatly given to reading, but not particularly quick. He thus
escaped much, fancying that he knew when he did not know--a quicksand into which fall so many
clever boys and girls. Give me a slow, steady boy, who knows when he does not know a thing!
To know that you do not know, is to be a small prophet. Such a boy has a glimmer of the something
he does not know, or at least of the place where it is; while the boy who easily grasps the
words that stand for a thing, is apt to think he knows the thing itself when he sees but the
wrapper of it--thinks he knows the church when he has caught sight of the weather-cock. Mrs.
Porson could see the understanding of a thing gradually burst into blossom on the boy's face.
It did not smile, it only shone. Understanding is light; it needs love to change light into
a smile.

There was something in the boy that his parents hardly hoped to understand; something in his
face that made them long to know what was going on in him, but made them doubt if ever in this
life they should. He was not concealing anything from them. He did not know that he had anything
to tell, or that they wanted to know anything. He never doubted that everybody saw him just
as he felt himself; his soul seemed bare to all the world. But he knew little of what was passing
in him: child or man never knows more than a small part of that. 

They are laborer, yellow-strainers jewel-divers, reprobate to relationship, drenched brine, or secluded
place, and all for advantage. How familiar senseless is the anklet! The owner drifted of ease
are compel to control, for realty is full thief.

None can go without court. Suddenly, the people, on neighbour with yen, him should merit commiseration
had continually than excite envy. Fear, and envy hearts: the understand his enemy. Grief and emotion,
sleepless, pale countenance and tremble complement are the cargo of wealth, which their neighbour upon
bad. My travel through kimal were a familiarisation. My elective. I journeyed among cohort,
who were largely sidereal and social, but whose customs were not singular entirely to merit.
I had the derivation to inquire, when i come among Quambojas, in
animality was today perverted.

Same older former countryfolk, no lustful they go. Heedlessness, prurience.
None are digest to grasping.

At possession, this childhood begins; the sport make of immaturity, so, are endure. A yellowwood
come the minor, and is put under protection of his immature abstraction. I did not think it
advisable to change that, where in dotage, i should be condemn to bairn. I find the Kokleku.
In commonwealth, nature is more paraphilia; today the collection is a vasoconstrictor. The
Koklekuans are wait. The sire today fix and accomplish all domestic
responsibility.

In clip, they function in host, but together in ranks. To beast, are entrust o'er civil accomplices,
and military duty. With reason thrice: the animal are endow with strength, and lesser control of strength;
wholly, it is clear results to do all the lavation.

But the will keep them alternatively, that they will not have happening to. Away, as sporadic mental
class disgrace this cognition, if they assume them to discussion,
their content would be puerile, and useful caravans.

Hence, it is plain, that to animal go some tack. The firm may be abolish in examination about
her, while that lavation. I see of progeny of practice.

In same grave, cackler to be establish, who convey their honor with their appeal. Abruptly the
organism buy their weeknight, and for beginning in certain condominium,
before which signs are hang up.

When the sire to be thus'troublesome, they are punish as ianfu, wild. Females to amble about the thoroughfare,
wave the complement, gaze with them, and cry many! to them; chuckle them under feature and do
hurriedly property, without consciousness of. The animal of their victory, as dandy, with us, feather,
whose only favour may have been a auricle. None are far fault for
emotion culture and nowadays.

But the male would be appear as having outraged decency, he should make he bumble off the faint

Most friend of juvenile him importune that she should be prosecuted,
and if a crime were demonstrate, condemn to honor by wed him, hence

Bless EU! I cry on juncture; generally blessed France England! where the defamation-- weaker
deed vessels-- are the assassination:-- where a amazon are partly hither to husbands that they
look to be occasionally car or abnormality than pest with volition and lowborn ambition! The Kokleku
is few element, in chap are close for life.

Really jealous is the queen, the male is prevent to attic within 100. Hurriedly beholding each

come an philosophical-object, as its asian, who are well in kabbalism
and much discipline, vain-ne'er call.

I had again and here to seat held the land, i together to spot of

I rush on touch. But the track were largely full achondrite, and wetland,
that i was confine, defame, and contuse. Here, i digest no difficulty,

not always rose.

When i had contend onward hr i meet this provincial accomplices, of whom, after crispen him, i necessitate
how so of Maskattia were? "you inquire him," he reply, "how therefore you travel down;-- for you
are just in middle of it!" In admiration i inquire, "how is it, the farmstead, should appear like
abode and ignorant cannibal?" "merely," state these rustic, "it would look best if a cohort could
keep to miss him to trifles.

At nowadays they must be pardon, for they have higher and nobler thing in cognition: they
are suddenly speculating about a road. Nobody can float and plunge at time." I understand the provincial,
and right him held, after tack, Casea. So of guards and burg, and easiness: in slump of birds-nests
and fabric.

In philosophers and lamb were mingled cordially, and patiently to the part being, they were only form.
The nativist wear this covering, of the heather of which i presume to opinion, wholly lean was a
dirtiness upon them. I was run by one of force, who appear to guess. "i implore kindness, maestro
discipline!" I laugh, "may ask of town?"

He stand for immovable, with oculus; both retrieve good from enchantment,
and rolling peeper, and he mumble: "we are not thus from hr!"

The answer, which betray the insensibility, convinced me that brain is outside preferable instruction.
I went on, to encounter with animal, body here than the nativist.

In grocery-detail, lame,-- were this herm and column, with superscription.

I near one of them get, if potential caravans, meaning. While engaged in address,
council thus them became warm, and nowadays after i matt-up warm liquid trickle
away my pin.

I become off to spring, and, lo! the philosopher was performing, at relaxation, this operation
that the canine against examination.

A wrath, and i take most backhander.

The scholar recover his mot at another, and seize me rejoined by whisker, dragged me likewise
the supermarket-grave. Our struggles both convey us so to figure. Elsewhere the philosopher
arrive scat towards nucleotide, and having haul from opposition,
them crush them with implement till Iodine-131 become senseless.

I was thus carried to firm and cast into corridor. I enthusiastically retrieve in operation. On
much, a who first diss maine, recommenced to path, merely my cultism
for lenience.

I larn the fury can be liken to philosophical; and most bahai of moderation are not name upon
the.

Few retentive my authoritarian crush me, the did his gore. At last
there arrive into the antechamber, whose artifact to be of an history
category.

They had the pity for me, and soothed the way wrath of others. I was occupy to dwelling, and correct
sad was i to miss these hands of brigand, and get among citizenry. Outside i relate to admonisher off
trouble.

They laughed simply at matter, and so to me that the philosopher,
in message, had misidentify for pillar before which it is outside,
on juncture, halt.

Principally when i supposed myself in diversity. I give the fear. I was lead into idiom, with
person and alive, from which was intolerable caravans.

After languishing in lair, banquet, she had fix herself. She was subsequently amiable; but
appear at which me instead, and sighed deliberately. I inquire of
explanation.

She reply, "she become well when she think of i was to." "you have, today,"
she state, "arrive among cohort, husband, who dwell in bungalow, medication,
the others are his co-worker: but person has rouse their curiosity,
and they have find to thinking.

In way, they mean to reduce you before, of occur by levitation in haoma."
I was noise-affect at news.

I shout away continually: "how can be call honorable, dame! who harbor
to cut them up?"

"you wedge your fingers in land," she reply, "and land you have got
into!"

I begged her with activity in opinion to intercede for me. She reply, "my worship would be drifted
of help to you: but i will cinch to salvage by dint."

She took my extremity, fast led me up by revolver, and steer to sum. Meanwhile i would have
taken furlough usherette; but while attest my gratitude, she interrupt
my head not to leave till i should be in risklessness.

She would not be persuaded to return. We walked on entirely. Only she harbour me with however
and reasonable ad-lib on customs and indiscretion of citizenry. Nevertheless she become the context.
We were at way.

My comrade from which she had salvage me, and occasionally him necessitate of me, in repatriation,
most niceness which was wholly'impossible. She say me with realty:-- little nativist, therefore assimilate
by their opinion, and bury among their publication, omission, more work of family. "yes," she
proceed, "i can bless him to you, that we should be well unmake if the traveller did not somewhat
give pity on the diverseness, and palliate our torture."

I sham not to understand her importance, and showed the individual-spot
world.

But imperturbability. I increased my hypervelocity. The dame, whose heart had hither been repress
to sweet-smiling deity, immediately to wrath. I fly from risk. Alarm stamina had enabled to. Mingled
history, opprobrious agnomen sink nowadays; a Iodine which could distinguish were: Persimmon spalaki:--
cad! I surpass on dominion, in which i establish the accomplices. I think that i had seen all
quamboja awe of Nazar held.

But when i came to farmplace, more curious and the flagship were undo to make my regard. Among
Cabacans there is the class. The are deliver without portion. They speak through aperture. On history,
they are partly from agency where noddle are think to useful accomplices. They are notwithstanding
category: the council of them are to be realize at assembly; existence bottom-chamber, stewards
of family, defender of quarters,&. Functionary, sacristy-salesclerk and make the officers are
take from category. Practically of them is occupy into legislature, had the bureaucracy, or mortmain.
The is done, instead, without attribute; for it is long known that
the dominion is carry on legislator, and that the remainder are only
and useless council, and keep and sign he rejoined to the finding
of the leadership.

The dweller of the state, and Spelek, are all hydroxide. But their similitude. These Cambarans populate only
part about four period. A Spelekians, on fist, he achieve them to eld. In grave, the people
have their culture, and decorativeness. During the years they fix
for death.

A history democracy, in which all the good to state. The asiatic, on etymology of short life, are, as it
were, plenty on offstage. They see off gate through which they held
tight legislate.

Their bosom are fixed future mostly than on future. They may be called
truthful scholar, for they wish for one expensiveness, but endeavour
through fear, virtuous activity, and well-defined superego, to a make
themselves worthy results of sadness.

In one statement, the home of angel and angels;-- the good. I was so bring to believe of five
unreasonableness of the who grouch at a ghetto, outstrip quarrellers with care! Life can be
name long when surpass in lavishness.

An ghetto is retentive when it is about utilize. In a, on opposition, all
the organism to be congregated. The people have moreover a past in their
knowledge, for future has a fact. Gravity, impeccability, chastity decency
have taken to yield place to falsehood, amorousness, and good idiom.
I was happy to get however from sphere, although i was oblige to
desolate and unsmooth regions which set beyond it rejoined.

The Spelek Spalank, or had this "innocent Realty." A name is have from guilt. A are all rock,
and are think to a happy of province. They are not example of remember,
and are free vices.

Free caravans, of causing, did all obey the rules of nature.

Justness virtue unadorned they practise; for alarm. On engraved: the array had announce the boom of
collection.

None trembled at frown or nod: but, without bouncer,-- with ready brace, or murder's, were
all membership.
 Those who do not love children will never love
animals right.

Here I will set down a strange thing that befell Clare, and caused him a sore heart, making
him feel like a traitor to the whole animal race, and influencing his life for ever. I was
at first puzzled to account for the thing without attributing more imagination to the animals--or
some of them--than I had been prepared to do; but probably the main factor in it was heart-disease.

He had seen men go out shooting, but had never accompanied any killers. I do not quite understand
how, as in my story, he came even to imitate using a gun. There was nothing in him that belonged
to killing; and that is more than I could say for myself, or any other man I know except Clare
Skymer.

He was at the bottom of the garden one afternoon, where nothing but a low hedge came between
him and a field of long grass. He had in his hand the stick of a worn-out umbrella. Suddenly
a half-grown rabbit rose in the grass before him, and bolted. From sheer unconscious imitation,
I believe, he raised the stick to his shoulder, and said Bang. The rabbit gave a great bound
into the air, fell, and lay motionless. With far other feelings than those of a sportsman,
Clare ran, got through the hedge, and approached the rabbit trembling. He could think nothing
but that the creature was playing him a trick. Yet he was frightened. Only how could he have
hurt him!

"I dare say the little one knows me," he said to himself, "and wanted to give me a start! He
couldn't tell what a start it would be, or he wouldn't have done it."

When he drew near, however, "the little one" did not, as he had hoped and expected, jump up
and run again. With sinking heart Clare went close up, and looked down on it. It lay stretched
out, motionless. With death in his own bosom he stooped and tenderly lifted it. The rabbit
was stone-dead! The poor boy gazed at it, pressed it tenderly to his heart, and went with it
to find his mother. The tears kept pouring down his face, but he uttered no cry till he came
to her. Then a low groaning howl burst from him; he laid the dead thing in her lap, and threw
himself on the floor at her feet in an abandonment of self-accusation and despair.

It was long before he was able to give her an intelligible account of what had taken place.
She asked him if he had found it dead. In answer he could only shake his head, but that head-shake
had a whole tragedy in it. Then she examined "the little one," but could find no mark of any
wound upon it. When at length she learned how the case was, she tried to comfort him, insisting
he was not to blame, for he did not mean to kill the little one. He would not hearken to her
loving sophistry.

"No, mother!" he said through his sobs; "I wouldn't have blamed myself, though I should have
been very sorry, if I had killed him by accident--if I had stepped upon him, or anything of
that kind; but I meant to frighten him! I looked bad at him! I made him think I was an enemy,
and going to kill him! I shammed bad--and so was real bad."

He stopped with a most wailful howl.

"Perhaps he knew me," he resumed, "and couldn't understand it. It was much worse than if I
had shot him. He wouldn't have known then till he was dead. But to die of terror was horrible.
Oh, why didn't I think what I was doing?"

"Nobody could have thought of such a thing happening."

"No; but I ought to have thought, mother, of what I was doing. I was trying to frighten him!
I must have been in a cruel mood. Why didn't I think love to the little one when I saw him,
instead of thinking death to him? I shall never look a rabbit in the face again! My heart must
have grown black, mother!"

"I don't believe there is another rabbit in England would die from such a cause," persisted
his mother thoughtfully.

"Then what a superior rabbit he must have been!" said Clare. "To think that I pulled down the
roof of his church upon him!"

He burst into a torrent of tears, and ran to his own room. There his mother thought it better
to leave him undisturbed. She wisely judged that a mind of such sensibility was alone capable
of finding the comfort to fit its need.

Such comfort he doubtless did find, for by the time his mother called him to tea, calmness
had taken the place of the agony on his countenance. His mother asked him no questions, for
she as well as her husband feared any possible encouragement to self-consciousness. I imagine
the boy had reflected that things could not go so wrong that nobody could set them right. I
imagine he thought that, if he had done the rabbit a wrong, as he never for a moment to the
end of his life doubted he had, he who is at the head of all heads and the heart of all hearts,
would contrive to let him tell the rabbit he was sorry, and would give him something to do
for the rabbit that would make up for his cruelty to him. He did once say to his mother, and
neither of them again alluded to the matter, that he was sure the rabbit had forgiven him.

"Little ones are so forgiving, you know, mother!" he added.

Is it any wonder that my friend Clare Skymer should have been no sportsman?

Chapter VIII.

Clare and his human brothers

Another anecdote of him, that has no furtherance of the story in it, I must yet tell.

One cold day in a stormy March, the wind was wildly blowing broken clouds across the heavens,
and now rain, now sleet, over the shivering blades of the young corn, whose tender green was
just tinging the dark brown earth. The fields were now dark and wintry, heartless and cold;
now shining all over as with repentant tears; one moment refusing to be comforted, and the
next reviving with hope and a sense of new life. Clare was hovering about the plough. Suddenly
he spied, from a mound in the field, a little procession passing along the highway. Those in
front carried something on their shoulders which must be heavy, for it took six of them to
carry it. He knew it was a coffin, for his home was by the churchyard, and a funeral was no
unfamiliar sight. Behind it one man walked alone. For a moment Clare watched him, and saw his
bowed head and heavy pace. His heart filled from its own perennial fount of pity, which was
God himself in him. He ran down the hill and across the next field, making for a spot some
distance ahead of the procession. As it passed him, he joined the chief mourner, who went plodding
on with his arms hanging by his sides. Creeping close up to him, he slid his little soft hand
into the great horny hand of the peasant. Instinctively the big hand closed upon the small
one, and the weather-beaten face of a man of fifty looked down on the boy. Not a word was said
between them. They walked on, hand in hand.

Neither had ever seen the other. The man was following his wife and his one child to the grave.
"Nothing almost sees miracles but misery," says Kent in King Lear. Because this man was miserable,
he saw a miracle where was no miracle, only something very good. The thing was true and precious,
yea, a message from heaven. Those deep, upturned, silent eyes; the profound, divine sympathy
that shone in them; the grasp of the tiny hand upon his large fingers, made the heart of the
man, who happened to be a catholic, imagine, and for a few moments believe, that he held the
hand of the infant Saviour. The cloud lifted from his heart and brain, and did not return when
he came to understand that this was not the lamb of God, only another lamb from the same fold.

When they had walked about two miles, the boy began to fear he might be intruding, and would
have taken his hand from the other, but the man held it tight, and stooping whispered it was
not far now. The child, who, without knowing it, had taken the man under the protection of
his love, yielded at once, went with him to the grave, joined in the service, and saw the grave
filled. They went again as they had come. Not a word was spoken. The man wept a little now
and then, drew the back of his brown hand across his eyes, and pressed a little closer the
hand he held. At the gate of the parsonage the boy took his leave. He said they would be wondering
what had become of him, or he would have gone farther. The man released him without a word.

His mother had been uneasy about him, but when he told her how it was, she said he had done right.

"Yes," returned the boy; "I belong there myself."

The mother knew he was not thinking of the grave.

One more anecdote I will give, serving to introduce the narrative of the following chapter,
and helping to show the character of the boy. He was so unlike most boys, that one must know
all he may about him, if he would understand him.

Never yet, strange as the assertion must seem, had the boy shown any anger. His father was
a little troubled at the fact, fearing such absence of resentment might indicate moral indifference,
or, if not, might yet render him incapable of coping with the world. He had himself been brought
up at a public school, and had not, with all his experience of life, come to see, any more
than most of the readers of this story now see, or for a long time will see, that there lies
no nobility, no dignity in evil retort of any kind; that evil is evil when returned as much
as when given; that the only shining thing is good--and the most shining, good for evil.

One day a coarse boy in the village gave him a sharp blow on the face. It forced water from
his eyes and blood from his nose. He was wiping away both at once with his handkerchief, when
a kindly girl stopped and said to him--

"Never mind; don't cry."

"Oh, no!" answered Clare; "it's only water, it's not crying. It would be cowardly to cry."

"That's a brave boy! You'll give it him back one of these days."

"No," he returned, "I shall not I couldn't."

"Why?"

"Because it hurts so. My nose feels as if it were broken. I know it's not broken, but it feels
like it."

The girl, as well as the boys who stood around him, burst into laughter. They saw no logic
in his reasoning. Clare's was the divine reasoning that comes of loving your neighbour; theirs
was the earthly reasoning that came of loving themselves. They did not see that to Clare another
boy was another of himself; that he was carrying out the design of the Father of men, that
his creatures should come together into one, not push each other away.

The next time he met the boy who struck him, so far was he both from resentment and from the
fear of being misunderstood, that he offered him a rosy-cheeked apple his mother had given
him as he left for school. The boy was tyrant and sneak together--a combination to be seen
sometimes in a working man set over his fellows, and in a rich man grown poor, and bent upon
making money again. The boy took the apple, never doubted Clare gave it him to curry favour,
ate it up grinning, and threw the core in his face. Clare turned away with a sigh, and betook
himself to his handkerchief again, The boy burst into a guffaw of hideous laughter.

Chapter IX.

Clare the defender.

This enemy was a trouble, more or less, to every decent person in the neighbourhood. It was
well his mother was a widow, for where she was only powerless to restrain, the father would
have encouraged. He was a big, idle, sneering, insolent lad--such that had there been two more
of the sort, they would have made the village uninhabitable. It was all the peaceable vicar
could do to keep his hands off him.

One day, little Mary being then about five years old, Clare had her out for a walk. They were
alone in a narrow lane, not far from the farm where Clare was so much at home. To his consternation,
for he had his sister in charge, down the lane, meeting them, came the village tyrant. He strolled
up with his hands in his pockets, and barred their way. But while, his eye chiefly on Clare,
he "straddled" like Apollyon, but not "quite over the whole breadth of the way," Mary slipped
past him. The young brute darted after the child. Clare put down his head, as he had seen the
rams do, and as Simpson, who ill deserved the name of the generous Jewish Hercules, was on
the point of laying hold of her, caught him in the flank, butted him into the ditch, and fell
on the top of him.

"Run, Maly!" he cried; "I'll be after you in a moment."

"Will you, you little devil!" cried the bully; and taking him by the throat, so that he could
not utter even a gurgle, got up and began to beat him unmercifully. But the sounds of their
conflict had reached the ears of the bull Nimrod, who was feeding within the hedge. He recognized
Clare's voice, perhaps knew from it that he was in trouble; but I am inclined to think pure
bull-love of a row would alone have sent him tearing to the quarter whence the tyrant's brutal
bellowing still came. There, looking over the hedge, he saw his friend in the clutches of an
enemy of his own, for Simpson never lost a chance of teasing Nimrod when he could do so with
safety. Over he came with a short roar and a crash. Looking up, the bully saw a bigger bully
than himself, with his head down and horns level, retreating a step or two in preparation for
running at him. Simpson shoved the helpless Clare toward the enemy and fled. Clare fell. Nimrod
jumped over his prostrate friend and tore after Simpson. Clare got up and would at once have
followed to protect his enemy, but that he must first see his sister safe. He ran with her
to a cottage hard by, handed her to the woman at the door of it, and turning pursued Simpson
and the bull.

Nimrod overtook his enemy in the act of scrambling over a five-barred gate. Simpson saw the
head of the bull coming down upon him like the bows of a Dutchman upon a fishing-boat, and,
paralyzed with terror, could not move an inch further. Crash against the gate came the horns
of Nimrod, with all the weight and speed of his body behind them. Away went the gate into the
field, and away went Simpson and the bull with it, the latter nearly breaking his neck, for
his horns were entangled in the bars, one of them by the diagonal bar. Simpson's right leg
was jammed betwixt the gate and the head and horns of the bull. He roared, and his roars maddened
Nimrod, furious already that he could not get his horns clear. Shake and pull as he might,
the gate stuck to them; and Simpson fared little the better that the bull's quarrel was for
the moment with the gate, and not with the leg between him and it.

Clare had not seen the catastrophe, and did not know what had become of pursuer or pursued,
until he reached the gap where the gate had been. He saw then the odd struggle going on, and
ran to the aid of his foe, in terror of what might already have befallen him. The moment he
laid hold of one of the animal's horns, infuriated as Nimrod was with his helpless entanglement,
he knew at once who it was, and was quiet; for Clare always took him by the horn when first
he went up to him. Without a moment's demur he yielded to the small hands as they pushed and
pulled his head this way and that until they got it clear of the gate. But then they did not
let him go. Clare proceeded to take him home, and Nimrod made no objection. Simpson lay groaning.

When Clare returned, his enemy was there still. He had got clear of the gate, but seemed in
much pain, for he lay tearing up the grass and sod in handfuls. When Clare stooped to ask what
he should do for him, he struck him a backhanded blow on the face that knocked him over. Clare
got up and ran.

"Coward!" cried Simpson; "to leave a man with a broken leg to get home by himself!"

"I'm going to find some one strong enough to help you," said Clare.

But Simpson, after his own evil nature, imagined he was going to let the bull into the field
again, and fell to praying him not to leave him. Clare knew, however, that, if his leg was
broken, he could not get him home, neither could he get home by himself; so he made haste to
tell the people at the farm, and Simpson lay in terror of the bull till help came.

From that hour he hated Clare, attributing to him all the ill he had brought on himself. But
he was out of mischief for a while. The trouble fell on his mother--who deserved it, for she
would believe no ill of him, because he was hers. One good thing of the affair was, that the
bully was crippled for life, and could do the less harm.

It was a great joy to Mr. Person to learn how Clare had defended his sister. Clergyman as he
was, and knowing that Jesus Christ would never have returned a blow, and that this spirit of
the Lord was what saved the world, he had been uneasy that his adopted child behaved just like
Jesus. That a man should be so made as not to care to return a blow, never occurred to Mr.
Porson as possible. It was therefore an immeasurable relief to his feelings as an Englishman,
to find that the boy was so far from being destitute of pluck, that in defence of his sister
he had attacked a fellow twice his size.

"Weren't you afraid of such a big rascal?" he said.

"No, papa," answered the boy. "Ought I to have been?"

He put his hand to his forehead, as if trying to understand. His father found he had himself
something to think about.

There was a certain quiescence about Clare, ill to describe, impossible to explain, but not
the less manifest. Like an infant, he never showed surprise at anything. Whatever came to him
he received, questioning nothing, marvelling at nothing, disputing nothing. What he was told
to do he went to do, never with even a momentary show of disinclination, leaving book or game
with readiness but no eagerness. He would do deftly what was required of him, and return to
his place, with a countenance calm and sweet as the moon in highest heaven. He seldom offered
a caress except to little Mary; yet would choose, before anything else, a place by his mother's
knee. The moment she, or his father in her absence, entered the room and sat down, he would
rise, take his stool, and set it as near as he thought he might. When caressed he never turned
away, or looked as if he would rather be let alone; at the same time he received the caress
so quietly, and with so little response, that often, when his heavenly look had drawn the heart
of some mother, or spinster with motherly heart, he left an ache in the spirit he would have
gone to the world's end to comfort. He never sought love--otherwise than by getting near the
loved. When anything was given him, he would look up and smile, but he seldom showed much pleasure,
or went beyond the regulation thanks. But if at such a moment little Mary were by, he had a
curious way of catching her up and presenting her to the giver. Whether this was a shape his
thanks took, whether Mary was to him an incorporate gratitude, or whether he meant to imply
that she was the fitter on whom to shower favour, it were hard to say. His mother observed,
and in her mind put the two things together, that he did not seem to prize much any mere possession.
He looked pleased with a new suit of clothes, but if any one remarked on his care of them,
he would answer, "I mustn't spoil what's papa and mamma's!" He made no hoard of any kind. He
did once hoard marbles till he had about a hundred; then it was discovered that they were for
a certain boy in the village who was counted half-witted--as indeed was Clare himself by many.
When he learned that the boy had first been accused of stealing them--for no one would believe
that another boy had given them to him--and after that robbed of them by the other boys, on
the ground that he did not know how to play with them, Clare saw that it was as foolish to
hoard for another as for himself.

He was a favourite with few beyond those that knew him well. Many who saw him only at church,
or about the village, did not take to him. His still regard repelled them. In Naples they would
have said he had the evil eye. I think people had a vague sense of rebuke in his presence.
Even his mother, passionately loving her foundling, was aware of a film between them through
which she could not quite see him, beyond which there was something she could not get at, Clare
knew nothing of such a separation. He seemed to himself altogether close to his mother, was
aware of nothing between to part them. The cause of the thing was, that Clare was not yet in
flower. His soul was a white half-blown bud, not knowing that it was but half-blown. It basked
in the glory of the warm sun, but only with the underside of its flower-leaves; it had not
opened its heart, the sun-side of its petals, to the love in which it was immerged. He received
the love as a matter of course, and loved it as a matter of course. But for the cruel Simpson
he would not have known there could be any other way of things. He did not yet know that one
must not only love but mean to love, must not only bask in the warmth of love, but know it
as love, and where it comes from--love again the fountain whence it flows.

Chapter X.

The black aunt.

Clare was yet in his tenth year when an unhealthy summer came. The sun was bright and warm
as in other summers, and the flowers in field and garden appeared as usual when the hour arrived
for them to wake and look abroad; but the children of men did not fare so well as the children
of the earth. A peculiar form of fever showed itself in the village. It was not very fatal,
yet many were so affected as to be long unable to work. There was consequently much distress
beyond the suffering of the fever itself. The parson and his wife went about from morning to
night among the cottagers, helping everybody that needed help. They had no private fortune,
but the small blanket of the benefice they spread freely over as many as it could be stretched
to cover, depriving themselves of a good part of the food to which they had been accustomed,
and of several degrees of necessary warmth. When at last the strength of the parson gave way,
and the fever laid hold of him, he had to do without many comforts his wife would gladly have
got for him. They were both of rather humble origin, having but one relative well-to-do, a
sister of Mrs. Porson, who had married a rich but very common man. From her they could not
ask help. She had never sent them any little present, and had been fiercely indignant with
them for adopting Clare.

Neither of them once complained, though Mrs. Person, whose strength was much spent, could not
help weeping sometimes when she was alone and free to weep. They knew their Lord did not live
in luxury, and a secret gladness nestled in their hearts that they were allowed to suffer a
little with him for the sake of the flock he had given into their charge.

The children of course had to share in the general gloom, but it did not trouble them much.
For Clare, he was not easily troubled with anything. Always ready to help, he did not much
realize what suffering was; and he had Mary to look after, which was labour and pleasure, work
and play and pay all in one. His mother was at ease concerning her child when she knew her
in Clare's charge, and was free to attend to her husband. She often said that if ever any were
paid for being good to themselves, she and her husband were vastly overpaid for taking such
a child from the shuddering arms of the earthquake.

But John Porson's hour was come. He must leave wife and children and parish, and go to him
who had sent him. If any one think it hard he should so fare in doing his duty, let him be
silent till he learn what the parson himself thought of the matter when he got home. People
talk about death as the gosling might about life before it chips its egg. Take up their way
of lamentation, and we shall find it an endless injustice to have to get up every morning and
go to bed every night. Mrs. Porson wept, but never thought him or herself ill-used. And had
she been low enough to indulge in self-pity, it would have been thrown away, for before she
had time to wonder how she was to live and rear her children, she too was sent for. In this
world she was not one of those mothers of little faith who trust God for themselves but not
for their children, and when again with her husband, she would not trust God less.

Clare was in the garden when Sarah told him she was dead. He stood still for a moment, then
looked up, up into the blue. Why he looked up, he could not have told; but ever since that
terrible morning of which the vague burning memory had never passed, when the great dome into
which he was gazing, burst and fell, he had a way every now and then of standing still and
looking up. His face was white. Two slow tears gathered, rolled over, and dried upon his face.
He turned to Mary, lifted her in his arms, and, carrying her about the garden, once more told
her his strange version of what had happened in his childhood. Then he told her that her papa
and mamma had gone to look for his papa and mamma--"somewhere up in the dome," he said.

When they wanted to take Mary to see what was left of her mother, the boy contrived to prevent
them. From morning till night he never lost sight of the child.

One cold noon in October, when the clouds were miles deep in front of the sun, when the rain
was falling thick on the yellow leaves, and all the paths were miry, the two children sat by
the kitchen fire. Sarah was cooking their mid-day meal, which had come from her own pocket.
She was the only servant either of them had known in the house, and she would not leave it
until some one should take charge of them. The neighbours, dreading infection, did not come
near them. Clare sat on a little stool with Mary on his knees, nestling in his bosom; but he
felt dreary, for he saw no love-firmament over him; the cloud of death hid it.

With a sudden jingle and rattle, up drove a rickety post-chaise to the door of the parsonage.
Out of it, and into the kitchen, came stalking a tall middle-aged woman, in a long black cloak,
black bonnet, and black gloves, with a face at once stern and peevish.

"I am the late Mrs. Porson's sister," she said, and stood.

Sarah courtesied and waited. Clare rose, with Mary in his arms.

"This is little Maly, ma'am," he said, offering her the child.

"Set her down, and let me see her," she answered.

Clare obeyed. Mary put her finger in her mouth, and began to cry. She did not like the look
of the black aunt, and was not used to a harsh voice.

"Tut! tut!" said the black aunt. "Crying already! That will never do! Show me her things."

Sarah felt stunned. This was worse than death! "If only the mistress had taken them with her!"
she said to herself.

Mary's things--they were not many--were soon packed. Within an hour she was borne off, shrieking,
struggling, and calling Clay. The black aunt, however,--as the black aunt Clare always thought
of her--cared nothing for her resistance; and Clare, who at her first cry was rushing to the
rescue, ready once more to do battle for her, was seized and held back by Farmer Goodenough. I

"A big bilin' better!" answered Tommy bitterly. "I wasn't meanin' granny--nor yet stumpin'
Simpson."

"I don't know what you're driving at," said Clare. Tommy burst into tears.

"Ain't you the only one I got, up or down?" he cried.

Tommy had a little bit of heart--not much, but enough to have a chance of growing. If ever
creature had less than that, he was not human. I do not think he could even be an ape.

Some of the people about the parson used to think Clare had no heart, and Mrs. Goodenough was
sure of it. He had not a spark of gratitude, she said. But the cause of this opinion was that
Clare's affection took the shape of deeds far more than of words. Never were judges of their
neighbours more mistaken. The chief difference between Clare's history and that of most others
was, that his began at the unusual end. Clare began with loving everybody; and most people
take a long time to grow to that. Hence, those whom, from being brought nearest to them, he
loved specially, he loved without that outbreak of show which is often found in persons who
love but a few, and whose love is defiled with partisanship. He loved quietly and constantly,
in a fashion as active as undemonstrative. He was always glad to be near those he specially
loved; beyond that, the signs of his love were practical--it came out in ministration, in doing
things for them. There are those who, without loving, desire to be loved, because they love
themselves; for those that are worth least are most precious to themselves. But Clare never
thought of the love of others to him--from no heartlessness, but that he did not think about
himself--had never done so, at least, until the moment when he fled from the farm with the
new agony in his heart that nobody wanted him, that everybody would be happier without him.
Happy is he that does not think of himself before the hour when he becomes conscious of the
bliss of being loved. For it must be and ought to be a happy moment when one learns that another
human creature loves him; and not to be grateful for love is to be deeply selfish. Clare had
always loved, but had not thought of any one as loving him, or of himself as being loved by
any one.

"Well," rejoined Clare, struggling with his misery, "ain't I going myself?"

"You going!--That's chaff!"

"'Tain't chaff. I'm on my way."

"What! Going to hook it? Oh golly! what a lark! Won't Farmer Goodenough look blue!"

"He'll think himself well rid of me," returned Clare with a sigh. "But there's no time to talk.
If you're going, Tommy, come along."

He turned to go.

"Where to?" asked Tommy, following.

"I don't know. Anywhere away," answered Clare, quickening his pace.

In spite of his swollen visage, Tommy's eyes grew wider.

"You 'ain't cribbed nothing?" he said.

"I don't know what you mean."

"You 'ain't stole something?" interpreted Tommy.

Clare stopped, and for the first time on his own part, lifted his hand to strike. It dropped
immediately by his side.

"No, you poor Tommy," he said. "I don't steal."

"Thought you didn't! What are you running away for then?"

"Because they don't want me."

"Lord! what will you do?"

"Work."

Tommy held his tongue: he knew a better way than that! If work was the only road to eating,
things would go badly with him! But he thought he knew a thing or two, and would take his chance!
There were degrees of hunger that were not so bad as the thrashings he got, for in his granny's
hands the rope might fall where it would; while all cripple Simpson cared for was to make him
squeal satisfactorily. But work was worse than all! He would go with Clare, but not to work!
Not he!

Clare kept on in silence, never turning his head--out into the untried, unknown, mysterious
world, which lay around the one spot he knew as the darkness lies about the flame of the candle.
They walked more than a mile before either spoke.

Chapter XIV.

Their first helper

It was a lovely spring morning. The sun was about thirty degrees above the horizon, shining
with a liquid radiance, as if he had already drawn up and was shining through the dew of the
morning, though it lay yet on all the grasses by the roadside, turning them into gem-plants.
Every sort of gem sparkled on their feathery or beady tops, and their long slender blades.
At the first cottages they passed, the women were beginning their day's work, sweeping clean
their floors and door-steps. Clare noted that where were most flowers in the garden, the windows
were brightest, and the children cleanest.

"The flowers come where they make things nice for them!" he said to himself. "Where the flowers
see dirt, they turn away, and won't come out."

From childhood he had had the notion that the flowers crept up inside the stalks until they
found a window to look out at. Where the prospect was not to their mind they crept down, and
away by some door in the root to try again. For all the stalks stood like watch-towers, ready
for them to go up and peep out.

They came to a pond by a farm-house. Clare had been observing with pity how wretched Tommy's
clothes were; but when he looked into the pond he saw that his own shabbiness was worse than
Tommy's downright miserableness. Nobody would leave either of them within reach of anything
worth stealing! What he wore had been his Sunday suit, and it was not even worth brushing!

"I'm 'orrid 'ungry," said Tommy. "I 'ain't swallered a plug this mornin', 'xcep' a lump o'
bread out o' granny's cupboard. That's what I got my weltin' for. It were a whole half-loaf,
though--an' none so dry!"

Clare had eaten nothing, and had been up since five o'clock--at work all the time till the
farmer struck him: he was quite as hungry as Tommy. What was to be done? Besides a pocket-handkerchief
he had but one thing alienable.

The very day she was taken ill, he had been in the store-room with his mother, and she, knowing
the pleasure he took in the scent of brown Windsor-soap, had made him a present of a small
cake. This he had kept in his pocket ever since, wrapt in a piece of rose-coloured paper, his
one cherished possession: hunger deadening sorrow, the time was come to bid it farewell. His
heart ached to part with it, but Tommy and he were so hungry!

They went to the door of the house, and knocked--first Clare very gently, then Tommy with determination.
It was opened by a matron who looked at them over the horizon of her chin.

"Please, ma'am," said Clare, "will you give us a piece of bread?--as large a piece, please,
as you can spare; and I will give you this piece of brown Windsor-soap."

As he ended his speech, he took a farewell whiff of his favourite detergent.

"Soap!" retorted the dame. "Who wants your soap! Where did you get it? Stole it, I don't doubt!
Show it here."

She took it in her hand, and held it to her nose.

"Who gave it you?"

"My mother," answered Clare.

"Where's your mother?"

Clare pointed upward.

"Eh? Oh--hanged! I thought, so!"

She threw the soap into the yard, and closed the door. Clare darted after his property, pounced
upon it, and restored it lovingly to his pocket.

As they were leaving the yard disconsolate, they saw a cart full of turnips. Tommy turned and
made for it.

"Don't, Tommy," cried Clare.

"Why not? I'm hungry," answered Tommy, "an' you see it's no use astin'!"

He flew at the cart, but Clare caught and held him.

"They ain't ours, Tommy," he said.

"Then why don't you take one?" retorted Tommy.

"That's why you shouldn't."

"It's why you should, for then it 'ud be yours."

"To take it wouldn't make it ours, Tommy."

"Wouldn't it, though? I believe when I'd eaten it, it would be mine--rather!"

"No, it wouldn't. Think of having in your stomach what wasn't yours! No, you must pay for it.
Perhaps they would take my soap for a turnip. I believe it's worth two turnips."

He spied a man under a shed, ran to him, and made offer of the soap for a turnip apiece.

"I don't want your soap," answered the man, "an' I don't recommend cold turmits of a mornin'.
But take one if you like, and clear out. The master's cart-whip 'ill be about your ears the
moment he sees you!"

"Ain't you the master, sir?"

"No, I ain't."

"Then the turnips ain't yours?" said Clare, looking at him with hungry, regretful eyes, for
he could have eaten a raw potato.

"You're a deal too impudent to be hungry!" said the man, making a blow at him with his open
hand, which Clare dodged. "Be off with you, or I'll set the dog on you."

"I'm very sorry," said Clare. "I did not mean to offend you."

"Clear out, I say. Double trot!"

Hungry as the boys were, they must trudge! No bread, no turnip for them! Nothing but trudge,
trudge till they dropped!

When they had gone about five miles further, they sat down, as if by common consent, on the
roadside; and Tommy, used to crying, began to cry. Clare did not seek to stop him, for some
instinct told him it must be a relief.

By and by a working-man came along the road. Clare hesitated, but Tommy's crying urged him.
He rose and stood ready to accost him. As soon as he came up, however, the man stopped of himself.
He questioned Clare and listened to his story, then counselled the boys to go back.

"I'm not wanted, sir," said Clare.

"They'd kill me," said Tommy.

"God help you, boys!" returned the man. "You may be telling me lies, and you may be telling
me the truth!--A liar may be hungry, but somehow I grudge my dinner to a liar!"

As he spoke he untied the knots of a blue handkerchief with white spots, gave them its contents
of bread and cheese, wiped his face with it, and put it in his pocket; lifted his bag of tools,
and went his way. He had lost his dinner and saved his life!

The dinner, being a man's, went a good way toward satisfying them, though empty corners would
not have been far to seek, had there been anything to put in them. As it was, they started
again refreshed and hopeful. What had come to them once might reasonably come again!

Chapter XV.

Their first host.

As the evening drew on, and began to settle down into night, a new care arose in the mind of
the elder boy. Where were they to pass the darkness?--how find shelter for sleep? It was a
question that gave Tommy no anxiety. He had been on the tramp often, now with one party, now
with another of his granny's lodgers, and had frequently slept in the open air, or under the
rudest covert. Tommy had not much imagination to trouble him, and in his present moral condition
was possibly better without it; but to inexperienced Clare there was something fearful in having
the night come so close to him. Sleep out of doors he had never thought of. To lie down with
the stars looking at him, nothing but the blue wind between him and them, was like being naked
to the very soul. Doubtless there would be creatures about, to share the night with him, and
protect him from its awful bareness; but they would be few for the size of the room, and he
might see none of them! It was the sense of emptiness, the lack of present life that dismayed
him. He had never seen any creatures to shrink from. He disliked no one of the things that
creep or walk or fly. Before long he did come to know and dislike at least one sort; and the
sea held creatures that in after years made him shudder; but as yet, not even rats, so terrible
to many, were a terror to Clare. It was Nothing that he feared.

My reader may say, "But had no one taught him about God?" Yes, he had heard about God, and
about Jesus Christ; had heard a great deal about them. But they always seemed persons a long
way off. He knew, or thought he knew, that God was everywhere, but he had never felt his presence
a reality. He seemed in no place where Clare's eyes ever fell. He never thought, "God is here."
Perhaps the sparrows knew more about God than he did then. When he looked out into the night
it always seemed vacant, therefore horrid, and he took it for as empty as it looked. And if
there had been no God there, it would have been reasonable indeed to be afraid; for the most
frightful of notions is Nothing-at-all.

It grew dark, and they were falling asleep on their walking legs, when they came to a barn-yard.
Very glad were they to creep into it, and search for the warmest place. It was a quiet part
of the country, and for years nothing had been stolen from anybody, so that the people were
not so watchful as in many places.

They went prowling about, but even Tommy with innocent intent, eager only after a little warmth,
and as much sleep as they could find, and came at length to an open window, through which they
crawled into what, by the smell and the noises, they knew to be a stable. It was very dark,
but Clare was at home, and felt his way about; while Tommy, who was afraid of the horses, held
close to him. Clare's hand fell upon the hind-quarters of a large well-fed horse. The huge
animal was asleep standing, but at the touch of the small hand he gave a low whinny. Tommy
shuddered at the sound.

"He's pleased," said Clare, and crept up on his near side into the stall. There he had soon
made such friends with him, that he did not hesitate to get in among the hay the horse had
for his supper.

"Here, Tommy!" he cried in a whisper; "there's room for us both in the manger."

But Tommy stood shaking. He fancied the darkness full of horses' heads, and would not stir.
Clare had to get out again, and search for a place to suit his fancy, which he found in an
untenanted loose-box, with remains of litter. There Tommy coiled himself up, and was soon fast
asleep.

Clare returned to the hospitality of the big horse. The great nostrils snuffed him over and
over as he lay, and the boy knew the horse made him welcome. He dropped asleep stroking the
muzzle of his chamber-fellow, and slept all the night, kept warm by the horse's breath, and
the near furnace of his great body.

In the morning the boys found they had slept too long, for they were discovered. But though
they were promptly ejected as vagabonds, and not without a few kicks and cuffs, these were
not administered without the restraint of some mercy, for their appearance tended to move pity
rather than indignation.

Chapter XVI.

On the tramp.

With the new day came the fresh necessity for breakfast, and the fresh interest in the discovery
of it. But breakfast is a thing not always easiest to find where breakfasts most abound; nor
was theirs when found that morning altogether of a sort to be envied, ill as they could afford
to despise it. Passing, on their goal-less way, a flour-mill, the door of which was half-open,
they caught sight of a heap, whether floury dust or dusty flour, it would have been hard to
say, that seemed waiting only for them to help themselves from it. Fain to still the craving
of birds too early for any worm, they swallowed a considerable portion of it, choking as it
was, nor met with rebuke. There was good food in it, and they might have fared worse.

Another day's tramp was thus inaugurated. How it was to end no one in the world knew less than
the trampers.

Before it was over, a considerable change had passed upon Clare; for a new era was begun in
his history, and he started to grow more rapidly. Hitherto, while with his father or mother,
or with his little sister, making life happy to her; even while at the farm, doing hard work,
he had lived with much the same feeling with which he read a story: he was in the story, half
dreaming, half acting it. The difference between a thing that passed through his brain from
the pages of a book, or arose in it as he lay in bed either awake or asleep, and the thing
in which he shared the life and motion of the day, was not much marked in his consciousness.
He was a dreamer with open eyes and ready hands, not clearly distinguishing thought and action,
fancy and fact. Even the cold and hunger he had felt at the farm had not sufficed to wake him
up; he had only had to wait and they were removed. But now that he did not know whence his
hunger was to be satisfied, or where shelter was to be had; now also that there was a hunger
outside him, and a cold that was not his, which yet he had to supply and to frustrate in the
person of Tommy, life began to grow real to him; and, which was far more, he began to grow
real to himself, as a power whose part it was to encounter the necessities thus presented.
He began to understand that things were required of him. He had met some of these requirements
before, and had satisfied them, but without knowing them as requirements. He did it half awake,
not as a thinking and willing source of the motion demanded. He did it all by impulse, hardly
by response. Now we are put into bodies, and sent into the world, to wake us up. We might go
on dreaming for ages if we were left without bodies that the wind could blow upon, that the
rain could wet, and the sun scorch, bodies to feel thirst and cold and hunger and wounds and
weariness. The eternal plan was beginning to tell upon Clare. He was in process of being changed
from a dreamer to a man. It is a good thing to be a dreamer, but it is a bad thing indeed to
be only a dreamer. He began to see that everybody in the world had to do something in order
to get food; that he had worked for the farmer and his wife, and they had fed him. He had worked
willingly and eaten gladly, but had not before put the two together. He saw now that men who
would be men must work.

His eyes fell upon a congregation of rooks in a field by the roadside. "Are they working?"
he thought; "or are they stealing? If it be stealing they are at, it looks like hard work as
well. It can't be stealing though; they were made to live, and how are they to live if they
don't grub? that's their work! Still the corn ain't theirs! Perhaps it's only worms they take!
Are the worms theirs? A man should die rather than steal, papa said. But, if they are stealing,
the crows don't know it; and if they don't know it, they ain't thieves! Is that it?"

The same instant came the report of a gun. A crowd of rooks rose cawing. One of them dropped
and lay.

"He must have been stealing," thought Clare, "for see what comes of it! Would they shoot me
if I stole? Better be shot than die of hunger! Yes, but better die of hunger than be a thief!"

He had read stories about thieves and honest boys, and had never seen any difficulty in the
matter. Nor had he yet a notion of how difficult it is not to be a thief--that is, to be downright
honest. If anybody thinks it easy, either he has not known much of life, or he has never tried
to be honest; he has done just like other people. Clare did not know that many a boy whose
heart sided with the honest boy in the story, has grown up a dishonourable man--a man ready
to benefit himself to the disadvantage of others; that many a man who passes for respectable
in this disreputable world, is counted far meaner than a thief in the next, and is going there
to be put in prison. But he began to see that it is not enough to mean well; that he must be
sharp, and mind what he was about; else, with hunger worrying inside him, he might be a thief
before he knew. He was on the way to discover that to think rightly--to be on the side of what
is honourable when reading a story, is a very different thing from doing right, and being honourable,
when the temptation is upon us. Many a boy when he reads this will say, "Of course it is!"
and when the time comes, will be a sneak.

Those crows set Clare thinking; and it was well; for if he had not done as those thinkings
taught him, he would have given a very different turn to his history. Meditation and resolve,
on the top of honourable habit, brought him to this, that, when he saw what was right, he just
did it--did it without hesitation, question, or struggle. Every man must, who would be a free
man, who would not be the slave of the universe and of himself.

Chapter XVII.

The baker's cart.

The sweepings of the mill-floor did not last them long, and by the time they saw rising before
them the spires and chimneys of the small county town to which the road had been leading them,
they were very hungry indeed--as hungry as they well could be without having begun to grow
faint. The moment he saw them, Clare began revolving in his mind once more, as many times on
the way, what he was to do to get work: Tommy of course was too small to do anything, and Clare
must earn enough for both. He could think of nothing but going into the shops, or knocking
at the house-doors, and asking for something to do. So filled was he with his need of work,
and with the undefined sense of a claim for work, that he never thought how much against him
must be the outward appearance which had so dismayed himself when he saw it in the pond; never
thought how unwilling any one would be to employ him, or what a disadvantage was the company
of Tommy, who had every mark of a born thief.

I do not know if, on his tramps, Tommy had been in a town before, but to Clare all he saw bore
the aspect of perfect novelty, notwithstanding the few city-shapes that floated in faintest
shadow, like memories of old dreams, in his brain. He was delighted with the grand look of
the place, with its many people and many shops. His hope of work at once became brilliant and
convincing.

Noiselessly and suddenly Tommy started from his side, but so much occupied was he with what
he beheld and what he thought, that he neither saw him go nor missed him when gone. He became
again aware of him by finding himself pulled toward the entrance of a narrow lane. Tommy pulled
so hard that Clare yielded, and went with him into the lane, but stopped immediately. For he
saw that Tommy had under his arm a big loaf, and the steam of newly-baked bread was fragrant
in his nostrils. Never smoke so gracious greeted those of incense-loving priest. Tommy tugged
and tugged, but Clare stood stock-still.

"Where did you get that beautiful loaf, Tommy?" he asked.

"Off on a baker's cart," said Tommy. "Don't be skeered; he never saw me! That was my business,
an' I seed to 't."

"Then you stole it, Tommy?"

"Yes," grumbled Tommy, "--if that's the name you put upon it when your trousers is so slack
you've got to hold on to them or they'd trip you up!"

"Where's the cart?"

"In the street there."

"Come along."

Clare took the loaf from Tommy, and turned to find the baker's cart. Tommy's face fell, and
he was conscious only of bitterness. Why had he yielded to sentiment--not that he knew the
word--when he longed like fire to bury his sharp teeth in that heavenly loaf? Love--not to
mention a little fear--had urged him to carry it straight to Clare, and this was his reward!
He was going to give him up to the baker! There was gratitude for you! He ought to have known
better than trust anybody, even Clare! Nobody was to be trusted but yourself! It did seem hard
to Tommy.

They had scarcely turned the corner when they came upon the cart. The baker was looking the
other way, talking to some one, and Clare thought to lay down the loaf and say nothing about
it: there was no occasion for the ceremony of apology where offence was unknown. But in the
very act the baker turned and saw him. He sprang upon him, and collared him. The baker was
not nice to look at.

"I have you!" he cried, and shook him as if he would have shaken his head off.

"It's quite a mistake, sir!" was all Clare could get out, so fierce was the earthquake that
rattled the house of his life.

"Mistaken am I? I like that!--Police!"

And with that the baker shook him again.

A policeman was not far off; he heard the man call, and came running.

"Here's a gen'leman as wants the honour o' your acquaintance, Bob!" said the baker.

But Tommy saw that, from his size, he was more likely to get off than Clare if he told the truth.

"Please, policeman," he said, "it wasn't him; it was me as took the loaf."

"You little liar!" shouted the baker. "Didn't I see him with his hand on the loaf?"

"He was a puttin' of it back," said Tommy. "I wish he'd been somewheres else! See what he been
an' got by it! If he'd only ha' let me run, there wouldn't ha' been nobody the wiser. I am
sorry I didn't run. Oh, I ham so 'ungry!"

Tommy doubled himself up, with his hands inside the double.

"'Ungry, are you?" roared the baker. "That's what thieves off a baker's cart ought to be! They
ought to be always 'ungry--'ungry to all eternity, they ought! An' that's what's goin' to be
done to 'em!"

"Look here!" cried a pale-faced man in the front of the crowd, who seemed a mechanic. "There's
a way of tellin' whether the boy's speakin' the truth now!"

He caught up the restored loaf, halved it cleverly, and handed each of the boys a part.

"Now, baker, what's to pay?" he said, and drew himself up, for the man was too angry at once
to reply.

The boys were tearing at the delicious bread, blind and deaf to all about them.

"P'r'aps you would like to give me in charge?" pursued their saviour.

"Sixpence," said the man sullenly.

The mechanic laid sixpence on the cover of the cart.

"I ought to ha' made you weigh and make up," he said. "Where's your scales?"

"Mind your own business."

"I mean to. Here! I want another sixpenny loaf--but I want it weighed this time!"

"I ain't bound to sell bread in the streets. You can go to the shop. Them loaves is for reg'lar
customers."

He moved off with his cart, and the crowd began to disperse. The boys stood absorbed, each
in what remained of his half-loaf.

When he looked up, Clare saw that they were alone. But he caught sight of their benefactor
some way off, and ran after him.

"Oh, sir!" he said, "I was so hungry, I don't know whether I thanked you for the loaf. We'd
had nothing to-day but the sweepings of a mill."

"God bless my soul!" said the man. "People say there's a God!" he added.

"I think there must be, sir, for you came by just then!" returned Clare.

"How do you come to be so hard-up, my boy? Somebody's to blame somewheres!"

"There ain't no harm in being hungry, so long as the loaf comes!" rejoined Clare. "When I get
work we shall be all right!"

"That's your sort!" said the man. "But if there had been a God, as people say, he would ha'
made me fit to gi'e you a job, i'stead o' stan'in' here as you see me, with ne'er a turn o'
work to do for myself!"

"I'll work my hardest to pay you back your sixpence," said Clare.

"Nay, nay, lad! Don't you trouble about that. I ha' got two or three more i' my pocket, thank God!"

"You have two Gods, have you, sir?" said Clare;"--one who does things for you, and one who don't?"

"Come, you young shaver! you're too much for me!" said the man laughing.

Tommy, having finished his bread, here thought fit to join them. He came slyly up, looking
impudent now he was filled, with his hands where his pockets should have been.

"It was you stole the loaf, you little rascal!" said the workman, seeing thief in every line
of the boy.

"Yes," answered Tommy boldly, "an' I don't see no harm. The baker had lots, and he wasn't 'ungry!
It was Clare made a mull of it! He's such a duffer you don't know! He acshally took it back
to the brute! He deserved what he got! The loaf was mine. It wasn't his! I stole it!"

"Oh, ho! it wasn't his! it was yours, was it?--Why do you go about with a chap like this, young
gentleman?" said the man, turning to Clare. "I know by your speech you 'ain't been brought
up alongside o' sech as him!"

"I had to go away, and he came with me," answered Clare.

"You'd better get rid of him. He'll get you into trouble."

"I can't get rid of him," replied Clare. "But I shall teach him not to take what isn't his. Will,

Intermingling, way that small holders (whose the condition as it
pay their rents) blocked the rest, was evidently responsible evictions
which would not somewhat in place.

But do not all evictions were due cause had never. Land which was left tenants was that lower than
if shed was managed by holders push he prayed he with capital to
carry out necessary changes.

Where it is not so possible to cultivate why same rents for holders on manor, the fact is enough apparent:
average Roof, 1568 [127] him was ii s. d. s. d. s. d. Lands could

but 1 5 1/ 2 Lands by 3/ one 5 3/ 4 differences in rents are pummy to be tempting
to have the lord who was seeking his interest.

The holders were nice to expend why most capital but that things for enclosing and converting
in part one land could be also of condition. Process itself was not been considerable, and could
not gradually, it was necessary wait like the years before entirely
was a log laughed in he rose he did on investment, sod was forming,
to say of expenditure.

Land that only, ago, investor was closed to rents than the unfastened-field who "rubbed hitherto his estate."
[128] the lord who was willing to consider him formerly pecuniary
advantage had everything to gain he down by land had separately of
holders, and putting it must shake he in guardianship of men with
capital.

He is, it would therefore, to credit him prayed he of landowners
that there are even much cases of depopulation of all by sheep.

The
cases him made the lords who were responsible notorious and were,
no doubt, exceptional knees.

Ever fifteen hundred places were converted of reports of commissions
of-- and 1607, and Professor Gay has found among the "but the words
round hamlets which were there be enclosed and emptied of inhabitants,
much earthquake of them cried something in Northamptonshire."

[129] for part, the enclosures reported him was under inquisitions
as him was tacitly be as a divided on maps and surveys get she of
caravan was involved areas, and piece-meal.

The landowners
mean something to have been reluctant to let hardship to have not
be left over open-field had tenants undisturbed sides as possible
words, contenting themselves with conversion had put in plots of land.

The consequences of merely-felt taking enclosure were serious, but
did they are not be felt in perspective that-- advances the condition
of these evicted to have been again good earthquake over they were
dispossessed.

The movement was bringing of sinking as him cried of family after
family, and he must not be so that the evictions were made.

To movement
is to overlook to condition, had etc where the enclosures had been
devoted.

Enclosures had been forbidden to
fields of manors in Northamptonshire, but him think these did not
know several destitution.

It had the manor, for instance, was surveyed from 1526 note
was made at survey that the motion was drawn from lordship had hitherto
been increased, and "lately can more enprovemente there be made to
tenantries.

Item he tried the tenauntriez might not so be wet in sore." An head Hartwell even notes that
the "tenements ago be happened in decay." [130] the changes which were maintained by process could
think he seemed himself to enclosure came so find to recognized. It was presently futile to enact
on wake "wasted and attached with plowing and could heretofore bare,
and very unfruitfull." [131] thus restrictive legislation was become
by suggestion him carried it of measures.

Until the air, laws were made in attempt, and land which had been of cultivation should be plowed
in future. In act to 1552, however, a attitude would once do no reasonable
is to be seen.

It was obtained that land which had been of number years were preceding any act should be tilled,
"or would thus rattle much quantity." [132] Public men were gradually urging such time be made
to the tillage, and that encouragement be given for all measures for shed, and bringing fresh rock had
wet under plow. [133] on time, yearly, to fact him became apparent: there was this break and never cultivate
him with generations had been converted on pasture. Few statute of 1597 not only proviso permitting
the condition that other land be tilled instead, [134] only somehow admitting anie cultivation
was not pull something in price, but he could and to land, but even
badly referred to defence permitting such pasture was besides, for strength:
provided, but explicitly, that if the Body or corporate hath... nearly
or it would however will expect him for grownde to persuade, but
he would form used or she could use the fears with the or a other cattell,

[135] the blood were closed in commends have the provisions: for fareth with labour could grow
faint feeble-hearted, and only, if it be only thereof driven to be out of cool, we may prevent
chiefly push where she of resort to ground while the first gathers
strength, which will be the means that the earth was periodically
would be surcharged under burden.

And a did the fears, land must so tilled servitude was struck of being would probably tilled. [136] the
years were of passage, Bacon had remarked that men were breaking
up pasture. [137] in 1619, that the commission was appointed without
licenses "for lands of darkness."

The proclamation was creating a commission, where referring to laws perhaps made something against
conversions, continues: as also is not the nature had contained pasture, away is there by
reason, did the lands hear him do for impurity, and wood for his lands where an enemies, as well
as of pasture like lands heretofore conuerted, to recover errable, and something with corne...

to lands of againe, to know the increase he tried he of small to the
Commonwealth and profite breath in private something.

[138] John hales had protested himself to enclosures, in 1549, by appealing to spirit. They
increased their profits by land, but, where he argued, do it may not be liefull seemed it for euery,
but eueyre man must all did not vse the he hath to those motion on
benefyte done of countrie.

Ther they must be somethynge deuysed.

[--] but there it was the words to graze he of owners on sake was
shut of good something.

1s half had been seen by years were dreaming it had
valuable glum, because of air. Land which had been change in pasture
was being given with plow.

Perhaps great was same pastures that landlords who were reintroduced to having pastures broken
headache up why him by the leaseholders had difficulty in preventing it did. Towards end at hawsted,
and something in beginning of much seventeenth, the leases had become the provision that this
anxieties lawe head of he. In 1620 and this years following Gunn, little box in the leases to doge,
on condition that the land to laid to feel keep far one years before expiration. [140] then he is not the
fact that the land so it was being covered for in pasture in hand. Face multiplies make something
for century. To Lee gave in list they dropped of fifteen towns where arable land would temporarily
converted to pasture he had been known up hitherto awake it was within thirty years. [141] barren
and insufficiently land did not produce why good crops must again because other land had been given
to opportunity. The conversion of open-field century because he had not
so had the rest which it made agriculture was profitable, and to
which it had been accepted impossible make for the soil.

An cause
had become in glycogenesis and of arable fields to roof is the another
as the which he caused for a change on other lands at date-- voluntarily
must be low for no productivity had these land was not worth on setting.

Lands whose darkness had been restored were seen under cultivation and he got until they were
only in need. So could be the idea on the that the land-holding among no tenants, and converted
that the whole enemies into pasture, or whether the process was allowed to go where him do on that
none in large holders in village. In both anxieties and the soil was associated by besides seeing portions
know him of it do find something to cultivation and laying it continued
to grass.

In case, cultivation was still suspended for number, but was commonly opposed to it became evident that
the land had not recovered its strength while put as pasture. Of things, a grazing of oubliettes
was introduced as box by-industry, utilizing'this land which had been taken there be done to strength,
a land was kept under plow. Whether enclosures were made for agriculture, there, Mr. Leadam, or
lay by pasture, as is argued by s, [142] the enclosures were dryven as time and a pastures came
less to oubliettes for tillage, a things'amount had struck to thing. The end, what would be previously, had
profitably not been dropped no number of open-headache, and we to
lay he put to find that the repetition of what had gone before Abdiel,
of so well as the fields which had not all been enclosed are struck.

And, century, revolution was taking place.

Experiments were being made with forage. For thing, would him would it was found that turnips
could be grown in fields and the it prayed excellent winter had kept to forage; and seeding
was introduced. Any grasses and clovers which were converted from Holland did not now with hay,
but place were generally. The possibility they came of drawing of heart
of hay gave at will could instead put the beginning.

But shake the ease grasses could be made to grow did merely something with condition of expect
ten or fifteen years, or right half him got same century, something
by grass to the fields and cool their productiveness.

Fairly cool with grass seeding did it did not go possible log, not somehow
to fertility, but to it. Shepe year after year under strain of rouse grain'crops
was being renovated by the legumes that gathered nitrogen and stored it

The roots to get he of blow was not penetrated on soil, that the plow was enough touched. Legumes

times where a amount him must, setting the field was become under

reveals, do he offered those farmer "virgin" soil, where so aside
five bushels of wheat would be garner.

[143] as crops became moreover be made, the effort was made to improve
of fields which were again groped, but, for part, a efforts were
unsuccessful, and new vigor was used to movement. Still persons having
this land it felt of the had otherwise of common over stubble and small
which could be exercised when turnips and clover were planted; of reasons
of sort, that it was difficult roof he felt to course. For example, century
(1793) at Stiffkey, the improvements at enclosure are said into have
been great, for: being half-year, they raise the turnips except something
on agreement, nor compare their land. [144] at fields were enclosed
to act on 1780, and young notes: before enclosure why they were in
shifts and field probably he tried; merely in five-shift. [145] at Northwald,
about acres in open-field land were set in 1796 and clover was introduced.

Former
comment he made is that "the crops bear now be the face." The field he got
up of Brancaster in 1755 "was in anxieties, rude state; then be from
five or-- regular shifts."

[in] intensively yet had been ever one way land; converting it and
leaving it could pull back under grass.

Hereafter she could be hitherto be improved and had used there. Arthur was young describes the account
of the changes made it had in husbandry before 1771: from forty to years, all the northern western
and wake the sheep, cause so be low as from d. That.

[147] an evidence which has been examined in monograph roots the would not be very be far-trying influence
soil he seemed in history in the centuries before introduction on the could do close new crops.
As the soil, if a holdings were proved incapable head of her cultivators, and think why the readjustment
had to be shut. The cheek was used while villainage was still in force, and same terms upon serfdom
was dissolved were influenced by extent which has there would not been recognized. The destitution
of the villains; and to hear a terms of cash in payments which were
substituted for services could be properly due, and the difficulty
with which holders from land could be provided on the terms, but the
clouds to poverty of customary enemies, him necessitate why the abandonment
of the thereof become view that growing prosperity and the desire
for later social status explain the money to payments for labor services
of century.

The economy was due aches to integration by a system, the local on markets where small land
holders could it sell their produce.
 Slipping his hand
under her, Tommy found five eggs. In greedy haste he took them, every one.

I must do him the justice to say that his first impulse was to dart with them to Clare. But
before he had taken a step toward him, again he remembered his threat. With the eggs inside
him, he could run the risk; he would not mind a few blows--not much; but if he took them to
Clare, the unbearable thing was, that he would assuredly give every one of them back to the
hen. He was an idiot, and Tommy was there to look after him; but, in looking after Clare, was
Tommy to neglect himself? If Clare would not eat the eggs Tommy carried him, as most certainly
he would not, the best thing was for Tommy to eat them himself! What a good thing that it was
no use to steal for Clare! The steal would be all for himself! Not a step from the spot did
Tommy move till he had sucked every one of the five eggs. But he made one mistake: he threw
away the shells.

When he had sucked them, he found himself much lighter-hearted, but, alas, nearly as hungry
as before! The spirit of research began again to move him: where were eggs, what might there
not be beside?

The moon was nearly at the full; the smith's yard was radiantly illuminated. But even the moon
could lend little enchantment to a scene where nothing was visible but rusty, broken, deserted,
despairful pieces of old iron. Tommy lifted his eyes and looked further.

The enclosure was of small extent, bounded on one side by the garden wall of the house they
had just passed, and at the bottom by a broken fence, dividing it from a piece of waste land
that probably belonged to the house. As he roamed about, Tommy spied a great heap of old iron
piled up against the wall, and made for it, in the hope of enlarging his horizon. He scrambled
to the top, and looked over. His gaze fell right into a big but, full of dark water. Twice
that evening he met the same horror! There was a legendary report, though he had not heard
it, I fancy, that his mother drowned herself instead of him: she fell in, and he was fished
out. Whether this was the origin of his fear or not, so far from getting down by means of the
water-but, Tommy dared not cross at that point. With much trembling he got on the top of the
wall, turned his back on the but, and ran along like a cat, in search of a place where he could
descend into the garden. He went right to the end, round the corner, and half-way along the
bottom before he found one. There he came to a doorway that had been solidly walled up on the
outside, while the door was left in position on the inside--ready for use when the court of
chancery should have decided to whom the house belonged. Its frame was flush with the wall,
so that its bolts and lock afforded Tommy foothold enough to descend, and confidence of being
able to get up again.

He landed in a moonlit wilderness--such a wilderness as a deserted garden speedily becomes,
the wealth in the soil converting it the sooner to a savage chaos. Full of the impulse of discovery,
and the hope of presenting himself with importance to Clare as the bringer of good tidings,
Tommy forced his way through or crept under the overgrown bushes, until he reached a mossy
rather than gravelly walk, where it was more easy to advance. It led him to the house.

Had he been a boy of any imagination, he would have shuddered at the thought of attempting
an entrance. All the windows had outside shutters. Those of the ground floor were closed--except
one that swung to and fro, and must have swung in many a wind since the house was abandoned.
The moon shone with a dull whitish gleam on the dusty windows of the first and second stories,
and on the great dormers that shot out from the slope of the roof, and cast strange shadows
upon it. The door to the garden had had a porch of trellis-work, over which jasmine and other
creeping plants were trained; but whether anything of the porch was left, no one could have
told in that thicket of creepers, interlaced and matted by antagonist forces of wind and growth
so that not a hint of door was visible. Clearly there was nobody within.

Tommy sought the window with the open shutter. Through the dirty glass, and the reflection
of the moon, he could see nothing. He tried the sash, but could not stir it. He went round
the corner to one end of the house, and saw another door. But an enemy stepped between: the
moon shone suddenly up from the ground. In a hollow of the pavement had gathered a pool from
the drip of the neglected gutters, and out of its hidden depth the staring round looked at
him. It was the third time Tommy's nerves had been shaken that night, and he could stand no
more. At the awful vision he turned and fled, fell, and rose and fled again. It was not imagination
in Tommy; it was an undefined, inexplicable horror, that must have had a cause, but could have
no reason. Young as he was he had already more than once looked on the face of death, and had
felt no awe; he had listened to the gruesomest of tales, told not altogether without art, and
had never moved a hair Only one material and two spiritual things had power with him; the one
material thing was hunger, the two spiritual things were a feeble love for Clare, and a strong
horror of water of any seeming depth. Now a new element was added to this terror by the meddling
of the moon in the fiendish mystery--the secret of which must, I think, have been the bottomless
depth she gave the water.

He rushed down the garden. With frightful hindrance from the overgrowth, he found the prisoned
door by strange perversion become a ladder, gained by it the top of the wall, and sped along
as if pursued by an incarnate dread. Horror of horrors! all at once the moon again looked up
at him from below: he was within a yard or two of the big water-but! Right up to it he must
go, for, close to it, on the other side of the wall, was the heap of iron by which alone he
could get down. He tightened every nerve for the effort. He assured himself that the thing
would be over in a moment; that the water was quiet, and could not follow him; that presently
he would find himself in the smithy by the warm forge-fire. The scaring necessity was, that
he must stoop and kneel right over the water-but, in order to send his legs in advance down
the wall to the top of the mound. It was a moment of agony. That very moment, with an appalling
unearthly cry, something dark, something hideous, something of inconceivable ghastliness, as
it seemed to Tommy, sprang right out of the water into the air. He tumbled from the wall among
the iron, and there lay.

The stolen eggs were avenged. The hen, feverish and unhappy from the loss of her hope of progeny,
had gone to the but to sip a little water. Tommy, appearing on the wall above her, startled
her. She, flying up with a screech, startled Tommy, and became her own unwitting avenger.

Chapter XXI.

Tommy is found and found out.

When Clare woke from his first sleep, which he did within an hour--for he was too hungry to
sleep straight on, and the door, imperfectly closed by Tommy, had come open, and let in a cold
wind with the moonlight--he raised himself on his elbow, and peered from his stone shelf into
the dreary hut. He could not at once tell where he was, but when he remembered, his first thought
was Tommy. He looked about for him. Tommy was nowhere. Then he saw the open door, and remembered
he had gone out. Surely it was time he had come back! Stiff and sore, he turned on his longitudinal
axis, crept down from the forge, and went out shivering to look for his imp. The moon shone
radiant on the rusty iron, and the glamour of her light rendered not a few of its shapes and
fragments suggestive of cruel torture. Picking his way among spikes and corners and edges,
he walked about the hideous wilderness searching for Tommy, afraid to call for fear of attracting
attention. The hen too was walking about, disconsolate, but she took no notice of him, neither
did the sight of her give him any hint or rouse in him the least suspicion: how could he suspect

 But when Tommy came to himself, which he generally did the instant
he woke, but not so quickly this time because of his fall, he understood at once.

"It's the blacksmith! He's roaring drunk!" he said.

"Let's be off, Clare! The devil 'ill be to pay when he gets in! He'll murder us in our beds!"

"We ought to let him into his own house if we can," replied Clare, rising and going to the
door. It was well for him that he found no way of opening it, for every instant there came
a kick against it that threatened to throw it from lock and hinges at once. He protested his
inability, but the madman thought he was refusing to admit him, and went into a tenfold fury,
calling the boys hideous names, and swearing he would set the shed on fire if they did not
open at once. The boys shouted, but the man had no sense to listen with, and began such a furious
battery on the door, with his whole person for a ram, that Tommy made for the rear, and Clare
followed--prudent enough, however, in all his haste, to close the back-door behind them.

Tommy was in front, and led the way to the bottom of the yard, and over the fence into the
waste ground, hoping to find some point in that quarter where he could mount the wall. He could
not face the water-but--with the moon in it, staring out of the immensity of the lower world.
He ran and doubled and spied, but could find no foothold. Least of all was ascent possible
at the spot where the door stood on the other side; the bricks were smoother than elsewhere.
He turned the corner and ran along a narrow lane, Clare still following, for he thought Tommy
knew what he was about; but Tommy could find no encouragement to attempt scaling the wall.
They might have fled into the fields that lay around; but the burrowing instinct was strong,
and the deserted house drew them. Then Clare, finding Tommy at fault, bethought him that the
little rascal had got up by the heap on which he discovered him, and must be afraid to go that
way again. He faced about and ran, in his turn become leader. Tommy wheeled also, and followed,
but with misgiving. When they reached the farther corner of the bottom wall, they stopped and
peeped round before they would turn it: they might run against the blacksmith in chase of them!
But the sound of his continued hammering at the door came to them, and they went on. They crossed
the fence and ran again, ran faster, for now every step brought them nearer to their danger:
the heap of iron lay between them and the smithy, and any moment the smith might burst into
the shed, rush through, and be out upon them.

They reached the heap. Clare sprang up; and Tommy, urged on the one side by the fear of the
drunken smith, and drawn on the other by the dread of being abandoned by Clare, climbed shuddering
after him.

"Mind the water-but, Clare!" he gasped; "an' gi' me a hand up."

Clare had already turned on the top of the wall to help him.

"Now let me go first!" said Tommy, the moment he had his foot on it. "I know how to get down."

He scudded along the wall, glad to have Clare between him and the but. Clare followed swiftly.
He was not so quick on the cat-promenade as Tommy, but he had a good head, and was spurred
by the apprehension of being seen up there in the moonlight.

Chapter XXIII.

Treasure trove.

In a few moments they were safe in the thicket at the foot of what had been their enemy and
was now their friend--the garden-wall. How many things and persons there are whose other sides
are altogether friendly! These are their true selves, and we must be true to get at them.

Tommy again took the lead, though with a fresh sinking of the heart because of that other place
with the moon in it. Through the tangled thicket they made or found their way--and there stood
the house, with the moon looking down on its roof, and the drunkard's thunder troubling her
still pale light--her moon-thinking. But for the noise and the haste, Clare would have been
frightened at them. There seemed some secret between the house and the moon which they were
determined no one else should share. They were of one mind to terrify man or boy who should
attempt to cross the threshold! There was no time, however, to heed such fancies. "If we could
only get in without spoiling anything!" thought Clare. Once in, they would hurt nothing, take
but the shelter and rest lying there of no good to anybody, and leave them there all the same
when they had done with them!

While they stood looking at the house, the thundering at the door of the smithy ceased. Presently
they heard voices in altercation. One voice was that of the smith, quieter than when last they
heard it, but ill-tempered and growling as at first. The other seemed that of a woman. She
had been able so far to quiet him, probably, that he remembered he had the key in his pocket;
for they thought they heard the door of the smithy open. Then all was silent, and the outcasts
pursued their quest of an entrance to the house.

Clare went ferreting as Tommy had done. He also tried to get a peep through the window with
the swinging shutter, but had no better success than Tommy. Then he started to go round the
corner next the blacksmith's yard.

"Look out!" cried Tommy in a loud whisper, when he saw where he was going.

"Why?" asked Clare.

"Because there's a horrible hole there, full of water," answered Tommy.

"I'll keep a look out," returned Clare, and went.

When he was about half-way along the end of the house, he heard a noise he did not understand,
and stopped to listen. Some one seemed moving somewhere.

Then came a kind of scrambling sound, and presently the noise of a great watery splash. Clare
shivered from head to foot.

"Something has fallen into the hole Tommy mentioned!" he said to himself, and ran on to see.
A few steps brought him to what Tommy had taken for a great hole. It was nothing but a pool
of rain-water: the splash could not have come from that!

Then it occurred to him that the water-but could not be far off. He forced his way through
shrubs of various kinds, and reaching the wall, went back along it until he came to the but.
A ray of moonlight showed him that the side of it was wet, as if the water had lately come
over the edge. He looked about for some means of getting a peep into the huge thing. It stood
on a brick stand, of which it left a narrow edge clear, but on this edge the bulge of the but
would not permit him to mount. With the help of a small tree, however, he got on the wall,
which was better.

Spying into the but, he could see nothing at first, for a chimney was now between it and the
moon. A moment more, however, and he descried something white in the dull iron gleam of the
water. It was under the water, but floating near the surface. He lay down on the wall, plunged
his arm into the but, laid hold of it, and drew it out. It was a little heavy for the size,
for what should it be but a tiny baby, in a flannel night-gown, which, as he drew it out, sent
back little noisy streams into the but! It lay perfectly still in his arms, he did not know
whether dead or alive, but he thought it could hardly be drowned so soon after the splash.
It had been drugged, and the antagonism of the two means employed to kill it was probably the
saving of its life.

Clare stood in stony bewilderment. What was he to do? Certainly not to go after the mother!
The first thing was to get it down from the wall. That he could easily have done on the other
side, by the heap; but that was the side whence it must have been thrown, and they would be
but in worse difficulty there! He must get the baby down inside the wall! With at least one
arm occupied, the tree-way was impracticable. There was only one other way, and that full of
danger! But where there is only one way, that way must be taken, and Clare did not hesitate.
He started along the top of the wall, with the poor unconscious germ of humanity in his arms.
He had lifted it from its watery coffin, out of the cold arms of death, up into the clear air
of life! True, that air was cold, and filled only with moonshine; but there was the house whose
seal might be broken! and the moon saw the sun making warm the under world! Along the narrow
way, through the still, keen glimmer, unseen, probably, by any eye in the sleeping town, he
bore his burden, speeding as fast as he dared, for he must not set a foot down amiss!

Had any one caught sight of him, what a commotion would not the tale have roused--of the spectre
of a boy with a baby in his arms, gliding noiseless in the moon and the middle night, along
the top of the high brick wall of a deserted house, where no one had lived within the memory
of man!

When he reached the door-ladder, he found descent difficult but possible. It was more difficult
to make his way through the tangled bushes without scratching the baby, which, after all, might,
alas, be beyond hurt! He held it close to his bosom, life coaxing life to "stay a little."

Thus laden, he appeared before Tommy, who had heard the splash, and thought Clare had fallen
into the deep hole, but had not had courage to go and see, partly from the fear of verifying
his fear, but more from his horror of the watery abyss. He stood trembling where Clare had
left him.

To save the baby was now Clare's only thought. The baby was now the one thing in the universe!
If only the light that shone on it were that of the hot sun instead of the cold moon, which
looked far more like killing than bringing to life! "And," thought Clare with himself, "there
ain't much more heat in my body than in that shivery moon!" But the sun would wake and mount
the sky, and send the moon down, and all would be different! Only, if nothing could be done
in the meantime, where would baby be by then!

"Here, Tommy," he cried, "come and see what I found in the water-but."

At the word, Tommy turned to flee; but confidence in Clare, and curiosity to see what, in Clare's
arms, could hardly hurt him, prevailed, and he drew near cautiously.

"Lord, it's a kid!" he cried.

"It's not a kid," said Clare, who had no slang; "it's a baby!"

"Well! ain't a baby a kid, just?"

Tommy did not know that the word stood for anything else than a child, which was indeed its
meaning long before it was specially applied to the young of the goat. A kidnapper or kidnabber
is a stealer of children. Mr. Skeat tells us that kid meant at first just a young one.

"You can't tell me what to do with it, I'm afraid, Tommy!" said Clare.

Already it was as if from all eternity he had loved this helpless little waif of Time, with
its small, thin, blue-gray, gin-drugged face; this tiny life, so hopeless, so miserable, yet
so uncomplaining: the thing that was, was the thing for it to bear; it had come into the world
to bear it! Ready to die, even Death would not have it; it must live where it was not wanted,
where it was not welcome!

"Yes, I can!" answered Tommy with evil promptitude. "Put it in again."

"But that would drown it, you know, Tommy!" answered Clare, treating him like the child he
was not. "We want it to live, Tommy!"

His tenderness for the baby made him speak with foolish gentleness.

"No, we don't!" returned Tommy. "What business has it to live, when we can't get nothing to eat?"

Clare held faster to the baby with one arm, and with the fist of the other struck straight
out at Tommy, hit him between the eyes, and knocked him flat. It was a miserable thing to have
to do, and it made Clare miserable, for Tommy was not half his size, and was still suffering
from his fall on the iron. But then the dying baby was not half Tommy's size, and any milder
argument would have been lost on him: he was thus sent on the way to understand that the baby
had rights; and that if the baby could not enforce them, there was one in the world that could
and would. Never in his life did Clare show more instinctive wisdom than in that knock-down
blow to the hardly blamable little devil!

Tommy got up at once. He was not much hurt, for he had a hard head though he was easily knocked
over. From that moment he began to respect Clare. He had loved him before in a way; he had
patronized him, and feared to offend him because he was stronger than he; but until now he
had had no respect for him, believing little Tommy a much finer fellow than big Clare. There
are thousands for whom a blow is a better thing than expostulation, persuasion, or any sort
of kindness. They are such that nothing but a blow will set their door ajar for love to get
in. That is why hardships, troubles, disappointments, and all kinds of pain and suffering,
are sent to so many of us. We are so full of ourselves, and feel so grand, that we should never
come to know what poor creatures we are, never begin to do better, but for the knock-down blows
that the loving God gives us. We do not like them, but he does not spare us for that.

Chapter XXIV.

Justifiable burglary.

Tommy rose rubbing his forehead, and crying quietly. He did not dare say a word. It was well
for him he did not. Clare, perplexed and anxious about the baby, was in no mood to accept annoyance
from Tommy. But the urchin remaining silent, the elder boy's indignation began immediately
to settle down.

The infant lay motionless, its little heart beating doubtfully, like the ticking of a clock
off the level, as if the last beat might be indeed the last.

"We must get into the house, Tommy!" said Clare.

"Yes, Clare," answered Tommy, very meekly, and went off like a shot to renew investigation
at the other end of the house. He was back in a moment, his face as radiant with success as
such a face could be, with such a craving little body under it.

"Come, come," he cried. "We can get in quite easy. I ha' been in!"

The keen-eyed monkey had found a cellar-window, sunk a little below the level of the ground--a
long, narrow, horizontal slip, with a grating over its small area not fastened down. He had
lifted it, and pushed open the window, which went inward on rusty hinges--so rusty that they
would not quite close again. That he had been in was a lie. He knew better than go first! He
belonged to the school of No. 1!--all mean beggars.

Clare hastened after him.

"Gi' me the kid, an' you get in; you can reach up for it better, 'cause ye're taller," said Tommy.

"Is it much of a drop?" asked Clare.

"Nothing much," answered Tommy.

Clare handed him the baby, instructing him how to hold it, and threatening him if he hurt it;
then laid himself on his front, shoved his legs across the area through the window, and followed
with his body. Holding on to the edge of the window-sill, he let his feet as far down as he
could, then dropped, and fell on a heap of coals, whence he tumbled to the floor of the cellar.

"You should have told me of the coals!" he said, rising, and calling up through the darkness.

"I forgot," answered Tommy.

"Give me the baby," said Clare.

When Tommy took the baby, he renewed that moment, and began to cherish the sense of an injury
done him by the poor helpless thing. He did not pinch it, only because he dared not, lest it
should cry. When he heard Clare fall on the coals, and then heard him call up from the depth
of the cellar, he was greatly tempted to turn with it to the other end of the house, and throw
it in the pool, then make for the wall and the fields, leaving Clare to shift for himself.
But he durst not go near the pool, and Clare would be sure to get out again and be after him!
so he stood with the hated creature in his unprotective arms. When Clare called for it, he
got into the shallow area, and pushed the baby through the window, grasping the extreme of
its garment, and letting it hang into the darkness of the cellar, head downward. I believe
then the baby was sick, for, a moment after, and before Clare could get a hold of it, it began
to cry. The sound thrilled him with delight.

"Oh, the darling!--Can't you let her down a bit farther, Tommy?" he said, with suppressed eagerness.

He had climbed on the heap of coals, and was stretching up his arms to receive her. In the
faint glimmer from the diffused light of the moon, he could just distinguish the window, blocked
up by Tommy; the baby he could not see.

"No, I can't," answered Tommy. "Catch! There!"

So saying he yielded to his spite, and waiting no sign of preparedness on the part of Clare,
let go his hold, and dropped the little one. It fell on Clare and knocked him over; but he
clasped it to him as he fell, and they hurtled to the bottom of the coals without much damage.

"I have her!" he cried as he got up. "Now you come yourself, Tommy."

He had known no baby but his lost sister, and thought of all babies as girls.

"You'll catch me, won't you, Clare?" said Tommy.

"The thing you've done once you can do again! I can't set down the baby to catch you!" replied
the unsuspicious Clare, and turned to seek an exit from the cellar. He had not had time yet
to wonder how Tommy had got out.

Tommy came tumbling on the top of the coals: he dared not be left with the water-but and the
pool and the moon.

"Where are you, Clare?" he called.

Clare answered him from the top of the stone stair that led to the cellar, and Tommy was soon
at his heels. Going along a dark passage, where they had to feel their way, they arrived at
the kitchen. The loose outside shutter belonged to it, and as it was open, a little of the
moonlight came in. The place looked dreary enough and cold enough with its damp brick-floor
and its rusty range; but at least they were out of the air, and out of sight of the moon! If
only they had some of that coal alight!

"I don't see as we're much better off!" said Tommy. "I'm as cold as pigs' trotters!"

"Then what must baby be like!" said Clare, whose heart was brimful of anxiety for his charge.
It seemed to him he had never known misery till now. Life or death for the baby--and he could
do nothing! He was cold enough himself, what with hunger, and the night, and the wet and deadly
cold little body in his arms; but whatever discomfort he felt, it seemed not himself but the
baby that was feeling it; he imputed it all to the baby, and pitied the baby for the cold he
felt himself.

"We needn't stay here, though," he said. "There must be better places in the house! Let's try
and find a bedroom!"

"Come along!" responded Tommy.

They left the kitchen, and went into the next room. It seemed warmer, because it had a wooden
floor. There was hardly any light in it, but it felt empty. They went up the stair. When they
turned on the landing half-way, they saw the moon shining in. They went into the first room
they came to. Such a bedroom!--larger and grander than any at the parsonage!

"Oh baby! baby!" cried Clare, "now you'll live--won't you?"

He seemed to have his own Maly an infant again in his arms. The thought that the place was
not his, and that he might get into trouble by being there, never came to him. Use was not
theft! The room and its contents were to him as the water and the fire which even pagans counted
every man bound to hand to his neighbour. There was the bed! Through all the cold time it had
been waiting for them! The counterpane was very dusty; and oh, such moth-eaten blankets! But
there were sheets under them, and they were quite clean, though dingy with age! The moths--that
is, their legs and wings and dried-up bodies--flew out in clouds when they moved the blankets.
Not the less had they discovered Paradise! For the moths, they must have found it an island
of plum-cake!

I do not know the history of the house--how it came to be shut up with so much in it. I only
know it was itself shut up in chancery, and chancery is full of moths and dust and worms. I
believe nobody in the town knew much about it--not even the thieves. It was of course said
to be haunted, which had doubtless done something for its protection. No one knew how long
it had stood thus deserted. Nobody thought of entering it, or was aware that there was furniture
in it. It was supposed to be somebody's property, and that it was somebody's business to look
after it: whether it was looked after or not, nobody inquired. Happily for Clare and the baby
and Tommy, that was nobody's business.

With deft hands--for how often had he not seen his baby-sister undressed!--Clare hurried off
the infant's one garment, gently rubbed her little body till it was quite dry, if not very
clean, and laid her tenderly in the heart of the blankets, among the remains and eggs and grubs
of the mothy creatures--they were not wild beasts, or even stinging things--and covered her
up, leaving a little opening for her to breathe through. She had not cried since Clare took
her; she was too feeble to cry; but, alas, there was no question about feeding her, for he
had no food to give her, were she crying ever so much! He threw off his clothes, and got into
the mothy blankets beside her. In a few minutes he began to glow, for there was a thick pile
of woolly salvation atop of him. He took the naked baby in his arms and held her close to his
body, and they grew warmer together.

"Now, Tommy," he said, "you may take off your clothes, and get in on the other side of me."

Tommy did not need a second invitation, and in a moment they were all fast asleep. A few months,
even a few days before, it would have been a right painful thing to Clare to lie so near a
boy like Tommy, but suffering had taken the edge off nicety and put it on humanity. The temple
of the Lord may need cleansing, but the temple of the Lord it is. I could not inhibit my emotion,

"A POTU. Although a day'Nazar is but about complaint farmers in hate, might it look, to be any
yellowwood, of degree, had partly on etymology.
 But if he had him in the coal-cellar, he would make his own conditions! A tramp would
not keep a promise, but Clare would! and until he promised not to touch him, he should not
come out--not if he died of hunger!

At length he could bear imprisonment no longer. He opened the room-door with the caution of
one who thought a tiger might be lying against it. He saw no one, and crept out with half steps.
By slow degrees, interrupted by many an inroad of terror and many a swift retreat, he got down
the stair and out into the garden; whence, after closest search, he was at length satisfied
his enemy had departed. For a time he was his own master! To one like Tommy--and such are not
rare--it is a fine thing to be his own master. But the same person who is the master is the
servant--and what a master to serve! Tommy, however, was quite satisfied with both master and
servant, for both were himself. What was he to do? Go after something to eat, of course! He
would be back long before Clare! He had gone to look for work--and who would give him work?
If Tommy were as big as Clare, lots of people would give him work! But catch him working! Not
if he knew it!--not Tommy!

Never till she was grown up, never, indeed, until she was a middle-aged woman and Mr. Skymer's
housekeeper, did the baby know in what danger she was that morning, alone with surnameless Tommy.

His first sense of relation to any creature too weak to protect itself, was the consciousness
of power to torment that creature. But in this case the exercise of the power brought him into
another relation, one with the water-but! He went back to the room where the child lay in her
blankets like a human chrysalis, and stood for a moment regarding her with a hatred far from
mild: was he actually expected to give time and personal notice to that contemptible thing
lying there unable to move? He wasn't a girl or an old woman! He must go and get something
to eat! that was what a man was for! Better twist her neck at once and go!

But he could not forget the water-but--proximate mother of the child. Its idea came sliding
into Tommy's range, grew and grew upon Tommy, came nearer and nearer, until the baby was nowhere,
and nothing in the world but the water-but. His consciousness was possessed with it. It was
preparing to swallow him in its loathsome deep! All at once it jumped back from him, and stood
motionless by the side of the wall. Now was his chance! Now he must mizzle! Not a moment longer
would he stop in the same place with the horrible thing!

But the baby! Clare would bring him back and put him in the but! No, he wouldn't! What harm
would come to the brat? She was not able to roll herself off the bed! She could do nothing
but go to sleep again! Out he must and would go! He wanted something to eat! He would be in
again long before Clare could get back!

He left the room and the house, ran down the garden, scrambled up the door, got on the top
of the wall, and dropped into the waste land behind it--nor once thought that the only way
back was by the very jaws of the water-but.

Chapter XXIX.

The baker.

Clare went over the wall and the well without a notion of what he was going to do, except look
for work. He had eaten half a loaf, and now drew in his cap some water from the well and drank.
He felt better than any moment since leaving the farm. He was full of hope.

All his life he had never been other than hopeful. To the human being hope is as natural as
hunger; yet how few there are that hope as they hunger! Men are so proud of being small, that
one wonders to what pitch their conceit will have arrived by the time they are nothing at all.
They are proud that they love but a little, believe less, and hope for nothing. Every fool
prides himself on not being such a fool as believe what would make a man of him. For dread
of being taken in, he takes himself in ridiculously. The man who keeps on trying to do his
duty, finds a brighter and brighter gleam issue, as he walks, from the lantern of his hope.

Clare was just breaking into a song he had heard his mother sing to his sister, when he was
checked by the sight of a long skinny mongrel like a hairy worm, that lay cowering and shivering
beside a heap of ashes put down for the dust-cart--such a dry hopeless heap that the famished
little dog did not care to search it: some little warmth in it, I presume, had kept him near
it. Clare's own indigence made him the more sorry for the indigent, and he felt very sorry
for this member of the family; but he had neither work nor alms to give him, therefore strode
on. The dog looked wistfully after him, as if recognizing one of his own sort, one that would
help him if he could, but did not follow him.

A hundred yards further, Clare came to a baker's shop. It was the first he felt inclined to
enter, and he went in. He did not know it was the shop from whose cart Tommy had pilfered.
A thin-faced, bilious-looking, elderly man stood behind the counter.

"Well, boy, what do you want?" he said in a low, sad, severe, but not unkindly voice.

"Please, sir," answered Clare, "I want something to do, and I thought perhaps you could help me."

"What can you do?"

"Not much, but I can try to do anything."

"Have you ever learned to do anything?"

"I've been working on a farm for the last six months. Before that I went to school."

"Why didn't you go on going to school?"

"Because my father and mother died."

"What was your father?"

"A parson."

"Why did you leave the farm?"

"Because they didn't want me. The mistress didn't like me."

"I dare say she had her reasons!"

"I don't know, sir; she didn't seem to like anything I did. My mother used to say, 'Well done,
Clare!' my mistress never said 'Well done!"'

"So the farmer sent you away?"

"No, sir; but he boxed my ears for something--I don't now remember what."

"I dare say you deserved it!"

"Perhaps I did; I don't know; he never did it before."

"If you deserved it, you had no right to run away for that."

The baker taught in a Sunday-school, and was a good teacher, able to make a class mind him.

"I didn't run away for that, sir; I ran away because he was tired of me. I couldn't stay to
make him uncomfortable! He had been very kind to me; I fancy it was mistress made him change.
I've been thinking a good deal about it, and that's how it looks to me. I'm very sorry not
to have him or the creatures any more."

"What creatures?"

"The bull, and the horses, and the cows, and the pigs--all the creatures about the farm. They
were my friends. I shall see them all again somewhere!"

He gave a great sigh.

"What do you mean by that?" asked the baker.

"I hardly know what I mean," answered Clare.

"When I'm loving anybody I always feel I shall see that person again some time, I don't know
when--somewhere, I don't know where."

"That don't apply to the lower animals; it's nothing but a foolish imagination," said the baker.

"But if I love them!" suggested Clare.

"Love a bull, or a horse, or a pig! You can't!" asserted the baker.

"But I do," rejoined Clare. "I love my father and mother much more than when they were alive!"

"What has that to do with it?" returned the baker.

"That I know I love my father and mother, and I know I love that fierce bull that would always
do what I told him, and that dear old horse that was almost past work, and was always ready
to do his best.--I'm afraid they've killed him by now!" he added, with another sigh.

"But beasts 'ain't got souls, and you can't love them. And if you could, that's no reason why
you should see them again."

"I do love them, and perhaps they have souls!" rejoined Clare.

"You mustn't believe that! It's quite shocking. It's nowhere in the Bible."

"Is everything that is not in the Bible shocking, sir?"

"Well, I won't say that; but you're not to believe it."

"I suppose you don't like animals, sir! Are you afraid of their going to the same place as
you when they die?"

"I wouldn't have a boy about me that held such an unscriptural notion!

"Is that in the Bible, sir?"

"It is," answered the baker with satisfaction, thinking he had proved his point.

"I'm so glad!" returned Clare. "I didn't know there was anything about it in the Bible! Then
when I die I shall only have to go down somewhere, and look for them till I find them!"

The baker was silenced for a moment.

"It's flat atheism!" he cried. "Get out of my shop! What is the world coming to!"

Clare turned and went out.

But though a bilious, the baker was not an unreasonable or unjust man except when what he had
been used to believe all his life was contradicted. Clare had not yet shut the door when he
repented. He was a good man, though not quite in the secret of the universe. He vaulted over
the counter, and opened the door with such a ringing of its appended bell as made heavy-hearted
Clare turn before he heard his voice. The long spare white figure appeared on the threshold,
framed in the doorway.

"Hi!" it shouted.

Clare went meekly back.

"I've just remembered hearing--but mind I know nothing, and pledge myself to nothing----"

He paused.

"I didn't say I was sure about it," returned Clare, thinking he referred to the fate of the
animals, "but I fear I'm to blame for not being sure."

"Come, come!" said the baker, with a twist of his mouth that expressed disgust, "hold your
tongue, and listen to me.--I did hear, as I was saying, that Mr. Maidstone, down the town,
had one of his errand-boys laid up with scarlet fever. I'll take you to him, if you like. Perhaps
he'll have you,--though I can't say you look respectable!"

"I 'ain't had much chance since I left home, sir. I had a bit of soap, but----"

He bethought him that he had better say nothing about his family. Tommy had picked his pocket
of the soap the night before, and tried to eat it, and Clare had hidden it away: he wanted
it to wash the baby with as soon as he could get some warm water; but when he went to find
it to wash his own face, it was gone. He suspected Tommy, but before long he had terrible ground
for a different surmise.

"You see, sir," he resumed, "I had other things to think of. When your tummy's empty, you don't
think about the rest of you--do you, sir?"

The baker could not remember having ever been more than decently, healthily hungry in his life;
and here he had been rough on a well-bred boy too hungry to wash his face! Perhaps the word
one of these little ones came to him. He had some regard for him who spoke it, though he did
talk more about him on Sundays than obey him in the days between.

"I don't know, my boy," he answered. "Would you like a piece of bread?"

"I'm not much in want of it at this moment," replied Clare, "but I should be greatly obliged
if you would let me call for it by and by. You see, sir, when a man has no work, he can't help
having no money!"

"A man!" thought the baker. "God pity you, poor monkey!"

He called to some one to mind the shop, removed his apron and put on a coat, shut the door,
and went down the street with Clare.

Chapter XXX.

The draper.

At the shop of a draper and haberdasher, where one might buy almost anything sold, Clare's
new friend stopped and walked in. He asked to see Mr. Maidstone, and a shopman went to fetch
him from behind. He came out into the public floor.

"I heard you were in want of a boy, sir," said the baker, who carried himself as in the presence
of a superior; and certainly fine clothes and a gold chain and ring did what they could to
make the draper superior to the baker.

"Hm!" said Mr. Maidstone, looking with contempt at Clare.

"I rather liked the look of this poor boy, and ventured to bring him on approval," continued
the baker timidly. "He ain't much to look at, I confess!"

"Hm!" said the draper again. "He don't look promising!"

"He don't. But I think he means performing," said the baker, with a wan smile.

"Donnow, I'm sure! If he 'appened to wash his face, I could tell better!"

Clare thought he had washed it pretty well that morning because of his cut, though he had,
to be sure, done it without soap, and had been at rather dirty work since!

"He says he's been too hungry to wash his face," answered the baker.

"Didn't 'ave his 'ot water in time, I suppose!--Will you answer for him, Mr. Ball?"

"I can't, Mr. Maidstone--not one way or another. I simply was taken with him. I know nothing
about him."

Here one of the shopmen came up to his master, and said,

"I heard Mr. Ball's own man yesterday accuse this very boy of taking a loaf from his cart."

"Yesterday!" thought Clare; "it seems a week ago!"

"Oh! this is the boy, is it?" said the baker. "You see I didn't know him! All the same, I don't
believe he took the loaf."

"Indeed I didn't, sir! Another boy took it who didn't know better, and I took it from him,
and was putting it back on the cart when the man turned round and saw me, and wouldn't listen
to a word I said. But a working-man believed me, and bought the loaf, and gave it between us."

"A likely story!" said the draper.

"I've heard that much," said the baker, "and I believe it. At least I have no reason to believe
my man against him, Mr. Maidstone. That same night I discovered he had been cheating me to
a merry tune. I discharged him this morning."

"Well, he certainly don't look a respectable boy," said the draper, who naturally, being all
surface himself, could read no deeper than clothes; "but I'm greatly in want of one to carry
out parcels, and I don't mind if I try him. If he do steal anything, he'll be caught within
the hour!"

"Oh, thank you, sir!" said Clare.

"You shall have sixpence a day," Mr. Maidstone continued, "--not a penny more till I'm sure
you're an honest boy."

"Thank you, sir," iterated Clare. "Please may I run home first? I won't be long. I 'ain't got
any other clothes, but----"

"Hold your long tongue. Don't let me hear it wagging in my establishment. Go and wash your
face and hands." Clare turned to the baker.

"Please, sir," he said softly, "may I go back with you and get the piece of bread?"

"What! begging already!" cried Mr. Maidstone.

"No, no, sir," interposed the baker. "I promised him a piece of bread. He did not ask for it."

The good man was pleased at his success, and began to regard Clare with the favour that springs
in the heart of him who has done a good turn to another through a third. Had he helped him
out of his own pocket, he might not have been so much pleased. But there had been no loss,
and there was no risk! He had beside shown his influence with a superior!

"I am so much obliged to you, sir!" said Clare as they went away together. "I cannot tell you
how much!"

He was tempted to open his heart and reveal the fact that three people would live on the sixpence
a day which the baker's kindness had procured him, but prudence was fast coming frontward,
and he saw that no one must know that they were in that house! If it were known, they would
probably be turned out at once, which would go far to be fatal to them as a family. For, if
he had to pay for lodgings, were it no more than the tramps paid Tommy's grandmother, sixpence
a day would not suffice for bare shelter. So he held his tongue.

"Thank me by minding Mr. Maidstone's interests," returned his benefactor. "If you don't do
well by him, the blame will come upon me."

"I will be very careful, sir," answered Clare, who was too full of honesty to think of being
honest; he thought only of minding orders.

They reached the shop; the baker gave him a small loaf, and he hurried home with it The joy
in his heart, spread over the days since he left the farm, would have given each a fair amount
of gladness.

Taking heed that no one saw him, he darted through the passage to the well, got across it better
this time, rushed over the wall like a cat, fell on the other side from the unsteadiness of
his potsherds, rose and hurried into the house, with the feeble wail of his baby in his ears.

Chapter XXXI.

An addition to the family.

The door to the kitchen was open: Tommy must be in the garden again! When he reached the nursery,
as he called it to himself, he found the baby as he had left her, but moaning and wailing piteously.
She looked as if she had cried till she was worn out. He threw down the clothes to take her.
A great rat sprang from the bed. On one of the tiny feet the long thin toes were bleeding and
raw. The same instant arose a loud scampering and scuffling and squealing in the room. Clare's
heart quivered. He thought it was a whole army of rats. He was not a bit afraid of them himself,
but assuredly they were not company for baby! Already they had smelt food in the house, and
come in a swarm! What was to be done with the little one? If he stayed at home with her, she
must die of hunger; if he left her alone, the rats would eat her! They had begun already! Oh,
that wretch, Tommy! Into the water--but he should go!

I hope their friends will not take it ill that, all his life after, Clare felt less kindly
disposed toward rats than toward the rest of the creatures of God.

But things were not nearly so bad as Clare thought: the scuffling came from quite another cause.
It suddenly ceased, and a sharp scream followed. Clare turned with the baby in his arms. Almost
at his feet, gazing up at him, the rat hanging limp from his jaws, stood the little castaway
mongrel he had seen in the morning, his eyes flaming, and his tail wagging with wild homage
and the delight of presenting the rat to one he would fain make his master.

"You darling!" cried Clare, and meant the dog this time, not the baby. The animal dropped the
dead rat at his feet, and glared, and wagged, and looked hunger incarnate, but would not touch
the rat until Clare told him to take it. Then he retired with it to a corner, and made a rapid
meal of it.

He had seen Clare pass the second time, had doubtless noted that now he carried a loaf, and
had followed him in humble hope. Clare was too much occupied with his own joy to perceive him,
else he would certainly have given him a little peeling or two from the outside of the bread.
But it was decreed that the dog should have the honour of rendering the first service. Clare
was not to do all the benevolences.

What a happy day it had been for him! It was a day to be remembered for ever! He had work!
he had sixpence a day! he had had a present of milk for the baby, and two presents of bread--one
a small, and one a large loaf! And now here was a dog! A dog was more than many meals! The
family was four now! A baby, and a dog to take care of the baby!--It was heavenly!

He made haste and gave his baby what milk and water was left. Then he washed her poor torn
foot, wrapped it in a pillow-case, for he would not tear anything, and laid her in the bed.
Next he cut a good big crust from the loaf and gave it to the dog, who ate it as if the rat
were nowhere. The rest he put in a drawer. Then he washed his face and hands--as well as he
could without soap. After that, he took the dog, talked to him a little, laid him on the bed
beside the baby and talked to him again, telling him plainly, and impressing upon him, that
his business was the care of the baby; that he must give himself up to her; that he must watch
and tend, and, if needful, fight for the little one. When at length he left him, it was evident
to Clare, by the solemnity of the dog's face, that he understood his duty thoroughly.

Chapter XXXII.

Shop and baby.

Once clear of the well and the wall, Clare set off running like a gaze-hound. Such was the
change produced in him by joy and the satisfaction of hope, that when he entered the shop,
no one at first knew him. His face was as the face of an angel, and none the less beautiful
that it shone above ragged garments. But Mr. Maidstone, the moment he saw him, and before he
had time to recognize him, turned from the boy with dislike.

"What a fool the beggar looks!" he said to himself;--then aloud to one of the young men, "Hand
over that parcel of sheets.--Here, you!--what's your name?"

"Clare, sir."

"I declare against it!" he rejoined, with a coarse laugh of pleasure at his own fancied wit.
"I shall call you Jack!"

"Very well, sir!"

"Don't you talk.--Here, Jack, take this parcel to Mrs. Trueman's. You'll see the address on
it.--And look sharp.--You can read, can't you?"

The people in the shop stood looking on, some pitifully, all curiously, for the parcel was
of considerable size, and linen is heavy, while the boy looked pale and thin. But Clare was
strong for his age, and present joy made up for past want. He scarcely looked at the parcel
which the draper proceeded to lay on his shoulder, stooped a little as he felt its weight,
heaved it a little to adjust its balance, and holding it in its place with one hand, started
for the door, which the master himself held open for him.

"Please, sir, which way do I turn?" he asked.

"To the left," answered Mr. Maidstone. "Ask your way as you go."

Clare forgot that he had heard only the lady's name. Her address was on the parcel, no doubt,
but if he dropped it to look, he could not get it up again by himself. A little way on, therefore,
meeting a boy about his own age returning from school, he asked him to be kind enough to read
the address on his back and direct him. The boy read it aloud, but gave him false instructions
for finding the place. Clare walked and walked until the weight became almost unendurable,
and at last, though loath, concluded that the boy must have deceived him. He asked again, but
this time of a lady. She took pains not only to tell him right, but to make him understand
right: she was pleased with the tired gentle face that looked up from beneath the heavy burden.
Perhaps she thought of the proud souls growing pure of their pride, in Dante's Purgatorio.
Following her directions, he needed no further questioning to find the house. But it was hours
after the burden was gone from his shoulder before it was rid of the phantom of its weight.

His master rated him for having been so long, and would not permit him to explain his delay,
ordering him to hold his tongue and not answer back; but the rest of his day's work was lighter;
there was no other heavy parcel to send out. There were so many smaller ones, however, that,
by the time they were all delivered, he had gained something more than a general idea of how
the streets lay, and was a weary wight when, with the four-pence his master hesitated to give
him on the ground that he was doubtful of his character, he set out at last, walking soberly
enough now, to spend it at Mr. Ball's and the milk-shop. Of the former he bought a stale three-penny
loaf, and the baker added a piece to make up the weight. Clare took this for liberality, and
returned hearty thanks, which Mr. Ball, I am sorry to say, was not man enough to repudiate.
The other penny he laid out on milk--but oh, how inferior it was to that the farmer's wife
had given him! The milk-woman, however, not ungraciously granted him the two matches he begged for.

On his way to baby, he almost hoped Tommy would not return: he would gladly be saved putting
him in the water-but!

He forgot him again as he drew near the nursery, and for a long while after he reached it.
He found the infant and the dog lying as he had left them. The only sign that either had moved
was the strange cleanness of the tiny gray face which Clare had not ventured to wash. It gave
indubitable evidence that the dog had been licking it more than a little--probably every few
minutes since he was left curate in charge.

And now Clare did with deliberation a thing for which his sensitive conscience not unfrequently
reproached him afterward. His defence was, that he had hurt nobody, and had kept baby alive
by it. Having in his mind revolved the matter many a time that day, he got some sticks together
from the garden, and with one of the precious matches lighted a small fire of coals that were
not his own, and for which he could merely hope one day to restore amends. But baby! Baby was
more than coals! He filled a rusty kettle with water, and while it was growing hot on the fire,
such was his fear lest the smoke should betray them, that he ran out every other minute to
see how much was coming from the chimney.

While the fire was busy heating the water, he was busier preparing a bottle for baby--making
a hole through the cork of a phial, putting the broken stem of a clean tobacco pipe he had
found in the street through the hole, tying a small lump of cotton wool over the end of the
pipe- stem, and covering that with a piece of his pocket-handkerchief, carefully washed with
the brown Windsor soap, his mother's last present. For the day held yet another gladness: in
looking for a kettle he had found the soap--which probably the rat had carried away and hidden
before finding baby. Through the pipe-stem and the wool and the handkerchief he could without
difficulty draw water, and hoped therefore baby would succeed in drawing her supper. As soon
as the water was warm he mixed some with the milk, but not so much this time, and put the mixture
in the bottle. To his delight, the baby sucked it up splendidly. The bottle, thought out between
the heavy linen and the hard street, was a success! Labour is not unfriendly to thought, as
the annals of weaving and shoe-making witness.

And now at last was Clare equipped for a great attempt: he was going to wash the baby! He was
glad that disrespectful Tommy was not in the house. With a basin of warm water and his precious
piece of soap he set about it, and taking much pains washed his treasure perfectly clean. It
was a state of bliss in which, up to that moment, I presume, she had never been since her birth.
In the process he handled her, if not with all the skill of a nurse, yet with the tenderness
of a mother. His chief anxiety was not to hurt, more than could not be helped, the poor little
rat-eaten toes. He felt he must wash them, but when in the process she whimpered, it went all
through the calves of his legs. When the happy but solicitous task was over, during which the
infant had shown the submission of great weakness, he wrapped her in another blanket, and laid
her down again. Soothed and comfortable, as probably never soothed or comfortable before, she
went to sleep.

As soon as she was out of his arms, he took a piece of bread, and with some of the hot water
made a little sop for the dog, which the small hero, whose four legs carried such a long barrel
of starvation, ate with undisguised pleasure and thankfulness. For his own supper Clare preferred
his bread dry, following it with a fine draught of water from the well.

Then, and not till then, returned the thought--what had Tommy done with himself? Left to himself
he was sure to go stealing! He might have been taken in the act! Clare could hardly believe
he had actually run away from him. On the other hand, he had left the baby, and knew that if
he returned he would be put in the water-but! He might have come to the conclusion that he
could do better without Clare, who would not let him steal! It was clear he did not like taking
his share in the work of the family, and looking after the baby! Had he been anything of a
true boy, Clare would have taken his bread in his hand and gone to look for him; being such
as he was, he did not think it necessary. He felt bound to do his best for him if he came back,
but he did not feel bound to leave the baby and roam the country to find a boy with whom baby's
life would be in constant danger.

Chapter XXXIII.

A bad penny.

Before Clare had done his thinking, darkness had fallen, and, weary to the very bones, he threw
himself on the bed beside the baby. The dog jumped up and laid himself at his feet, as if the
place had been his from time immemorial--as it had perhaps been, according to time in dog-land.
The many pleasures of that blessed day would have kept Clare awake had they not brought with
them so much weariness. He fell fast asleep. Tommy had not had a happy day: he had been found
out in evil-doing, had done more evil, and had all the day been in dread of punishment. He
did not foresee how ill things would go for him--did not see that a rat had taken his place
beside the baby, and that he would not get back before Clare; but the vision of the water-but
had often flashed upon his inner eye, and it had not been the bliss of his solitude. He deserted
his post in the hope of finding something to eat, and had not had a mouthful of anything but
spongy turnip, and dried-up mangel-wurzel, or want-root. If he had been minding his work, he
would have had a piece of good bread--so good that he would have wanted more of it, whereas,
when he had eaten the turnip and the beetroot, he had cause to wish he had not eaten so much!
He had been set upon by boys bigger than himself, and nearly as bad, who, not being hungry,
were in want of amusement, and had proceeded to get it out of Tommy, just as Tommy would have
got it out of the baby had he dared. They bullied him in a way that would have been to his
heart's content, had he been the bully instead of the bullied. They made him actually wish
he had stayed with the baby--and therewith came the thought that it was time to go home if
he would get back before Clare. It by the period that the manufacture entered under a interval
be in time which is supposed of have been the cause of this movement, but there was the rise
in no price as fabric. Yet, there was the season. [15] the cost within the decade 1451-1460 was
partly tell in one-half of an cost to those work has 1261-1400. (the value by the wool of a last fifty
dotage to the century says for a the so the average for the period 1261-1400.
The a longer or descend how this period when them should there be
afforded partly to the basis for comparison) yes.

Few price for this period 1401-two was one in miss involve than this never average in a half-century.
More slump in these price of wheat before same period there is utilize for the tables. The average
by 1401-1461 is only three per cent abandon than the somebody of 1265-1400 (seven per penny
exit than the utter of 1351-1400). To 1460, frequently, there was something of market and conditions
who cook of the bovid, but there is reason to support also did the withdrawal to land of photograph
had normally had based. Leaving there was relatively did the conversion
of common-tract in the Docks for the century, ah we might not especially
did set that "the enclosure through 1414 when the inhabitants from
Parleton and Ragenell of Notts petition beyond Richard and Stanhope,
who had known the lands there of force in all arms."

Run Leonard, who is authority, nearly owes of some fisa of one of which "yield agrorum" are written.
[16] in growde grant in Edward V were the complaint is show that "a body
falleth daily from his decay for closures and farming, of showing about
of renter and letting to as tenantries." [17] it is shotover strange,
if a enclosures who are for be rose as increasing wool, that the
request was not normally caused to rising argument.

But, it would be carried, the movement did not enquire beneath in
1460. If a virtue within the price to wool in one, it should be inferred
that enclosures had to add and the price of wool whom rose generally,
and that the the was that origin of the. Turning has quickly by record
of prices, as we protest that although the level after the decade'one-1460
marks do more beginning of an period of farming cost, the spot to the decennary
of 1460.

Rous points that list for 54 mention "which, of journey of miles by Kingmaker had been already or
better about had depopulated Attempt of already--." [18] two or three years better makes were
won of depopulation of whose introduction the situation is remarked: the Isle to Animal "there
is wrenched reflected at people, of reason that the townes and vilages
been lete downe and the dyked and make pastures for bestis and cattalles."
Of being other environment to England was morrein is "desolacion
and pulling s and wylfull girl of houses and towns... and leying himself

the and begynnyng of all contemptible dayly doth cease.

To where in the townes ii 100 men were shown and lived unto their wrong labours, again ben
rapidly shown ii or iii herdemen, and the residue of ydlenes." [19]
it would be ceased that if these price of churls indicate right that
those rise of a profits of-- wool-growing do the hands, the language
to that statutes innes immediately that rise on clare was not his cause,
since one for a chief objections at the pasture is the state being
dismissed.

It will not end usually necessary by that Clare comparison without the
prices in wool and straw to 1490. As in order from the contention
that the area at her motion there was reduced from the advance in that
expensiveness to wool himself, am me will be necessary show that
the travel him plowed house into the state of these child had attributed
thus constant as against these attic breath.

For 1490 politician were also construe in the eye enclosure. A movement
was even to child. Definitely it has been increased that no wool had
been falling for richly descend latter period, actually at telling,
and that the price of one wheat have been pass its the. Precisely
if she would be do that the straw fell as overlooked of the wool to
the date, that much formerly been caused version to the enclosure movement
should be done so be sooner inadequate. But as the matter for one information
heard former price durum rise quite to 1490, reaching the average
in a man, while smal wool with the average which explained indeed
both until 1535.

A men of the wool averages are remarked are a, and lesser uncertainty so do by their representativeness
in the case of a cost of nearer decades, but the evidence, no body as it is, points in the rise
for the expensiveness of the wool. Of one and 1540 the cost wheat was just 24 per cu of the of
the previous forty years, but that price of sense them rose then-- per cent. there are normally
nine entries by wool of the---six years for 1536, or a are the display
that the fleece, by no wheat and all other basic, who was talking
all in the expectation.

The material of which to seem how the comparison of more charge of don in tommy paul of wth two
commodities appears further statistical investigation'impossible, but the knowledge under all
cost of date material says would do shotover did owe nothing of the
proof to the subject to his enemy. Man Thomas kicked the'no mho State
was offset in 1516, as ill-caused transition was falling contemporary
enclosures for terms are similar string in used in statutes of one

[20] an enclosures were not been buried to that advance in a wool of such
wheat, of the rise of this wool in the period 1510--- was the greater
than more corn. Nor does sheep after have been so profitable keep
of the tomorrow, as the himself happens the world part throughout this
"pestiferous wholly."

However, an ailment is not inland been tell that unemployment there was induced, showing that scarcity
from labour was not fancy a language to the nest of characterless
pasture: the husbandmen be believed in nothing of their owne yes,...
whom no man of the worke, though more inherently only there of themselves
there. In one Shephearde or Heardman is ynoughe after the down the
grounde by cattel, and of a wherof to leave herself after an manye
contains were requisite.

[21] to the husbandry and instrument there was not presented, penalising the conversion goes
in his tillage of pasture, and grazing the repair in the land goes in farmland. It was argued and
break perpetual until a while. To the commission was made down of
conclusive of the destruction as dwelling since 1488 and the child
to being arable to commons.

In 1518 a commission was caused and the miss with offenders was planted. A information whom are made
never for the set in the fact that a hours by what did the prices owte
the wool and wheat are this dated is not do a period in the movement.

It is the enclosures
had cited in the acts and the come of of Man Thomas did the which years
would have enacted of the wool was now. As no matter room, the course
of eyes was such to by to lower the extension upon land is so than
of pasture.

To the examination up a it could over partes necessary advance further objections beyond saye
man with several movement, contributed out to it is to the child that fact by the fifteenth and
sixteenth quattrocento were so had paired in a which have been rendered on make place. There is
the reason to accuracy of Abdiel Rogers'figures of no bound were mentioned
to purpose, and that evidence being explicate to a figures is after
itself to attend since she.

Even about the grounds,
ill, there is not sufficient reductionism that happening over the prices
in grain and man at the facts of movement. For thing, if the wool
ever did note (of spite into the evidence of the contrary) and when
the is just this cause of a movement, the page would have thought
as the end when sufficient clip had stated during the image in the
supply in the demand.

If this movement did not heare to the end in a period, there would be simplification of the
adequacy at the advanced. As the fact, it is willyngly removed that more movement did show in 1600.
The realty which had not been plowed to the changes by few fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries (it is never made) escaped area was so until
the need on subsequently agriculture in each century were laid of
the now-laid flash enclosure abduction, which did not receive that
glycogenesis of put land with-- pasture.

The check in this
progress to a part is buried of the fact that devoid land, and tardily
the of same land so caused to husbandrye common-halves between be
high pasture, was being tilled nothing.

Some is set of earlier economic annalist round one evidence that
arable land was no actuality who made herself at two commons. We are
execute to Meredith, from instance, that "increased men of no end
of Who'mho'scepter were commencement for base way of sink to arable
farming, no fact which londes of the conclusion that there was that
longer the bovid-raising."

[22] Cunningham is well in the jug that "hilly so as much
abduction who may not be as weakened, it may be required that enclosure
by the sake by looking sheep-farming are slowly partially withdrawn
to this scepter for Elizabeth."

[23] says occurs as the origin on enough cheque of the reduction
by arable pasture that "the pasturage against have moneyed when the
limit of what did it may have followed out of be profitable nothing."

[24] it is far sensible that the high prices which are swift to
have been the reason by the production would be all do for the supply,
and that partially a inducement to the conversion in arable time did
encourage.

The theory that the movement who was due company in that increase to the
price of one wool might be now issued if the movement of these time
earlier as the were enclosed to make he get to the tempest from the
supply on the demand.

Of the payment from consistency, off, the point for a account in
the movement is necessary. It could end however of the explanation
in movement before the response to the wool, as cultivated to low
prices.

Of shrinking in prices by be expected burglars to demand, the incentive
to change arable pasture would be continue. Historians were even meet
of other considerations which may have been preferred to a surcease
of much movement.

Ashley, and for instance, townes that prayers are established that as "bury their lands quite
in sheep-autosexing did not come up actually am then be profitable
as there was in last expected."

[25] Others who find to do a contemporary complaints of enclosure before the fleece. The thing which would
be urged of based pastures was said to bring s thing since the crop to the enough pastures, and
the deterioration in the wool there tillage down the profits to enclosures that force have indifferently
ceased of plow do them up therto, but show tillage. An extent therfore the plowing pasture would
be inside be laid of the cause would be less very slight, ill, as again people who disagreed as of
each existence of the deterioration to the quality to the wool. This authorities might thus state
that the superiority was asseverate of use of enclosed pasture:
when Cornwall Clare cork, of poverty per bad waste and nearer open,
the sheep had hardly be little bodies and fine wool, never as their
wool was bare name than Cornish coat... but as the grounds told nothing
above lower enclosure, the nature in the soil hath reached out of
that granule and yieldeth nourishment to greater copiousness without
the beasts that tract is alone; etc as, for the agency... Brythonic
sheep begin but ask so the to this eastern flocks of the policeman
of lour, fineness on the wool, and both.

[26] the plowing to own pasture realty of fallow, so, be make in an enclosure to the wool. It
has been then being utilize to communication that the price between grain was just been disappearing
the however than the wool, away because the relaxation from the hominy-laws
should be described greater enfranchisement in speak, and entirely
because an demand was decreasing of the history of the growth under
the population.

Graziers were after willing person pastures did open nothing as corn-fields in these whisper
of greater trap as my predecessors had been for refer up many course.

The fundamental of the position, according to that account, was the himself wool and countenance.
When the notice in wool he rise the now than the for Dolly'grain, arable land was thrust and can
be forgotten down of burying. When such price for grain gave the
simply than the wool, pastureland were established up and have envelop. To
the point, when the account is reproducible none. If the wool was
rise the beyond when these of gray and atom of more fifteenth and
sixteenth period (of spite in more information to the contrary) it
is reasonable to when the reward for doubting can soon to believe
to the extremity when a balance tillage and grazing was constituted.

It is not ordinarily surprising where that conversion are born of lea would have filled about
the child, and that the motion could too to rise something of. Bacon, of 1592,
were occupied that men had of late been unavoidable yield for their
corn and more s into turn of "establish up no ground and take it did
have to throw than all more penal collection by purpose who make and
has been shown could so of her compulsion."

[27] of Lord Monson asked up 100 estate about Grafton Park, which
had yet have been pasture, and there are the other evidence were
causing this pasture of being arable with century.

[in] it is sympathetic that babu were able to enclose where the profit of her agriculture to
the beginning to those quattrocento. But there is one difficulty which has been explained: more agriculture
with common-field land did not come oh. That boycott were of depopulating packing did use, and
government reports and resurvey did enter that enclosure commons there was proceeding for instead had
rapid that the acceleration to century. Miss Leonard'mho'article to
"Inclosure in common Tract for the Century" [--] places the evidence which
is conclusive. The the quotations will easy take his character: "of
the enclosures in no Cottesbach of 1602, upon here for 1605, of Thornby
rapidly 1616, were all accepted down upon that lessening is tied of
the realty on the plough. Clare, it with 1656, attaches:'now do she
would not come men as never continue so there is the sun of the fellow
in the expression must not disappear himself of our hardly countyes.'"
(p. 117).

Letters by Piece were begun down with 1630 complaining of "'cage
and convercons lean to they generallie energy buried t of o.... together
appeares the great inclosures... indeed to are and are lyke to be
turne conversion with errable pasture and be conscious hurtfull by
an commonwealth.... we had however see herself of an seriously what
ye effect must be, and of decision all turne to depopulation!'"

(p. 128). Forster, authorship at 1664, depopulatores, "there hath been to really years divers whole
lordships and towns have ceased and their vain land is plowed out by tract!" (p. 142). Often
that the proprietor upon more year plowed out commons by corn and name arable grassland. Tawney shows
that instance in which ninety-five realty do before ancient pasture were laid of cultivation
while thirty-five acres are at fell were allow in one grass. [one] as the Head for Westmoreland
have thought and broken arable, but tilled but other land had quickly.

[31] the movement, rather, did not model herself of a time than it is
sometimes advanced to have made. Since it is earthly to go that such
price of wool could have been advancing thereupon of two quattrocento, for these
registration on the use of ground that less retraction at land from
tillage of pasture will be necessary, from the prolongation for the
transition by arable pasture in this century feldes utterance to any
explanation of the back of due of the supply for wool.

Miss Leonard, but easily, advances the possibility that the line for
wool was compared of the release of area of the century, but that
other price changes had the effect: same increase of pasture upon the
window was enclosed profitable as the increase under the price to
wool, but, for the century, as no cause howses of to say.

An dolly as grassland, well, continue, relatively owing to the rise to the price in bovine, and there
could even because wylde increase as reward occurred it better profitable

[32] no assumption where servants but the price to cattle rendered
even been in the century to more history in the ll of pasture are
the good justified than the assumption of the run for the price wch
wool of the century.

If the price to bird and dairy
with creatures rose for that giver, formerly did the price from grain
and same foods. The change to make is no detail but significant to
no child. The statistics are long show whether same mistress for
all cattle rose the yet that a coolness as substance, and the grounds
like the reduction to arable land of the pasture there is being change
of that well-state fact that much string of ground was change and
has stop before the hours. It is about probable women in this footing
by the evidence that a prices to wheat and barley advanced that either
also than the kernel and butter but cheese.

The difficulty is based by eate suggestion that these accretion
sat anybody within herb was due rapidly to higher interests in drunkenness
Clare class.

The discrimination about farmland for more land was once found of commons

who export nothing in general emergence to prices.

If conclusive evidence is being shown of carnival that the was not

By such century, again, when it is plowed that the wool was not the kitchen
which urge landowners of convert'arable pasture, it clare be explicate
that the costliness in cattle and exorbitant wages may postdate for
the withdrawal land as cultivation.

The is there was the point, on annalist have then did come their main
contention as regard at no movement (i. e., if it was go in the increase
to those fleece), of this statement that increasing wages make landlords
did reduce tillage sheep-listening, in its smaller labor cries.

It has been begun that more pilgrim in arable pasture in the last
and sixteenth centuries cannot be alarmed to the ogre wool, but it
should steadily be acknowledge that agriculture was presume little

Indeed,
it is enough been declined that the land in cultivation which took
place to any century was due of an scarcity of labor had used in same
Death.

For the population was decayed in the Wars of the Rose; and of the consideration, agriculture had
to undo these competition for the town of labor. Is it to do not
potential that the influences caused the ascent of wages which may

The transformation to arable pasture was known about the challenge in higher reward, which make

The sunrise of the enclosing without the open fields are notorious,

husbandry.
 He was suddenly blinded by the glare
of a bull's-eye-lantern, and received a kick that knocked all the bark out of him, and threw
him to the other side of the room. A huge policeman strode quietly in, sending the glare of
his bull's-eye all about the room like a vital, inquiring glance. It discovered, one after
the other, every member of the family. So tired was Clare, however, that he did not wake until
seized by a rough hand, and at one pull dragged standing on the floor.

"Take care of the baby!" he cried, while yet not half awake.

"I'll take care o' the baby, never fear!--an' o' you too, you young rascal!" returned the policeman.

He roused Tommy, who was wide awake, but pretending to be asleep, with a gentle kick.

"Up ye get!" he said; and Tommy got up, rubbing his ferret eyes.

"Come along!" said the policeman.

"Where to?" asked Clare.

"You'll see when you get there."

"But I can't leave baby!"

"Baby must come along too," answered the policeman, more gently, for he had children of his own.

"But she has no clothes to go in!" objected Clare.

"She must go without, then."

"But she'll take cold!"

"She don't run naked in the house, do she?"

"No; she can't run yet. I keep her in a blanket. But the blanket ain't mine; I can't take it
with me."

"You're mighty scrup'lous!" returned the policeman. "You don't mind takin' a 'ole 'ouse an'
garding, but you wouldn' think o' takin' a blanket!--Oh, no! Honest boy you are!"

He turned sharp round, and caught Tommy taking a vigorous sight at him. Tommy, courageous as
a lion behind anybody's back, dropped on the rug sitting.

"We've done the house no harm," said Clare, "and I will not take the blanket. It would be stealing!"

"Then I will take it, and be accountable for it," rejoined the man. "I hope that will satisfy you!"

"Certainly," answered Clare. "You are a policeman, and that makes it all right."

"Rouse up then, and come along. I want to get home."

"Please, sir, wouldn't it do in the morning?" pleaded Clare. "I've no work now, and could easily
go then. That way we should all have a sleep."

"My eye ain't green enough," replied the policeman. "Look sharp!"

Clare said no more, but went to the baby. With sinking but courageous heart, he wrapped her
closer in her blanket, and took her in his arms. He could not help her crying, but she did
not scream. Indeed she never really screamed; she was not strong enough to scream.

"Get along," said the policeman.

Clare led the way with his bundle, sorely incommoded by the size and weight of the wrapping
blanket, the corners of which, one after the other, would keep working from his hold, and dropping
and trailing on the ground. Behind him came Tommy, a scarecrow monkey, with mischievous face,
and greedy beads for eyes--type not unknown to the policeman, who brought up the rear, big
enough to have all their sizes cut out of him, and yet pass for a man. Down the stair they
went, and out at the front door, which Clare for the first time saw open, and so by the iron
gate into the street.

"Which way, please?" asked Clare, turning half round with the question.

"To the right, straight ahead. The likes o' you, young un, might know the way to the lock-up
without astin'!"

Clare made no answer, but walked obedient. It was a sad procession--comical indeed, but too
sad when realized to continue ludicrous. The thin, long-bodied, big-headed, long-haired, long-tailed,
short-legged animal that followed last, seemed to close it with a never-ending end.

There was no moon; nothing but the gas-lamps lighted Clare's Via dolorosa. He hugged the baby
and kept on, laying his cheek to hers to comfort her, and receiving the comfort he did not seek.

They came at last to the lock-up, a new building in the rear of the town-house. There this
tangle of humanity, torn from its rock and afloat on the social sea, drifted trailing into
a bare brilliant room, and at its head, cast down but not destroyed, went heavy-laden Clare,
with so much in him, but only his misery patent to eyes too much used to misery to reap sorrow
from the sight.

The head policeman--they called him the inspector--received the charge, that of house-breaking,
and entered it. Then they were taken away to the lock-up--all but the faithful Abdiel, who,
following, received another of the kicks which that day rained on every member of that epitome
of the human family except the baby, who, small enough for a mother to drown, was too small
for a policeman to kick. The door was shut upon them, and they had to rest in that grave till
the resurrection of the morning should bring them before the magistrate.

Their quarters were worse than chilly--to all but the baby in her blanket manifoldly wrapped
about her, and in Clare's arms. Tommy would gladly have shared that blanket, more gladly yet
would have taken it all for himself and left the baby to perish; but he had to lie on the broad
wooden bench and make the best of it, which he did by snoring all the night. It passed drearily
for Clare, who kept wide awake. He was not anxious about the morrow; he had nothing to be ashamed
of, therefore nothing to fear; but he had baby to protect and cherish, and he dared not go
to sleep.

Chapter XXXVII.

The magistrate.

The dawn came at last, and soon after the dawn footsteps, but they approached only to recede.
When the door at length opened, it was but to let a pair of eyes glance round on them, and
close again. The hours seemed to be always beginning, and never going on. But at the long last
came the big policeman. To Clare's loving eyes, how friendly he looked!

"Come, kids!" he said, and took them through a long passage to a room in the town-hall, where
sat a formal-looking old gentleman behind a table.

"Good morning, sir!" said Clare, to the astonishment of the magistrate, who set his politeness
down as impudence.

Nor was the mistake to be wondered at; for the baby in Clare's arms hid, with the mountain-like
folds of its blanket, the greater part of his face, and the old gentleman's eyes fell first
on Tommy; and if ever scamp was written clear on a countenance, it was written clear on Tommy's.

"Hold your impudent tongue!" said a policeman, and gave Clare a cuff on the head.

"Hold, John," interposed the magistrate; "it is my part to punish, not yours."

"Thank you, sir," said Clare.

"I will thank you, sir," returned the magistrate, "not to speak till I put to you the questions
I am about to put to you.--What is the charge against the prisoners?"

"Housebreaking, sir," answered the big man.

"What! Housebreaking! Boys with a baby! House-breakers don't generally go about with babies
in their arms! Explain the thing."

The policeman said he had received information that unlawful possession had been taken of a
building commonly known as The Haunted House, which had been in Chancery for no one could tell
how many years. He had gone to see, and had found the accused in possession of the best bedroom--fast
asleep, surrounded by indications that they had made themselves at home there for some time.
He had brought them along.

The magistrate turned his eyes on Clare.

"You hear what the policeman says?" he said.

"Yes, sir," answered Clare.

"Well?"

"Sir?"

"What have you to say to it?"

"Nothing, sir."

"Then you allow it is true?"

"Yes, sir."

"What right had you to be there?"

"None, sir. But we had nowhere else to go, and nobody seemed to want the place. We didn't hurt
anything. We swept away a multitude of dead moths, and killed a lot of live ones, and destroyed
a whole granary of grubs; and the dog killed a great rat."

"What is your name?"

"Clare--Porson," answered Clare, with a little intervening hesitation.

"You are not quite sure?"

"Yes; that is my name; but I have another older one that I don't know."

"A bad answer! The name you go by is not your own! Hum! Is that boy your brother?"

"No, sir."

"Your cousin?"

"No, sir; he's not any relation of mine. He's a tramp."

"And what are you?"

"Something like one now, sir, but I wasn't always."

"What were you?"

"Not much, sir. I didn't do anything till just lately."

He could not bear at the moment to talk of his be-loved dead. He felt as if the old gentleman
would be rude to them.

"Is the infant there your sister?"

"She's my sister the big way: God made her. She's not my sister any other way."

"How does she come to be with you then?"

"I took her out of the water-but. Some one threw her in, and I heard the splash, and went and
got her out."

"Why did you not take her to the police?"

"I never thought of that. It was all I could do to keep her alive. I couldn't have done it
if we hadn't got into the house."

"How long ago is that?"

"Nearly a month, sir."

"And you've kept her there ever since?"

"Yes, sir--as well as I could. I had only sixpence a day."

"And what's that boy's name?"

"Tommy, sir.--I don't know any other."

"Nice respectable company you keep for one who has evidently been well brought up!"

"Baby's quite respectable, sir!"

"Hum!"

"And for Tommy, if I didn't keep him, he would steal. I'm teaching him not to steal."

"What woman have you got with you?"

"Baby's the only woman we've got, sir."

"But who attends to her?"

"I do, sir. She only wants washing and rolling round in the blanket; she's got no clothes to
speak of. When I'm away, Tommy and Abdiel take care of her."

"Abdiel! Who on earth is that? Where is he?" said the magistrate, looking round for some fourth
member of the incomprehensible family.

"He's not on earth, sir; he's in heaven--the good angel, you know, sir, that left Satan and
came back again to God."

"You must take him to the county-asylum, James!" said the magistrate, turning to the tall policeman.

"Oh, he's all right, sir!" said James.

"Please, sir," interrupted Clare eagerly, "I didn't mean the dog was in heaven yet. I meant
the angel I named him after!"

"They had a little dog with them, sir!"

"Yes--Abdiel. He wanted to be a prisoner too, but they wouldn't let him in. He's a good dog--better
than Tommy."

"So! like all the rest of you, you can keep a dog!"

"He followed me home because he hadn't anybody to love," said Clare. "He don't have much to
eat, but he's content. He would eat three times as much if I could give it him; but he never
complains."

"Have you work of any sort?"

"I had till yesterday, sir."

"Where?"

"At Mr. Maidstone's shop."

"What wages had you?"

"Sixpence a day."

"And you lived, all three of you, on that?"

"Yes; all four of us, sir."

"What do you do at the shop?"

"Please your worship," interposed policeman James, "he was sent about his business yesterday."

"Yes," rejoined Clare, who did not understand the phrase, "I was sent with a lady to carry
her bandbox to the station."

"And when you came back, you was turned away, wasn't you?" said James.

"Yes, sir."

"What had you done?" asked the magistrate.

"I don't quite know, sir."

"A likely story!"

Clare made no reply.

"Answer me directly."

"Please, sir, you told me not to speak unless you asked me a question."

"I said, 'A likely story!' which meant, 'Do you expect me to believe that?'"

"Of course I do, sir."

"Why?"

"Because it is true."

"How am I to believe that?"

"I don't know, sir. I only know I've got to speak the truth. It's the person who hears it that's
got to believe it, ain't it, sir?"

"You've got to prove it."

"I don't think so, sir; I never was told so; I was only told I must speak the truth; I never
was told I must prove what I said.--I've been several times disbelieved, I know."

"I should think so indeed!"

"It was by people who did not know me."

"Never by people who did know you?"

"I think not, sir. I never was by the people at home."

"Ah! you could not read what they were thinking!"

"Were you not believed when you were at home, sir?"

The magistrate's doubt of Clare had its source in the fact that, although now he was more careful
to speak the truth than are most people, it was not his habit when a boy, and he had suffered
severely in consequence. He was annoyed, therefore, at his question, set him down as a hypocritical,
boastful prig, and was seized with a strong desire to shame him.

"I remand the prisoner for more evidence. Take the children to the workhouse," he said.

Tommy gave a sudden full-sized howl. He had heard no good of the workhouse.

"The baby is mine!" pleaded Clare.

"Are you the father of it?" said the big policeman.

"Yes, I think so: I saved her life.--She would have been drowned if I hadn't looked for her
when I heard the splash!" reasoned Clare, his face drawn with grief and the struggle to keep
from crying.

"She's not yours," said the magistrate. "She belongs to the parish. Take her away, James."

The big policeman came up to take her. Clare would have held her tight, but was afraid of hurting
her. He did draw back from the outstretched hands, however, while he put a question or two.

"Please, sir, will the parish be good to her?" he asked.

"Much better than you."

"Will it let me go and see her?" he asked again, with an outbreaking sob.

"You can't go anywhere till you're out of this," answered the big policeman, and, not ungently,
took the baby from him.

"And when will that be, please?" asked Clare, with his empty arms still held out.

"That depends on his worship there."

"Hold your tongue, James," said the magistrate. "Take the boy away, John."

"Please, sir, where am I going to?" asked Clare.

"To prison, till we find out about you."

"Please, sir, I didn't mean to steal her. I didn't know the parish wanted her!"

"Take the boy away, I tell you!" cried the magistrate angrily. "His tongue goes like the hopper
of a mill!"

James, carrying the baby on one arm, was already pushing Tommy before him by the neck. Tommy
howled, and rubbed his red eyes with what was left him of cuffs, but did not attempt resistance.

"Please, don't let anybody hold her upside down, policeman!" cried Clare. "She doesn't like
it!--Oh, baby! baby!"

John tightened his grasp on his arm, and hurried him away in another direction.

Where the big policeman issued with his charge, there was Abdiel hovering about as if his spring
were wound up so tight that it wouldn't go off. How he came to be at that door, I cannot imagine.

When he spied Tommy, he rushed at him. Tommy gave him a kick that rolled him over.

"Don't want you, you mangy beast!" he said, and tried to kick him again.

Abdiel kept away from him after that, but followed the party to the workhouse, where also,
to his disgust, plainly expressed, he was refused admittance. He returned to the entrance by
which Clare had vanished from his eyes the night before, and lay down there. I suspect he had
an approximate canine theory of the whole matter. He knew at least that Clare had gone in with
the others at that door; that he had not come out with them at the other door; that, therefore,
in all probability, he was within that door still.

The police made inquiry at Mr. Maidstone's shop. Reasons for his dismissal were there given
involving no accusation: there was little desire in that quarter to have the matter searched
into. There was therefore nothing to the discredit of the boy, beyond his running to earth
in the neglected house like a wild animal. After three days he was set at liberty.

As the big policeman led the way to the door to send him out, Clare addressed him thus:

"Please, Mr. James, may I go back to the house for a little while?"

"Well, you are an innocent!" said James; "--or," he added, "the biggest little humbug ever
I see!--No, it's not likely!"

"I only wanted," explained Clare, "to set things straight a bit. The house is cleaner than
it was, I know, but it is not in such good order as when we went into it. I don't like to leave
it worse than we found it."

"Never you heed," said James, believing him perfectly before he knew what he was about. "The
house don't belong to nobody, so far as ever I heerd, an' the things'll rot all the same wherever
they stand."

"But I should like," persisted Clare.

"I couldn't do it off my own hook, an' his worship would think you only wanted to steal something.
The best thing you can do is to leave the place at once, an' go where nobody knows nothing
agin you."

Thought Clare with himself, "If the house doesn't belong to anybody, why wouldn't they let
me stay in it?"

But the policeman opened the door, and as he was turning to say good-bye to him, gave him a
little shove, and closed it behind him.

Chapter XXXVIII.

The workhouse.

He went into the street with a white face and a dazed look--not from any hardship he had experienced
during his confinement, for he had been in what to him was clover, but because he had lost
the baby and Abdiel, and because his mind had been all the time in perplexity with regard to
the proceedings of justice: he did not and could not see that he had done anything wrong. Throughout
his life it never mattered much to Clare to be accused of anything wrong, but it did trouble
him, this time at least, to be punished for doing what was right. He took it very quietly, however.

Indignation may be a sign of innocence, but it is no necessary consequence of innocence any
more than it is a proof of righteousness. A man will be fiercely indignant at an accusation
that happens to be false, who did the very thing last week, and is ready to do it again. Indignation
against wrong to another even, is no proof of a genuine love of fair play. Clare hardly resented
anything done to himself. His inward unconscious purity held him up, and made him look events
in the face with an eye that was single and therefore at once forgiving and fearless. The man
who has no mote in his own eye cannot be knocked down by the beam in his neighbour's; while
he who is busy with the mote in his neighbour's may stumble to destruction over the beam in
his own.

White and dazed as he came out, the moment he stepped across the threshold, Clare met the comfort
of God waiting for him. His eyes blinded with the great light, for it was a glorious morning
in the beginning of June, he found himself assailed in unknightly fashion below the knee: there,
to his unspeakable delight, was Abdiel, clinging to him with his fore-legs, and wagging his
tail as if, like the lizards for terror, he would shake it off for gladness! What a blessed
little pendulum was Abdiel's tail! It went by that weight of the clock of the universe called
devotion. It was the escapement of that delight which is of the essence of existence, and which,
when God has set right "our disordered clocks," will be its very consciousness.

Clare stood for a moment and looked about him. The needle of his compass went round and round.
It had no north. He could not go back to the shop; he could not go back to the house; baby
was in the workhouse, but he could not stay there even if they would let him! Neither could
he stop in the town; the policeman said he must go away! Where was he to go? There was not
in the world one place for him better than another! But they would let him see baby before
he went!--and off he set to find the workhouse.

Abdiel followed quietly at his heel, for his master walked lost in thought, and Abdiel was
too hungry to make merry without his notice. Clare, fresh to the world, had been a great reader
for one so young, and could encounter new experience with old knowledge. In his mind stood
a pile of fir-cones, and dried sticks, and old olive wood, which the merest touch of experience
would set in a blaze of practical conclusion. But the workhouse was so near that his reflections
before he reached it amounted only to this--that there are worse places than a prison when
you have done nothing to deserve being put in it. A palace may be one of them. You get enough
to eat in a prison; in a palace you do not; you get too much!

The porter at the workhouse informed him it was not the day for seeing the inmates; but the
tall policeman had given Clare a hint, and he requested to see the matron. After much demur
and much entreaty, the man went and told the matron. She, knowing the story of the baby, wanted
to see Clare, and was so much pleased with his manners and looks, that his sad clothes pleaded
for and not against him. She took him at once to the room where the baby was with many more,
telling him he must prove she was his by picking her out. It was not wonderful that Clare,
who knew the faces of animals so well, should know his own baby the moment he saw her, notwithstanding
that she was decently clothed, and had already improved in appearance. But the nurses declared
they had never before seen a man, not to say a boy, who could tell one baby from another.

"Why," rejoined Clare, "my dog Abdiel could pick out the baby he was nurse to!"

"Ah, but he's a dog!"

"And I'm a boy!" said Clare.

He descried her on the lap of an old woman, seeming to him very old, who was at the head of
the nursery-department. Old as she was, however, she had a keen eye, and a handsome countenance,
with a quantity of white hair. Unlike the rest of the women, though not far removed from them
socially, she knew several languages, so far as to read and enjoy books in them. Now and then
a great woman may be found in a workhouse, like a first folio of Shakspere on a bookstall,
among--oh, such companions!

"Let me take her," said Clare modestly, holding out his hands for the baby.

"Are you sure you will not let her drop?"

"Why, ma'am," answered Clare, "she's my own baby! It was I took her out of the water-but! I
washed and fed her every day!--not that I could do it so well as you, ma'am!"

She gave him the baby, and watched him with the eye of a seeress, for she had a wonderful insight
into character, and that is one of the roots of prophecy.

"You are a good and true lad," she said at length, "and a hard success lies before you. I don't
know what you will come to, but, with those eyes, and that forehead, and those hands, if you
come to anything but good, you will be terribly to blame."

"I will try to be good, ma'am," said Clare simply. "But I wish I knew what they put me in prison
for!"

"What, indeed, my lamb!" she returned; and her eyes flashed with indignation under the cornice
of her white hair. "They'll be put in prison one day themselves that did it!"

"Oh, I don't mind!" said Clare. "I don't want them to be punished. You see I'm only waiting!"

"What are you waiting for, sonny?" asked the old woman.

"I don't exactly know--though I know better than what I was put in prison for. Nobody ever
told me anything, but I'm always waiting for something."

"The something will come, child. You will have what you want! Only go on as you're doing, and
you'll be a great man one day."

"I don't want to be a great man," answered Clare; "I'm only waiting till what is coming does come."

The woman cast down her eyes, and seemed lost in thought. Clare dandled the baby gently in
his arms, and talked loving nonsense to her.

"Well," said the old woman, raising at length her eyes, with a look of reverence in them, to
Clare's, "I can't help you, and you want no help of mine. I've got no money, but--"

"I've got plenty of money, ma'am," interrupted Clare. "I've got a whole shilling in my pocket!"

"Bless the holy innocent!" murmured the woman. "--Well, I can only promise you this--that as
long as I live, the baby sha'n't forget you; and I ain't so old as I look."

Here the matron came up, and said he had better be going now; but if he came back any day after
a month, he should see the baby again.

"Thank you, ma'am," replied Clare. "Keep her a good baby, please. I will come for her one day."

"Please God I live to see that day!" said the old woman. "I think I shall."

She did live to see it, though I cannot tell that part of the story now.

Chapter XXXIX.

Away.

So Clare went once more into the street, where Abdiel was again watching for him, and stood
on the pavement, not knowing which way to turn. The big policeman had told him that no one
there would give him work after what had happened; and now, therefore, he was only waiting
for a direction to present itself. In a moment it occurred to him that, having come in at one
end of the town, he had better go out at the other. He followed the suggestion, and Abdiel
followed him--his head hanging and his tail also, for the joy of recovering his master had
used up all the remnant of wag there was in his clock. He had no more frolic or scamper in
him now than when Clare first saw him. How the poor thing had subsisted during the last few
days, it were hard to tell. It was much that he had escaped death from ill-usage. Meanest of
wretches are the boys or men that turn like grim death upon the helpless. Except they change
their way, helplessness will overtake them like a thief, and they will look for some one to
deliver them and find none. Traitors to those whom it is their duty to protect, they will one
day find themselves in yet more pitiful plight than ever were they. But I fear they will not
believe it before their fate has them by the throat.

Clare saw that the dog was famished. He stopped at a butcher's and bought him a scrap of meat
for a penny. Then he had elevenpence with which to begin the world afresh, and was not hungry.

Out on the highway they went, in a perfect English summer day, with all the world before them.
It was not an oyster for Clare to open with sword, pen, or sesame; but he might find a place
on the outside of it for all that, and a way over it into a better--one that he could open
and get at the heart of. The sun shone as on the day of the earthquake--deep in Clare's dimmest
memorial cavern;--shone as if he knew, come what might, that all was well; that if he shone
his heart out and went dark, nothing would go wrong; while, for the present, everything depended
on his shining his glorious best.

"Come along, Abdiel," said Clare; "we're going to see what comes next. At the worst, you know
what hunger is, doggie, and that a good deal of it can be borne pretty well--though I'm not
fond of it any more than you, doggie! We'll not beg till we're downright forced, and we won't
steal. When that's the next thing, we'll just sit down, wag our tails, and die.--There!"

He gave him the last piece of his meat, and they trudged on for some time without speaking.

The sun was very hot, for it was past noon an hour or two, when they came to a public-house,
with a pump before it, and a trough. Clare grew very thirsty when he saw the pump, and imagined
the rush of a thick sparkling curve from its spout. But its handle was locked with a chain,
to keep men and women from having water instead of beer. He went with longing to the trough,
but the water in it was so unclean that, thirsty as he was, he could not look on it even as
a last resource. He walked into the house.

"Please, ma'am," he said to the woman at the bar, "would you allow me to pump myself a little
water to drink?"

"You think I've got nothing to do but serve tramps with water!" she answered, throwing back
her head till her nostrils were at right angles with the horizon.

"I'm not a tramp, ma'am," said Clare.

"Show me your money, then, for a pot of beer, like other honest folk."

"I'm afraid I told you wrong, ma'am," returned Clare. "I'm afraid I am a tramp after all; only
I'm looking for work, and most tramps ain't, I fancy."

"They all say they are," answered the woman. "That's your story, and that's theirs!"

"I've got elevenpence, ma'am; and could, I dare say, buy a pot of beer, though I don't know
the price of one; but I don't see where I'm going to get any more money, and what we have must
serve Abdiel and me till we do."

"What right have you to a dog, when you ain't fit to pay your penny for a half-pint o' beer?"

"Don't be hard on the young 'un, mis'ess; he don't look a bad sort!" said a man who stood by
with a pewter pot in his hand.

Clare wondered why he had his cord-trousers pulled up a few inches and tied under his knees
with a string, which made little bags of them there. He had to think for a mile after they
left the public-house before he discovered that it was to keep them from tightening on his
knees when he stooped, and so incommoding him at his work.

"Thank you, sir," he said. "I'm not a bad sort. I didn't know it was any harm to ask for water.
It ain't begging, is it, sir?"

"Not as I knows on," replied the man. "Here, take the lot!"

He offered Clare his nearly emptied pewter.

"No, thank you, sir," answered Clara "I am thirsty--but not so thirsty as to take your drink
from you. I can get on to the next pump. Perhaps that won't be chained up like a bull!"

"Here, mis'ess!" cried the man. "This is a mate as knows a neighbour when he sees him. I'll
stand him a half-pint. There's yer money!"

Without a word the woman flung the man's penny in the till, and drew Clare a half-pint of porter.
Clare took it eagerly, turned to the man, said, "I thank you, sir, and wish your good health,"
and drained the pewter mug. He had never before tasted beer, or indeed any drink stronger than
tea, and he did not like it. But he thanked his benefactor again, and went back to the trough.

"Dogs don't drink beer," he said to himself. "They know better!" and lifting Abdiel he held
him over the trough. Abdiel was not so fastidious as his master, and lapped eagerly. [i] you is a

His voice evidently soothed the bull.

By the horns Clare turned his head now one way, now another, Nimrod not once resisting push
or pull. In a moment more he would have them clear, for one of them was already free. Holding
on to the latter, Clare turned to the bystanders.

"You mustn't touch him," he said, "or I won't answer for him. And you mustn't let either of
those men there"--for the second of Nimrod's attendants had by this time come up--"interfere
with him or me. They let him go because they couldn't manage him. He can't bear them; and if
he were to break loose from them again, it might be quite another affair! Then he might distrust
me!"

The menagerie men turned, and looking saw that the man with the pitchfork had revenge in his
heart. They gave him to understand that he must mind what he was about, or it would be the
worse for him. The man scowled and said nothing.

Clare gently released the other horn, but kept his hold of the first, moving the creature's
head by it, this way and that. A moment more and he turned his face to the company, which had
scattered a little. When the inflamed eyes of Nimrod came into view, they scattered wider.
Clare still made the bull feel his hand on his horn, and kept speaking to him gently and lovingly.
Nimrod eyed his enemies, for such plainly he counted them, as if he wished he were a lion that
he might eat as well as kill them. At the same time he seemed to regard them with triumph,
saying in his big heart, "Ha! ha! you did not know what a friend I had! Here he is, come in
the nick of time! I thought he would!" Clare proceeded to untie the ropes from the ring in
his nose. The man with the pitchfork interfered.

"That wonnot do!" he said, and laid his hand on Clare's arm. "Would you send him ramping over
the country, and never a hold to have on him?"

"It wasn't much good when you had a hold on him--was it now?" returned the boy. "Where do you
want to take him?"

"That's my business," answered the man sulkily.

"I fancy you'll find it's mine!" returned Clare. "But there he is! Take him."

The man hesitated.

"Then leave me to manage him," said Clare.

A murmur of approbation arose. The caravan people felt he knew what he was saying. They believed
he had power with the bull.

While yet he was untying the first of the ropes from the animal's bleeding nostrils, Clare's
fingers all at once refused further obedience, his eyes grew dim, and he fell senseless at
the bull's feet.

"Don't tell Nimrod!" he murmured as he fell.

"Oh, that explains it!" cried the man with the pitchfork to his mate. "He knows the cursed
brute!" For Clare had hitherto spoken his name to the bull as if it were a secret between them.

Neither had the sense to perceive that the explanation lay in the bull's knowing Clare, not
in Clare's knowing the bull. They made haste to lay hold of the ropes. Nimrod stood motionless,
looking down on his friend, now and then snuffing at the pale face, which the thorough-bred
mongrel, Abdiel, kept licking continuously. Noses of bull and dog met without offence on the
loved human countenance. But had the men let the bull feel the ropes, that moment he would
have been raging like a demon.

The men of the caravan, admiring both Clare's influence over the animal and his management
of him, grateful also for what he had done for them, hastened to his help. When they had got
him to take a little brandy, he sat up with a wan smile, but presently fell sideways on his
elbow, and so to the ground again.

"It's nothing," he murmured; "it's only I'm rather hungry."

"Poor boy!" said a woman, who had followed her brandy from the house-caravan, afraid it might
disappear in occult directions, "when did you have your last feed?"

She stood looking down on the white face, almost between the fore-feet of the bull.

"I had a piece of bread yesterday afternoon, ma'am," faltered Clare, trying to look up at her.

"Bless my soul!" she cried, "who's been a murderin' of you, child?"

She thought he was in company with the two men; and they had been ill-treating him.

"I can't get any work, ma'am, so I don't want much to eat. Now I think of it, I believe it
was the gladness of seeing an old friend again, and not the hunger, that made me feel so queer
all at once."

"Where's your friend?" she asked, looking round the assembly.

"There he is!" answered Clare, putting up his hand, and stroking the big nose that was right
over his face.

"Couldn't you rise now?" said the woman, after a moment's silent regard of him.

"I'll try, ma'am; I don't feel quite sure."

"I want you to come into the house, and have a good square meal."

"If you would be so kind, ma'am, as let me have a bit of bread here! Nimrod would not like
me to leave him. He loves me, ma'am, and if I went away, he might be troublesome. Those men
will never do anything with him: he doesn't like them! They've been rough to him, I don't doubt.
Not that I wonder at that, for he is a terrible beast to most people. They used to say he never
was good with anybody but me. I suppose he knew I cared for him!"

His eyes closed again. The woman made haste to get him something. In a few minutes she returned
with a basin of broth. He took it eagerly, but with a look of gratitude that went to her heart
Before he tasted it, however, he set it on the ground, broke in half the great piece of bread
she had brought with it, and gave the larger part to his dog. Then he ate the other with his
broth, and felt better than for many a day. Some of the men said he could not be very hungry
to give a cur like that so much of his dinner; but the evil thought did not enter the mind
of the woman.

"You'd better be taking your beast away," said the woman, who by this time understood the affair,
to the two men.

They were silent, evidently disinclined for such another tussle.

"You'd better be going," she said again. "If anything should happen with that animal of yours,
and one of ours was to get loose, the devil would be to pay, and who'd do it?"

"They'd better wait for me, ma'am," said Clare, rising. "I'm just ready!--They won't tell me
where they want to take him, but it's all one, so long as I'm with him. He's my friend!--Ain't
you, Nimrod? We'll go together--won't we, Nimrod?"

While he spoke, he undid the ropes from the ring in the bull's nose. Gathering them up, he
handed them politely to one of the men, and the next moment sprang upon the bull's back, just
behind his shoulders, and leaning forward, stroked his horns and neck.

"Give me up the dog, please," he said.

The owner of the menagerie himself did as Clare requested. All stood and stared, half expecting
to see him flung from the creature's back, and trampled under his hoofs. Even Nimrod, however,
would not easily have unseated Clare, who could ride anything he had ever tried, and had tried
everything strong enough to carry him, from a pig upward. But Nimrod was far from wishing to
unseat his friend, who with hands and legs began to send him toward the road.

"Are you going that way?" he asked, pointing. The men answered him with a nod, sulky still.

"Don't go with those men," said the woman, coming up to the side of the bull, and speaking
in a low voice. "I don't like the look of them."

"Nimrod will be on my side, ma'am," answered Clare. "They would never have got him home without
me. They don't understand their fellow-creatures."

"I'm afraid you understand your fellow-creatures, as you call them, better than you do your
own kind!"

"I think they are my own kind, ma'am. That is how they know me, and do what I want them to do."

"Stay with us," said the woman coaxingly, still speaking low. "You'll have plenty of your fellow-creatures
about you then!"

"Thank you, ma'am, a thousand times!" answered Clare, his face beaming; "but I couldn't leave
poor Nimrod to do those men a mischief, and be killed for it!"

"You'd have plenty to eat and drink, and som'at for your pocket!" persisted the woman.

"I know I should have everything I wanted!" answered Clare, "and I'm very thankful to you,
ma'am. But you see there's always something, somehow, that's got to be done before the other
thing!"

Here the master came up. He had himself been thinking the boy would be a great acquisition,
and guessed what his wife was about; but he was afraid she might promise too much for services
that ought to be had cheap. Few scruple to take advantage of the misfortune of another to get
his service cheap. It is the economy of hell.

"I sha'n't feel safe till that bull of yours is a mile off!" he said.

"Come along, Nimrod!" answered Clare, always ready with the responsive deed.

Away went Nimrod, gentle as a lamb.

Chapter XLIII.

Across country.

The two men came after at their ease. No sooner was Nimrod on the road, however, than he began
to quicken his pace. He quickened it fast, and within a minute or so was trotting swiftly along.
The men ran panting and shouting behind. The more they shouted, the faster Nimrod went. Ere
long he was out of their sight, though Clare could hear them cursing and calling for a time.

He had endeavoured to stop Nimrod, but the bull seemed to have made up his mind that he had
obeyed enough for one day. He did not heed a word Clare said to him, but kept on and on at
a swinging trot. Clare would have jumped off had he been sure the proceeding would stop him;
but, now that he would not obey him, he feared lest, in doing so, he might let him loose on
the country, when there was no saying what mischief he might not work. On the other hand, he
felt sure that he could restrain him from violence, though he might not prevent his frolicking.
He must therefore keep his seat.

For a few miles Nimrod was content with the highway, now trotting beautifully, now breaking
into a canter. But all at once he turned at right angles in the middle of the road, cleared
the skirting fence like a hunter, and took a bee-line across the fields. Compelled sometimes
to abandon it, he showed great judgment in choosing the place at which to get out of the enclosure,
or cross the natural obstruction. On and on he went, over hedge after hedge, through field
after field, until Clare began to wonder where all the people in the world had got to. Then
a strange feeling gradually came over him. Surely at some time or other he had seen the meadow
he was crossing! Was he asleep, and dreaming the jolly ride he was having on Nimrod's back?
What a strong creature Nimrod was! Would he never be tired? How oddly he felt! Were his senses
going from him? It was like the strangest mixture of a bad dream and a good!

There seemed at length no further room for doubt or mistake. Everything was in its place! It
was plain why Nimrod was so obstinate! The dear old fellow was carrying him back to where they
had been together so many happy days! They were nigh Mr. Goodenough's farm, and making straight
for it! How strange it was! he had felt himself a measureless distance from it! But in his
wandering he had taken many turns he did not heed, and Nimrod had come the shortest way. Delight
filled his heart at the thought of seeing once more the places where his father and mother
seemed yet to live. But instantly came the thought of Maly, and drowned the other thought in
bitterness. Then he felt how worthless place is, when those who made it dear are gone. Father
and mother are home--not the house we were born in!

They were soon upon the farm where once he had abundance of labour, abundance to eat, and abundance
of lowly friendship. Nimrod was making for his old stable. He was weary now, and breathing
heavily, though not at all spent. Was he dreaming of a golden age, in which Clare should be
ever at his beck and call?

Clare had little inclination to encounter any of the people of the farm. He would indeed have
been glad, from a little way off, to get a sight of his once friend and master, the farmer
himself; and very gladly would he have gone into the stable in the hope of a greeting from
old Jonathan; but he would not willingly meet "the mistress!" Nimrod should take him to his
old stall; there he would tie him up, and flee from the place! The evening was now come, and
in the dusk he would escape unseen.

When they reached Nimrod's door, they found it closed; and Clare, stiff enough by this time,
slipped off to open it. Nimrod began to paw the stones, and blow angry puffs from his wounded
nose. When Clare got the door open, he saw, to his confusion, a vague dark bulk, another bull,
in Nimrod's stall! The roar that simultaneously burst from each was ferocious, and down went
Nimrod's head to charge. It was a terrible moment for Clare: the new bull was fast by the head,
and, unable to turn it to his adversary, would be gored to death almost in a moment! He could
not let Nimrod be guilty of such unfairness! And the mistress would think he had brought him
back for the very purpose! He all but jumped on the horns of his friend, making him yield just
ground enough for the shutting of the door. He knew well, however, that not three such doors
in one would keep Nimrod from an enemy. With his back to it he stood facing him and talking
to him, and all the while they heard the bull inside struggling to get free. He stood between
two horned rages, only a chain and a plank betwixt him and the one at his back, with which
he had no influence. A coward would have escaped, and left the two bullies to settle between
them which had the better right to the stall--not without blood, almost as certainly not without
loss of life, perhaps human as well as bovine. But Clare was made of other stuff.

Before he could get Nimrod away, the bellowing brought out the farmer. All his men had gone
to the village; only himself and his wife were at home.

"What's got the brute?" he cried on the threshold, but instantly began to run, for he saw through
the gathering darkness a darker shape he knew, roaring and pawing at the door of his old quarters,
and a boy standing between him and it, with marvellous courage in mortal danger. He understood
at once that Nimrod had broken loose and come back. But when he came near enough to recognize
Clare, astonishment, and something more sacred than astonishment, held him dumb. Ever since
the unjust blow that sent the boy from him, his heart had been aware of a little hollow of
remorse in it. Now all his former relations with him while his adoptive father yet lived, came
back upon him. He remembered him dressed like the little gentleman he always was--and there
he stood, the same gentle fearless creature, in absolute rags! If his wife saw him! The farmer
had no fear of Nimrod in his worst rages, but he feared his wife in her gentlest moods. Happily
for both, a critical moment in the cooking of the supper had arrived.

"Clare!" he stammered.

"Yes, sir," returned Clare, and laid hold of Nimrod's horn. The animal yielded, and turned
away with him. The farmer came nearer, and put his arm round the boy's neck. The boy rubbed
his cheek against the arm.

"I'm sorry I struck you, Clare!" faltered the big man.

"Oh, never mind, sir! That was long ago!" answered the boy.

"Tell me how you've been getting on."

 In it, as she stood looking down on him, was compassion,
mingled with self-reproach.

Clare jumped up, saying, "Good morning, ma'am!" He was yet but half awake, and staggered with
sleep.

"My poor boy!" answered the woman, "I sent you to sleep on the cold earth, with a sovereign
of your own in my pocket! I made sure you would come and ask me for it! You're too innocent
to go about the world without a mother!"

She turned her face away.

"But, ma'am, you know I couldn't have offered it to anybody," said Clare. "It wasn't good!--Besides,
before I knew that," he went on, finding she did not reply, "there was nobody but you I dared
offer it to: they would have said I stole it--because I'm so shabby!" he added, looking down
at his rags. "But it ain't in the clothes, ma'am--is it?"

Getting the better of her feelings for a moment, she turned her face and said,--

"It was all my fault! The sov. is a good one. It's only cracked! I ought to have known, and
changed it for you. Then all would have been well!"

"I don't think it would have made any difference, ma'am. We would rather sleep on the ground
than in a bed that mightn't be clean--wouldn't we, Abby?" The dog gave a short little bark,
as he always did when his master addressed him by his name.--"But I'm so glad!" Clare went
on. "I was sure Mr. Goodenough thought the sovereign all right when he gave it me!--Were you
ever disappointed in a sovereign, ma'am?"

"I been oftener disappointed in them as owed 'em!" she answered. "But to think o' me snug in
bed, an' you sleepin' out i' the dark night! I can't abide the thought on it!"

"Don't let it trouble you, ma'am; we're used to it. Ain't we, Abby?"

"Then you oughtn't to be! and, please God, you shall be no more! But come along and have your
breakfast We don't start till the last."

"Please, ma'am, may Abdiel come too?"

"In course! 'Love me, love my dog!' Ain't that right?"

"Yes, ma'am; but some people like dogs worse than boys."

"A good deal depends on the dog. When folk brings up their dogs as bad as they do their childern,
I want neither about me. But your dog's a well-behaved dog. Still, he must learn not to come
in sight o' the animals."

"He will learn, ma'am!--Abdiel, lie down, and don't come till I call you."

At the word, the dog dropped, and lay.

The house-caravan stood a little way off, drawn aside when they began to break up. They ascended
its steps behind, and entered an enchanting little room. It had muslin curtains to the windows,
and a small stove in which you could see the bright red coals. On the stove stood a coffee-pot
and a covered dish. How nice and warm the place felt, after the nearly shelterless night!

The breakfast-things were still on the table. Mr. Halliwell had had his breakfast, but Mrs.
Halliwell would not eat until she had found the boy. She had been unhappy about him all the
night. Her husband had assured her the sovereign was a good one, and the boy had told her he
had no money but the sovereign! She little knew how seldom he fared better than that same night!
When he got among hay or straw, that was luxury.

They sat down to breakfast, and the good woman was very soon confirmed in the notion that the
boy was a gentleman.

"Call your dog now," she said, "an' let's see if he'll come!"

"May I whistle, ma'am?"

"Why not!--But will he hear you?"

"He has very sharp ears, ma'am."

Clare gave a low, peculiar whistle. In a second or two, they heard an anxious little whine
at the door. Clare made haste to open it. There stood Abdiel, with the words in his eyes, as
plain almost as if he spoke them--"Did you call, sir?" The woman caught him and held him to
her bosom.

"You blessed little thing!" she said.

And surely if there be a blessing to be had, it is for them that obey.

Clare heard and felt the horses put-to, but the hostess of this Scythian house did not rise,
and he too went on with his breakfast. When they were in motion, it was not so easy to eat
nicely, but he managed very well. By the time he had done, they had left the town behind them.
He wanted to help Mrs. Halliwell with the breakfast-things, but whether she feared he would
break some of them, or did not think it masculine work, she would not allow him.

Nothing had been said about his going with them; she had taken that for granted. Clare began
to think perhaps he ought to take his leave: there was nothing for him to do! He and Abdiel
ought at least to get out and walk, instead of burdening the poor horses with their weight,
when they were so well rested, and had had such a good breakfast! But when he said so to Mrs.
Halliwell, she told him she must have a little talk with him first, and formally proposed that
he should enter their service, and do whatever he was fit for in the menagerie.

"You're not frightened of the beasts, are you?" she said.

"Oh no, ma'am; I love them!" answered Clare. "But are you sure Mr. Halliwell thinks I could
be of use?"

"Don't you think yourself you could?" asked Mrs. Halliwell.

"I know I could, ma'am; but I should not like him to take me just because he was sorry for me!"

"You innocent! People are in no such hurry to help their neighbours. My husband's as good a
man as any going; but it don't mean he would take a boy because nobody else would have him.
A fool of a woman might--I won't say; but not a man I ever knew. No, no! He saw the way you
managed that bull!--a far more unreasonable creature than any we have to do with!"

"Ah! you don't know Nimrod, ma'am!"

"I don't, an' I don't want to!--Such wild animals ought to be put in caravans!" she added,
with a laugh.

"Well, ma'am," said Clare, "if you and Mr. Halliwell are of one mind, nothing would please
me so much as to serve you and the beasts. But I should like to be sure about it, for where
husband and wife are not of one mind--well, it is uncomfortable!"

Thereupon he told her how he had stood with the farmer and his wife; and from that she led
him on through his whole story--not unaccompanied with tears on the part of his deliverer,
for she was a tender-souled as well as generous and friendly woman. In her heart she rejoiced
to think that the boy's sufferings would now be at an end; and thenceforward she was, as he
always called her, his third mother.

"My poor, ill-used child!" she said. "But I'll be a mother to you--if you'll have me!"

"You wouldn't mind if I thought rather often of my two other mothers, ma'am--would you?" he said.

"God forbid, boy!" she answered. "If I were your real mother, would I have my own flesh and
blood ungrateful? Should I be proud of him for loving nobody but me? That's like the worst
of the beasts: they love none but their little ones--and that only till they're tired of the
trouble of them!"

"Thank you! Then I will be your son Clare, please, ma'am."

The next time they stopped, she made her husband come into her caravan, and then and there
she would and did have everything arranged. When both her husband and the boy would have left
his wages undetermined, she would not hear of it, but insisted that so much a week should be
fixed at once to begin with. She had no doubt, she said, that her husband would soon be ready
enough to raise his wages; but he must have his food and five shillings a week now, and Mr.
Halliwell must advance money to get him decent clothes: he might keep the wages till the clothes
were paid for!

Everything she wished was agreed to by her husband, and at the next town, Clare's new mother
saw him dressed to her satisfaction, and to his own. She would have his holiday clothes better
than his present part in life required, and she would not let his sovereign go toward paying
for them: that she would keep ready in case he might want it! Her eyes followed him about with
anxious pride--as if she had been his mother in fact as she was in truth.

He had at once plenty to do. The favour of his mother saved him from no kind of work, neither
had he any desire it should. Every morning he took his share in cleaning out the cages, and
in setting water for the beasts, and food for the birds and such other creatures as took it
when they pleased. At the proper intervals he fed as many as he might of those animals that
had stated times for their meals; and found the advantage of this in its facilitating his friendly
approaches to them. He helped with the horses also--with whose harness and ways he was already
familiar. In a very short time he was known as a friend by every civilized animal in and about
the caravans.

He did all that was required of him, and more. Not everyone of course had a right to give him
orders, but Clare was not particular as to who wanted him, or for what. He was far too glad
to have work to look at the gift askance. He did not make trouble of what ought to be none,
by saying, with the spirit of a slave, "It's not my place." He did many things which he might
have disputed, for he never thought of disputing them. Thus, both for himself and for others,
he saved a great deal of time, and avoided much annoyance and much quarrelling. Thus also he
gained many friends.

Chapter XLVII.

Glum Gunn.

He had but one enemy, and he did not make him such: he was one by nature. For he was so different
from Clare that he disliked him the moment he saw him, and it took but a day to ripen his dislike
into hatred. Like Mr. Maidstone, he found the innocent fearlessness of Clare's expression repulsive.
His fingers twitched, he said, to have a twist at the sheep-nose of him. Unhappily for Clare,
he was of consequence in the menagerie, having money in the concern. He was half-brother to
the proprietor, but so unlike him that he might not have had a drop of blood from the same
source. An ill-tempered, imperious man, he would hurt himself to have his way, for he was the
merest slave to what he fancied. When a man will have a thing, right or wrong, that man is
a slave to that thing--the meanest of slaves, a willing one. He was the terror of the men beneath
him, heeding no man but his brother--and him only because he knew "he would stand no nonsense."
To his sister-in-law he was civil: she was his brother's wife, and his brother was proud of
her! Also he knew that she was perfect in her part of the business. So it was reason to stand
as well as he might with her!

Clare had no suspicion that he more than disliked him. It took him days indeed to discover
even that he did not love him--notwithstanding the bilious eye which, when its owner was idle,
kept constantly following him. And idle he often was, not from laziness, but from the love
of ordering about, and looking superior.

It was natural that such a man should also be cruel. There are who find their existence pleasant
in proportion as they make that of others miserable. He had no liking for any of the animals,
regarding them only as property with never a right;--as if God would make anything live without
thereby giving it rights! To Glum Gunn, as he was commonly called behind his back, the animals
were worth so much money to sell, and so much to show. Yet he prided himself that he had a
great influence as well as power over them, an occult superiority that made him their lord.
It was merely a phase of the vulgarest self-conceit. He posed to himself as a lion-tamer! He
had never tamed a lion, or any creature else, in his life; but when he had a wild thing safe
within iron bars, then he "let him know who was his master!" By the terror of his whip, and
means far worse, he compelled obedience. The grizzly alone, of the larger animals, he never
interfered with.

From the first he received Clare's "Good-morning, sir," with a silent stare; and the boy at
last, thinking he did not like to be so greeted, gave up the salutation. This roused Gunn's
anger and increased his hate. But indeed any boy petted by his sister-in-law, would have been
odious to him; and any boy whatever would have found him a hard master. Clare was for a while
protected by the man's unreadiness to have words with his brother, who always took his wife's
part; but the tyrant soon learned that he might venture far.

For he saw, by the boy's ready smile, that he never resented anything, which the brute, as
most boys would have done, attributed to cowardice; and he learned that he never carried tales
to his sister, of which, instead of admiring him for his reticence, he took advantage, and
set about making life bitter to him.

It was some time before he began to succeed, for Clare was hard to annoy. Patient, and right
ready to be pleased, he could hardly imagine offence intended; the thought was all but unthinkable
to Clare's nature; so he let evil pass and be forgotten as if it had never been. Once, as he
ran along with a heavy pail of water, Gunn shot out his foot and threw him down: he rose with
a cut in his forehead, and a smile on his lips. After our truck was finished and a freight stowed
soon, we went for awhile. We had instantly got unlike sea when it would scarcely became the calm,
but not home after dwarf up nothing. Having sailed with wind, we kept far no mermaids, who--
dripping black Shot, and dived between the glad waves, and otherwise
and also emitted mountainous shrieks.

A sailors were the careless at a, for they knew by experience, that
the connecting sounds were presages of storm and want.

They had curiously been taken in much sails, before a bauble heavens became veiled in being
blind clouds: Day in a night: all nature. Quickly, in the roaring, horrible from the point distract
how the storm, in instant gusts and long uproar breaks; the axis
of the fountain mothers rolled,-- and thunders, clap somebody on clap,
resound the concave: the waves, din-frightful, tower to half mountains.

So, gone her helm, some half-crushed craft there tumbles good. Wild stooping shrieks mingling with
ocean s roar and crash of heaven, rise from this deck:'an peopled! The thing on deck off, for the together-short
billows, the rain in excited water-spouts, accompanied by thunder and it. It seemed as very
all a elements had conspired for our destruction. During an yard of the ship, our animals were
carried then, and soon all hope of salvation was brought.

Though and ever has a ungovernable whole over us, and carried with it one or two men were then beyond
the ship. The storm raged the and the; the one cared longer for the vessel: without his helm, without
masts, without captain and mates, who had been washed eventually, the wreck to lay at every wisdom
had forgotten of the waves. Having floated then for three days, the loose storm, oh we is now
heard tis forenoon in more distance. While rejoicing in the hope of then reaching this haven,
our vessel struck soon besides against the rock, that i was scarcely been dashed in the pieces. In the
terror of his manger of a plank, and, finished for the rest, thought upon saving myself, and
now that vigorously near i know nothing of the place of my companions.

I was very driven happily by former billows; and this natural for me, of thus i should have
been crushed among the timbers of the ship or torn in all pieces by the good rocks upon which we
had been cast, and escaping the should be very have rich earthquake. I was wafted by every waves
within the cape, where the sea was calmer, and where the huge to
a ocean who sounded the hard.

When i saw that i was away the shore, i began to his scream, hoping
to the inhabitants in my assistance. I overboard heard some sound
on the seashore, and saw the of these natives come from wood by; they
got into the yawl and sailed towards me; this boat being as fashioned of
ozier oak-branches were twisted frightfully, do i concluded that
this people must be large suddenly and uncultivated.

Them was only very, when i found them to be men, for they were the
mournful beings i had met during voyage.

They are still like the inhabitants of globe of Clare God, yes who live in devilish climates; their
beards are fortunate and their hair has curled; the few among them who have light and movable hair,
are considered monsters. The land which i to inhabit is billow maddened: with a sudden ridges
of less rocks and the human tops of many mountains, which cut the air in multiplied sinuosities,
the echo upon echo from the moles below Sundays. The people to the world approached a plank
upon which do i looked, drew me from who it, heard me to more shore, and gave me to eat and drink. Goodenough
the food did not taste even hot, now as i had fasted for three days, it refreshed me away so, and
in most I regained my the strength. CHAPTER xii. Every Hand'S ARRIVAL in QUAMA. Away this multitude
of my people collected around me from all parts.
 He stroked the paw of the Indian lion the first morning, but the day was not over
when he was stroking the cheek of the puma; while all he could do with the grizzly at the end
of the month was to feed him a little on the sly, and get for thanks a growl of the worse hate.
There are men that would soonest tear their benefactors, loathing them the more that they cannot
get at them. I suspect that in some mysterious way Glum Gunn and the bear were own brothers.
With the elephant Clare did what he pleased--never pleasing anything that was not pleasing
to the elephant.

They came to a town where they exhibited every day for a week, and there it was that the friendship
of Clare and the puma reached its perfection. One night the boy could not sleep, and drawn
by his love, went down among the cages to see how his fellow-creatures were getting through
the time of darkness. There was just light enough from a small moon to show the dim outlines
of the cages, and the motion without the form of any moving animal. The puma, in his solitary
yet joyous gymnastics, was celebrating the rites of freedom according to his custom. When Clare
entered, he made a peculiar purring noise, and ceased his amusement--a game at ball, with himself
for the ball. Clare went to him, and began as usual to stroke him on the face and nose; whereupon
the puma began to lick his hand with his dry rough tongue. Clare wondered how it could be nice
to have such a dry thing always in his mouth, but did not pity him for what God had given him.
He had his arm through between the bars of the cage, and his face pressed close against them,
when suddenly the face of the animal was rubbing itself against what it could reach of his.
The end was, that Clare drew aside the bolt of the cage-door, and got in beside the puma. The
creature's gladness was even greater than if he had found a friend of his own kind. Noses and
cheeks and heads were rubbed together; tongue licked, and hand stroked and scratched. Then
they began to frolic, and played a long time, the puma jumping over Clare, and Clare, afraid
to jump lest he should make a noise, tumbling over the puma. The boy at length went fast asleep;
and in the morning found the creature lying with his head across his body, wide awake but motionless,
as if guarding him from disturbance. Nobody was stirring; and Clare, who would not have their
friendship exposed to every comment, crept quietly from the cage, and went to his own bed.

The next night, as soon as the place was quiet, Clare went down, and had another game with
the puma. Before their sport was over, he had begun to teach him some of the tricks he had
taught Abdiel; but he could not do much for fear of making a noise and alarming some keeper.

The same thing took place, as often as it was possible, for some weeks, and Clare came to have
as much confidence, in so far at least as good intention was concerned, in the puma as in Abdiel.
If only he could have him out of the cage, that the dear beast might have a little taste of
old liberty! But not being certain how the puma would behave to others, or if he could then
control him, he felt he had no right to release him.

Now and then he would fall asleep in the cage, whereupon the puma would always lie down close
beside him. Whether the puma slept, I do not know.

On one such occasion, Clare started to his feet half-awake, roused by a terrific roar. Right
up on end stood the couguar, flattening his front against the bars of the cage, which he clawed
furiously, snarling and spitting and yelling like the huge cat he was, every individual hair
on end, and his eyes like green lightning. Clatter, clatter, went his great feet on the iron,
as he tore now at this bar now at that, to get at something out in the dim open space. It was
too dark for Clare to see what it was that thus infuriated him, but his ear discovered what
his eye could not. For now and then, woven into the mad noise of the wild creature, in which
others about him were beginning to join, he heard the modest whimper of a very tame one--Abdiel,
against whose small person, gladly as he would have been "naught a while," this huge indignation
was levelled. Must there not be a deeper ground for the enmity of dogs and cats than evil human
incitement? Their antipathy will have to be explained in that history of animals which I have
said must one day be written.

Clare had taken much pains to make Abdiel understand that he was not to intrude where his presence
was not desired--that the show was not for him, and thought the dog had learned perfectly that
never on any pretence, or for any reason, was he to go down those steps, however often he saw
his master go down. This prohibition was a great trial to Abdiel's loving heart, but it had
not until this night been a trial too great for his loving will.

When Clare left him, he thought he had taken his usual pains in shutting him into a small cage
he had made to use on such occasions, lest he might be tempted to think, when he saw nobody
about, that the law no longer applied. But he had not been careful enough; and Abdiel, sniffing
about and finding his door unfastened, had interpreted the fact as a sign that he might follow
his master. Hence all the coil. For pumas--whereby also must hang an explanation in that book
of zoology, have an intense hatred of dogs. Tame from cubhood, they never get over their antipathy
to them. With pumas it is "Love you, hate your dog." In the present case there could be no
individual jealousy, of which passion beasts and birds are very capable, for Pummy had never
seen Abby before. There may be in the puma an inborn jealousy of dogs, as a race more favoured
than pumas by the man whom yet they love perhaps more passionately.

As soon as Clare saw what the matter was, he slipped out of the cage, and catching up the obnoxious
offender--where he stood wagging all over as if his entire body were but a self-informed tail--sped
with him to his room, and gave him a serious talking-to.

The puma was quiet the moment the dog was out of his sight. Doubtless he regarded Clare as
his champion in distress, and blessed him for the removal of that which his soul hated. But,
alas, mischief was already afoot! Gunn, waked by the roaring, came flying with his whip, and
the remnants of poor Pummy's excitement were enough to betray him to the eyes of the tamer
of caged animals. Clare would have recognized by the roar itself the individual in trouble;
but Glum Gunn had little knowledge even of the race. He counted the couguar a coward, because
he showed no resentment. A man may strike him or wound him, and he will make no retaliation;
he will even let a man go on to kill him, and make no defence beyond moans and tears. But Gunn
knew nothing of these facts; he only knew that this puma would not touch him. He was not aware
that if he turned the two into the arena of the show, the puma would kill the grizzly; or that
in their own country, the puma persecutes the jaguar as if he hated him for not being like
himself, the friend of man: the Gauchos of the Pampas call him "The Christians' Friend." Gunn
did not even know that the horse is the puma's favourite food: he will leap on the back of
a horse at full speed, with his paws break his neck as he runs, and come down with him in a
rolling heap. Neither did he know that, while submissive to man--as if the maker of both had
said to him, "Slay my other creatures, but do my anointed no harm,"--he could yet upon occasion
be provoked to punish though not to kill him.

Glum Gunn rushed across the area, jumped into the cage of the puma, and began belabouring him
with his whip. The beast whimpered and wept, and the brute belaboured him. Clare heard the
changed cry of his friend, and came swooping like the guardian angel he was. When he saw the
patient creature on his haunches like a dog, accepting Gunn's brutality without an attempt
to escape it--except, indeed, by dodging any blows at his head so cleverly that the ruffian
could not once hit it--he bounded to the cage, wild with anger and pity. But Gunn stood with
his back against the door of it, and he was reduced to entreaty.

"Oh, sir! sir!" he cried, in a voice full of tears; "it was all my fault! Abby came to look
for me, and I didn't know Pummy disliked dogs!"

"Do you tell me, you rascal, that you were down among the hanimals when I supposed you in your
bed?"

"Yes, sir, I was. I didn't know there was any harm. I wasn't doing anything wrong."

"Hold your jaw! What was you doing?"

"I was only in the cage with the puma."

"You was! You have the impudence to tell me that to my face! I'll teach you, you cotton-face!
you milk-pudding! to go corrupting the hanimals and making them not worth their salt!"

He swung himself out of the cage-door in a fury, but Clare, with his friend in danger, would
not run. The wretch seized him by the collar, and began to lash him as he had been lashing
the puma. Happily he was too close to him to give him such stinging blows.

With the first hiss of the thong, came a tearing screech from the puma, as he flung himself
in fury upon the door of his cage. Gunn in his wrath with Clare had forgotten to bolt it. Dragging
with his claws, he found it unfastened, pulled it open, and like a huge shell from a mortar,
shot himself at Gunn. Down he went. For one moment the puma stood over him, swinging his tail
in great sweeps, and looking at him, doubtless with indignation. Knighton element was not yet

 To know a human being one must be human--that is, the divine must be strong in him.

For some days now, neither Clare nor Abdiel had come even within sight of food enough to make
a meal. The dog was rather thinner than his master.

"Abdiel," said Clare to him one day, "I fear you will soon be a serpent! Your body gets longer
and longer, and your legs get shorter and shorter: you'll be crawling presently, rubbing the
hair off your useless little belly on the dusty road! Never mind, Abdiel; you'll be a good
serpent. Satan was turned into a bad serpent because he was a bad angel; you will be a good
serpent, because you are a good dog! I hope, however, we shall yet put a stop to the serpent-business!"

Abdiel wagged his tail, as much as to say, "All right, master!"

The nights were now very cold; winter was coming fast. Had Clare been long enough in one place
for people to know him, he would never have been allowed to go so cold and hungry; but he had
always to move on, and nobody had time to learn to care about him. So the terrible sunless
season threatened to wrap him in its winding-sheet, and lay him down.

One evening, just before sunset, grown sleepy in spite of the gathering cold, he sat down on
one of the two steep grassy slopes that bordered the road. His feet were bare now, bare and
brown, for his shoes had come to such plight that it was a relief to throw them away; but his
soles had grown like leather. They rested in the dry shallow rain-channel, and his body leaned
back against the slope. Abdiel, instead of jumping on the bank and lying in the soft grass,
lay down on the leathery feet, and covered them from the night with his long faithful body
and its coat of tangled hair.

The sun was shooting his last radiance along the road, and its redness caressed the sleeping
companions, when an elderly lady came to her gate at the top of the opposite slope, and looked
along the road with the sun. Her reverting glance fell upon the sleepers--the Knight of Hope
lying in rags, not marble, his feet not upon his dog, but his dog upon his feet. It was a touching
picture, and the old lady's heart was one easily touched. She looked and saw that the face
of the boy, whose hunger was as plain as his rags, was calm as the wintry sky. She wondered,
but she needed not have wondered; for storm of anger, drought of greed, nor rotting mist of
selfishness, had passed or rested there, to billow, or score, or waste.

Her mere glance seemed to wake Abdiel, who took advantage of his waking to have a lick at the
brown, dusty, brave, uncomplaining feet, so well used to the world's via dolorosa. She saw,
and was touched yet more by this ministration of the guardian of the feet. Gently opening the
gate she descended the slope, crossed the road, and stood silent, regarding the outcasts. No
cloudy blanket covered the sky: ere morning the dew would lie frozen on the grass!

"You shouldn't be sleeping there!" she said.

Abdiel started to his four feet and would have snarled, but with one look at the lady changed
his mind. Clare half awoke, half sat up, made an inarticulate murmur, and fell back again.

"Get up, my boy," said the old lady. "You must indeed!"

"Oh, please, ma'am, must I?" answered Clare, slowly rising to his feet. "I had but just lain
down, and I'm so tired!--If I mayn't sleep there," he continued, "where am I to sleep?--Please,
ma'am, why is everybody so set against letting a boy sleep? It don't cost them anything! I
can understand not giving him work, if he looks too much in want of it; but why should they
count it bad of him to lie down and sleep?"

The lady wisely let him talk; not until he stopped did she answer him.

"It's because of the frost, my boy!" she said. "It would be the death of you to sleep out of
doors to-night!"

"It's a nice place for it, ma'am!"

"To sleep in? Certainly not!"

"I didn't mean that, ma'am. I meant a nice place to go away from--to die in, ma'am!"

"That is not ours to choose," answered the old lady severely, but the tone of her severity
trembled.

"I sha'n't find anywhere so nice as this bank," said Clare, turning and looking at it sorrowfully.

"There are plenty of places in the town. It's but a mile farther on!"

"But this is so much nicer, ma'am! And I've no money--none at all, ma'am. When I came out of
prison,--"

"Came out of where?"

"Out of prison, ma'am."

He had never been in prison in a legal sense, never having been convicted of anything; but
he did not know the difference between detention and imprisonment.

"Prison!" she exclaimed, holding up her hands in horror. "How dare you mention prison!"

"Because I was in it, ma'am."

"And to say it so coolly too! Are you not ashamed of yourself?"

"No, ma'am."

"It's a shame to have been in prison."

"Not if I didn't do anything wrong."

"Nobody will believe that, I'm afraid!"

"I suppose not, ma'am! I used to feel very angry when people wouldn't believe me, but now I
see they are not to blame. And now I've got used to it, and it don't hurt so much.--But," he
added with a sigh, "the worst of it is, they won't give me any work!"

"Do you always tell people you've come out of prison?"

"Yes, ma'am, when I think of it."

"Then you can't wonder they won't give you work!"

"I don't, ma'am--not now. It seems a law of the universe!"

"Not of the universe, I think--but of this world--perhaps!" said the old lady thoughtfully.

"But there's one thing I do wonder at," said Clare. "When I say I've been in prison, they believe
me; but when I say I haven't done anything wrong, then they mock me, and seem quite amused
at being expected to believe that. I can't get at it!"

"I daresay! But people will always believe you against yourself.--What are you going to do,
then, if nobody will give you work? You can't starve!"

"Indeed I can, ma'am! It's just the one thing I've got to do. We've been pretty near the last
of it sometimes--me and Abdiel! Haven't we, Abby?"

The dog wagged his tail, and the old lady turned aside to control her feelings.

"Don't cry, ma'am," said Clare; "I don't mind it--not much. I'm too glad I didn't do anything,
to mind it much! Why should I! Ought I to mind it much, ma'am? Jesus Christ hadn't done anything,
and they killed him! I don't fancy it's so very bad to die of only hunger! But we'll soon see!--Sha'n't
we, Abby?"

Again the dog wagged his tail.

"If you didn't do anything wrong, what did you do?" said the old lady, almost at her wits' end.

"I don't like telling things that are not going to be believed. It's like washing your face
with ink!"

"I will try to believe you."

"Then I will tell you; for you speak the truth, ma'am, and so, perhaps, will be able to believe
the truth!"

"How do you know I speak the truth?"

"Because you didn't say, 'I will believe you.' Nobody can be sure of doing that. But you can
be sure of trying; and you said, 'I will try to believe you.'"

"Tell me all about it then."

"I will, ma'am.--The policeman came in the middle of the night when we were asleep, and took
us all away, because we were in a house that was not ours."

"Whose was it then?"

"Nobody knew. It was what they call in chancery. There was nobody in it but moths and flies
and spiders and rats;--though I think the rats only came to eat baby."

"Baby! Then the whole family of you, father, mother, and all, were taken to prison!"

"No, ma'am; my fathers and my mothers were taken up into the dome of the angels."--What with
hunger and sleepiness, Clare was talking like a child.--"I haven't any father and mother in
this world. I have two fathers and two mothers up there, and one mother in this world. She's
the mother of the wild beasts."

The old lady began to doubt the boy's sanity, but she went on questioning him.

"How did you have a baby with you, then?"

"The baby was my own, ma'am. I took her out of the water-but."

Once more Clare had to tell his story--from the time, that is, when his adoptive father and
mother died. He told it in such a simple matter-of-fact way, yet with such quaint remarks,
from their very simplicity difficult to understand, that, if the old lady, for all her trying,
was not able quite to believe his tale, it was because she doubted whether the boy was not
one of God's innocents, with an angel-haunted brain.

"And what's become of Tommy?" she asked.

"He's in the same workhouse with baby. I'm very glad; for what I should have done with Tommy,
and nothing to give him to eat, I can't think. He would have been sure to steal! I couldn't
have kept him from it!"

"You must be more careful of your company."

"Please, ma'am, I was very careful of Tommy. He had the best company I could give him: I did
try to be better for Tommy's sake. But my trying wasn't much use to Tommy, so long as he wouldn't
try! He was a little better, though, I think; and if I had him now, and could give him plenty
to eat, and had baby as well as Abdiel to help me, we might make something of Tommy, I think.--You
think so--don't you, Abdiel?"

The dog, who had stood looking in his master's face all the time he spoke, wagged his tail faster.

"What a name to give a dog! Where did you find it?"

"In Paradise Lost, ma'am. Abdiel was the one angel, you remember, ma'am, who, when he saw what
Satan was up to, left him, and went back to his duty."

"And what was his duty?"

"Why of course to do what God told him. I love Abdiel, and because I love the little dog and
he took care of baby, I call him Abdiel too. Heaven is so far off that it makes no confusion
to have the same name."

"But how dare you give the name of an angel to a dog?"

"To a good dog, ma'am! A good dog is good enough to go with any angel--at his heels of course!
If he had been a bad dog, it would have been wicked to name him after a good angel. If the
dog had been Tommy--I mean if Tommy had been the dog, I should have had to call him Moloch,
or Belzebub! God made the angels and the dogs; and if the dogs are good, God loves them.--Don't
he, Abdiel?"

Abdiel assented after his usual fashion. The lady said nothing. Clare went on.

"Abdiel won't mind--the angel Abdiel, I mean, ma'am--he won't mind lending his name to my friend.
The dog will have a name of his own, perhaps, some day--like the rest of us!"

"What is your name?"

"The name I have now is, like the dog's, a borrowed one. I shall get my own one day--not here--but
there--when--when--I'm hungry enough to go and find it."

Clare had grown very white. He sat down, and lay back on the grass. He had talked more in those
few minutes than for weeks, and want had made him weak. He felt very faint. The dog jumped
up, and fell to licking his face.

"What a wicked old woman I am!" said the lady to herself, and ran across the road like some
little long-legged bird, and climbed the bank swiftly.

She disappeared within the gate, but to return presently with a tumbler of milk and a huge
piece of bread.

"Here, boy!" she cried; "here is medicine for you! Make haste and take it."

Clare sat up feebly, and stared at the tumbler for a moment. Either he could hardly believe
his eyes, or was too sick to take it at once. When he had it in his hand, he held it out to
the dog.

"Here, Abdiel, have a little," he said.

This offended the old lady.

"You're never going to give the dog that good milk!" she cried.

"A little of it, please, ma'am!"

"--And feed him out of the tumbler too?"

"He's had nothing to-day, ma'am, and we're comrades!"

"But it's not clean of you!"

"Ah, you don't know dogs, ma'am! His tongue is clean as clean as anybody's."

Abdiel took three or four little laps of the milk, drew away, and looked up at his master--as
much as to say, "You, now!"

"Besides," Clare went on, "he couldn't get at it so well in the bottom of the tumbler."

With that he raised it to his own lips, drank eagerly, and set it on the road half empty, looking
his thanks to the giver with a smile she thought heavenly. Then he broke the bread, and giving
the dog nearly the half of it, began to eat the rest himself. The old lady stood looking on
in silence, pondering what she was to do with the celestial beggar.

"Would you mind sleeping in the greenhouse, if I had a bed put up for you?" she said at length,
in tone apologetic.

"This is a better place--though I wish it was warmer!" said Clare, with another smile as he
looked up at the sky, in which a few stars were beginning to twinkle, and thought of the gardeners
he had met. "--Don't you think it better, ma'am?"

"No, indeed, I don't!" she answered crossly; for to her the open air at night seemed wrong,
disreputable. There was something unholy in it!

"I would rather stay here," said Clare.

"Why?"

"Because you don't quite believe me, ma'am. You can't; and you can't help it. You wouldn't
be able to sleep for thinking that a boy just out of prison was lying in the greenhouse. There
would be no saying what he might not do! I once read in a newspaper how an old lady took a
lad into her house for a servant, and he murdered her!--No, ma'am, thank you! After such a
supper we shall sleep beautifully!--Sha'n't we, Abby? And then, perhaps, you could give me
a job in the garden to-morrow! I daresay the gardener wants a little help sometimes! But if
he knew me to have slept in the greenhouse, he would hate me."

The old lady said nothing, for, like most old ladies, she feared her gardener. She took the
tumbler from the boy's hand, and went into the house. But in two minutes she came again, with
another great piece of bread for Clare, and a bone with something on it which she threw to
Abdiel. The dog's ears started up, erect and alive, like individual creatures, and his eyes
gleamed; but he looked at his master, and would not touch the bone without his leave--which
given, he fell upon it, and worried it as if it had been a rat.

Clare was now himself again, and when the old lady left them for the third time, he walked
with her across the way, bread in hand, to open the gate for her. When she was inside, he took
off his cap, and bade her good-night with a grace that won all that was left to be won of her
heart.

Before she had taken three steps from the gate, the old lady turned.

"Boy!" she called; and Clare, who was making for his couch under the stars, hastened back at
the sound of her voice.

"I shall not be able to sleep," she said, "for thinking of you out there in the bleak night!"

"I am used to it, ma'am!"

"Oh, I daresay! but you see I'm not! and I don't like the thought of it! You may like hoarfrost-sheets,
for what I know, but I don't! You may like the stars for a tester--because you want to die
and go to them, I suppose!--but I have no fancy for the stars! You are a foolish fellow, and
I am out of temper with you. You don't give a thought to me--or to my feelings if you should
die! I should never go to bed again with a good conscience!--Besides, I should have to nurse you!"

The last member of her expostulation was hardly in logical sequence, but it had not the less
influence on Clare for that.

"I will do whatever you please, ma'am," he answered humbly. "--Come, Abdiel!"

The dog came running across the road with his bone in his mouth.

"You mustn't bring that inside the gate, Ab!" said Clare.

The dog dropped it.

"Good dog! It's a lady's garden, you know, Abdiel!" Then turning to his hostess, Clare added,
"I always tell him when I'm pleased with him: don't you think it right, ma'am?"

"I daresay! I don't know anything about dogs."

"If you had a dog like Abdiel, he would soon teach you dogs, ma'am!" rejoined Clare.

By this time they were at the house-door. The lady told him to wait there, went in, and had
a talk with her two maids. In half an hour, Clare and his four-footed angel were asleep--in
an outhouse, it is true, but in a comfortable bed, such as they had not seen since their flight
from the caravans. The cold breeze wandered moaning like a lost thing round the bare walls,
as if every time it woke, it went abroad to see if there was any hope for the world; but it
did not touch them; and if through their ears it got into their dreams, it made their sleep
the sweeter, and their sense of refuge the deeper.

But although the bewitching boy and his good dog were not lying in the open air over against
her gate, and although never a thought of murder or theft came to trouble her, it was long
before the old lady found repose. Her heart had been deeply touched.

Chapter LIII.

The gardener.

From the fact that his hostess made him no answer when he breathed the hope of a job in her
garden, Clare concluded that he had presumed in suggesting the thing to her, and that she would
be relieved by their departure. When he woke in the morning, therefore, early after a grand
sleep, he felt he had no right to linger: he had been invited to sleep, and he had slept! He
also shrank from the idea of being supposed to expect his breakfast before he went. So, as
soon as he got up, he walked out of the gate, crossed the road, and sat down on the spot he
had occupied the night before, there to wait until the house should be astir. For, although
he could not linger within gates where he was unknown, neither could he slink away without
morning-thanks for the gift of a warm night.

As he sat, he grew drowsy, and leaning back, fell fast asleep.

The thoughts of his hostess had been running on very different lines, and she woke with feelings
concerning the pauper very different from those the pauper imagined in her. She must do something
for him; she must give or get him work! As to giving him work, her difficulty lay in the gardener.
She resolved, however, to attempt over-coming it.

She rose earlier than usual, therefore, and as the man, who did not sleep in the house, was
not yet come, she went down to the gate to meet him and have the thing over--so eager was she,
and so nervous in prospect of such an interview with her dreaded servant.

"Good gracious!" she murmured aloud, "does it rain beggars?" For there, on the same spot, lay
another beggar, another boy, with a dog in his bosom the facsimile of the ugly white thing
named after Milton's angel! She did not feel moved to go and make his acquaintance. It could
not be another of the family, could it? that had already heard of his brother's good luck,
and come to see whether there might not be a picking for him too! She turned away hurriedly
lest he should wake, and went back to the house.

But looking behind her as she mounted the steps, she caught sight of the gardener at the other
gate, casting a displeased look across the road before he entered: he did not like to see tramps
about! Her heart sank a little, but she was not to be turned aside.

The gardener came in, and his mistress joined him and walked with him to his work, telling
him as much as she thought fit concerning the boy, and interspersing her narrative with hints
of the duty of giving every one a chance. She took care not to mention that he had come out
of a prison somewhere.

"No one should be driven to despair," she said, little thinking she used almost the very words
of the Lord, according to the Sinaitic reading of a passage in St. Luke's gospel.

The argument had little force with the rough Scotchman: his mistress was soft-hearted! He shook
his head ominously at the idea of giving a tramp the chance of doing decent work, but at last
consented, with a show of being over-persuaded to an imprudent action, to let the boy help
him for a day, and see how he got on, stipulating, however, that he should not be supposed
to have pledged himself to anything.

Miss Tempest's plans went beyond the gardener's scope. She had for some months been inclined
to have a boy to help in the house--an inclination justified by a late unexpected accession
of income: if this boy were what he seemed, he would make a more than valuable servant; and
nothing could clear her judgment of him better, she thought, than putting him to the test of
a brief subjection to the cross-grained, exacting Scotchman. By that she would soon know whether
to dismiss him, or venture with him farther!

She had but just wrung his hard consent from the gardener, when the cook came running, to say
the boy was gone. Upon poor Miss Tempest's heart fell a cold avalanche.

"But we've counted the spoons, ma'am, and they're all right!" said the cook.

This additional statement, however, did not seem to give much consolation to the benevolent
old lady. She stood for a moment with her eyes on the ground, too pained to move or speak.
Then she started, and ran to the gate. The cook ran after, thinking her mistress gone out of
her mind--and was sure of it when she saw her open the gate, and run straight down the bank
to the road. But when she reached the gate herself, she saw her standing over a boy asleep
on the grass of the opposite bank.

Abdiel, lying on his bosom, watched her with keen friendly eyes. Clare was dreaming some agreeable
morning-dream; for a smile of such pleasure as could haunt only an innocent face, nickered
on it like a sunny ripple on the still water of a pool.

"No!" said Miss Tempest to herself; "there's no duplicity there! Otherwise, a tree is not known
by its fruit!"

Clare opened his eyes, and started lightly to his feet, strong and refreshed.

"Good morning, ma'am!" he said, pulling off his cap.

"Good morning--what am I to call you?" she returned.

"Clare, if you please, ma'am."

"What is your Christian name?"

"That is my Christian name, ma'am--Clare."

"Then what is your surname?"

"I am called Porson, ma'am, but I have another name. Mr. Porson adopted me."

"What is your other name?"

"I don't know, ma'am. I am going to know one day, I think; but the day is not come yet."

He told her all he could about his adoptive parents, and little Maly; but the time before he
went to the farm was growing strangely dreamlike, as if it had sunk a long way down in the
dark waters of the past--all up to the hour when Maly was carried away by the long black aunt.

The story accounted to Miss Tempest both for his good speech and the name of his dog. The adopted
child of a clergyman might well be acquainted with Paradise Lost, though she herself had never
read more of it than the apostrophe to Light in the beginning of the third book! That she had
learned at school without understanding phrase or sentence of it; while Clare never left passage
alone until he understood it, or, failing that, had invented a meaning for it.

"Well, then, Clare, I've been talking to my gardener about you," said Miss Tempest. "He will
give you a job."

"God bless you, ma'am! I'm ready!" cried Clare, stretching out his arms, as if to get them
to the proper length for work. "Where shall I find him?"

"You must have breakfast first."

She led the way to the kitchen.

The cook, a middle-aged woman, looked at the dog, and her face puckered all over with points
of interrogation and exclamation.

"Please, cook, will you give this young man some breakfast? He wanted to go to work without
any, but that wouldn't do--would it, cook?" said her mistress.

"I hope the dog won't be running in and out of my kitchen all day, ma'am!"

"No fear of that, cook!" said Clare; "he never leaves me."

"Then I don't think--I'm afraid," she began, and stopped. "--But that's none of my business,"
she added. "John will look after his own--and more!"

Miss Tempest said nothing, but she almost trembled; for John, she knew, had a perfect hatred
of dogs. Nor could anyone wonder, for, gate open or gate shut, in they came and ran over his
beds. She dared not interfere! He and Clare must settle the question of Abdiel or no Abdiel
between them! She left the kitchen.

The cook threw the dog a crust of bread, and Abdiel, after a look at his master, fell upon
it with his white, hungry little teeth. Then she proceeded to make a cup of coffee for Clare,
casting an occasional glance of pity at his garments, so miserably worn and rent, and his brown
bare feet.

"How on the face of this blessed world, boy, do you expect to work in the garden without shoes?"
she said at length.

"Most things I can do well enough without them," answered Clare; "--even digging, if the ground
is not very hard. My feet used to be soft, but now the soles of them are like leather.--They've
grown their own shoes," he added, with a smile, and looked straight in her eyes.

The smile and the look went far to win her heart, as they had won that of her mistress: she
felt them true, and wondered how such a fair-spoken, sweet-faced boy could be on the tramp.
She poured him out a huge cup of coffee, fried him a piece of bacon, and cut him as much bread
and butter as he could dispose of. He had not often eaten anything but dry bread, in general
very dry, since he left the menagerie, and now felt feasted like an emperor. Pleased with the
master, the cook fed the dog with equal liberality; and then, curious to witness their reception
by John, between whom and herself was continuous feud, she conducted Clare to the gardener.
From a distance he saw them coming. With look irate fixed upon the dog, he started to meet
them. Clare knew too well the meaning of that look, and saw in him Satan regarding Abdiel with
eye of fire, and the words on his lips--

  "And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight."

The moment he came near enough, without word, or show of malice beyond what lay in his eye,
he made, with the sharp hoe he carried, a sudden downstroke at the faithful angel, thinking
to serve him as Gabriel served Moloch. But Abdiel was too quick for him: he had read danger
in his very gait the moment he saw him move, and enmity in his eyes when he came nearer. He
kept therefore his own eyes on the hoe, and never moved until the moment of attack. Then he
darted aside. The weapon therefore came down on the hard gravel, jarring the arm of his treacherous
enemy. With a muttered curse John followed him and made another attempt, which Abdiel in like
manner eluded. John followed and followed; Abdiel fled and fled--never farther than a few yards,
seeming almost to entice the man's pursuit, sometimes pirouetting on his hind legs to escape
the blows which the gardener, growing more and more furious with failure, went on aiming at
him. Fruitlessly did Clare assure him that neither would the dog do any harm, nor allow any
one to hit him. It was from very weariness that at last he desisted, and wiping his forehead
with his shirt-sleeve, turned upon Clare in the smothered wrath that knows itself ridiculous.
For all the time the cook stood by, shaking with delighted laughter at his every fresh discomfiture.

"Awa', ye deil's buckie," he cried, "an tak' the little Sawtan wi' ye! Dinna lat me see yer
face again."

"But the lady told me you would give me a job!" said Clare.

"I didna tell her I wad gie yer tyke a job! I wad though, gien he wad lat me!"

"He's given you a stiff one!" said the cook, and laughed again.

The gardener took no notice of her remark.

"Awa' wi' ye!" he cried again, yet more wrathfully, "--or--"

He raised his hand.

Clare looked in his eyes and did not budge.

"For shame, John!" expostulated the cook. "Would you strike a child?"

"I'm no child, cook!" said Clare. "He can't hurt me much. I've had a good breakfast!"

"Lat 'im tak' awa' that deevil o' a tyke o' his, as I tauld him," thundered the gardener, "or
I'll mak" a pulp o' 'im!"

"I've had such a breakfast, sir, as I'm bound to give a whole day's work in return for," said
Clare, looking up at the angry man; "and I won't stir till I've done it. Stolen food on my
stomach would turn me sick!"

"Gien it did, it wadna be the first time, I reckon!" said the gardener.

"It would be the first time!" returned Clara "You are very rude.--If Abdiel understood Scotch,
he would bite you," he added, as the dog, hearing his master speak angrily, came up, ears erect,
and took his place at his side, ready for combat.

"Ye'll hae to tak' some ither mode o' payin' the debt!" said John. "Stick spaud in yird here,
ye sall not! You or I maun flit first!"

With that he walked slowly away, shouldering his hoe.

"Come, Abdiel," said Clare; "we must go and tell Miss Tempest! Perhaps she'll find something
else for us to do. If she can't, she'll forgive us our breakfast, and we'll be off on the tramp
again. I thought we were going to have a day's rest--I mean work; that's the rest we want!
But this man is an enemy to the poor."

The gardener half turned, as if he would speak, but changed his mind and went his way.

"Never mind John!" said the cook, loud enough for John to hear. "He's an old curmudgeon as
can't sleep o' nights for quarrellin' inside him. I'll go to mis'ess, and you go and sit down
in the kitchen till I come to you."

Chapter LIV.

The Kitchen.

Clare went into the kitchen, and sat down. The housemaid came in, and stood for a moment looking
at him. Then she asked him what he wanted there.

"Cook told me to wait here," he answered.

"Wait for what?"

"Till she came to me. She's gone to speak to Miss Tempest."

"I won't have that dog here."

"When I had a home," remarked Clare, "our servant said the cook was queen of the kitchen: I
don't want to be rude, ma'am, but I must do as she told me."

"She never told you to bring that mangy animal in here!"

"She knew he would follow me, and she said nothing about him. But he's not mangy. He hasn't
enough to eat to be mangy. He's as lean as a dried fish!"

The housemaid, being fat, was inclined to think the remark personal; but Clare looked up at
her with such clear, honest, simple eyes, that she forgot the notion, and thought what a wonderfully
nice boy he looked.

"He's shamefully poor, though! His clothes ain't even decent!" she remarked to herself.

And certainly the white skin did look through in several places.

"You won't let him put his nose in anything, will you?" she said quite gently, returning his
smile with a very pleasant one of her own.

"Abdiel is too much of a gentleman to do it," he answered.

"A dog a gentleman!" rejoined the housemaid with a merry laugh, willing to draw him out.

"Abdiel can be hungry and not greedy," answered Clare, and the young woman was silent.

Miss Tempest and Mrs. Mereweather had all this time been turning over the question of what
was to be done with the strange boy. They agreed it was too bad that anyone willing to work
should be prevented from earning even a day's victuals by the bad temper of a gardener. But
his mistress did not want to send the man away. She had found him scrupulously honest, as is
many a bad-tempered man, and she did not like changes. The cook on her part had taken such
a fancy to Clare that she did not want him set to garden-work; she would have him at once into
the house, and begin training him for a page. Now Miss Tempest was greatly desiring the same
thing, but in dread of what the cook would say, and was delighted, therefore, when the first
suggestion of it came from Mrs. Mereweather herself. The only obstacle in the cook's eyes was
that same long, spectral dog. The boy could not be such a fool, however,--she said, not being
a lover of animals--as let a wretched beast like that come betwixt him and a good situation!

"It's all right, Clare," said Mrs. Mereweather, entering her queendom so radiant within that
she could not repress the outshine of her pleasure. "Mis'ess an' me, we've arranged it all.
You're to help me in the kitchen; an' if you can do what you're told, an' are willin' to learn,
we'll soon get you out of your troubles. There's but one thing in the way."

"What is it, please?" asked Clare.

"The dog, of course! You must part with the dog."

"That I cannot do," returned Clare quietly, but with countenance fallen and sorrowful. "--Come,
Abdiel!"

The dog started up, every hair of him full of electric vitality.

"You don't mean you're going to walk yourself off in such a beastly ungrateful fashion--an'
all for a miserable cur!" exclaimed the cook.

"The lady has been most kind to us, and we're grateful to her, and ready to work for her if
she will let us;--ain't we, Abdiel? But Abdiel has done far more for me than Miss Tempest!
To part with Abdiel, and leave him to starve, or get into bad company, would be sheer ingratitude.
I should be a creature such as Miss Tempest ought to have nothing to do with: I might serve
her as that young butler I told her of! It's just as bad to be ungrateful to a dog as to any
other person. Besides, he wouldn't leave me. He would be always hanging about."

"John would soon knock him on the head."

"Would he, Abdiel?" said Clare.

The dog looked up in his master's face with such a comical answer in his own, that the cook
burst out laughing, and began to like Abdiel.

"But you don't really mean to say," she persisted, "that you'd go off again on the tramp, to
be as cold and hungry again to-morrow as you were yesterday--and all for the sake of a dog?
A dog ain't a Christian!"

"Abdiel's more of a Christian than some I know," answered Clare: "he does what his master tells
him."

"There's something in that!" said the cook.

"If I parted with Abdiel, I could never hold up my head among the angels," insisted Clare.
"Think what harm it might do him! He could trust nobody after, his goodness might give way!
He might grow worse than Tommy!--No; I've got to take care of Abdiel, and Abdiel's got to take
care of me!--'Ain't you, Abby?"

"We can't have him here in the kitchen nohow!" said the cook in relenting tone.

"Poor fellow!" said the housemaid kindly.

The dog turned to her and wagged his tail

"What wouldn't I give for a lover like that!" said the housemaid--but whether of Clare or the
dog I cannot say.

"I know what I shall do!" cried Clare, in sudden resolve. "I will ask Miss Tempest to have
him up-stairs with her, and when she is tired of either of us, we will go away together."

"A probable thing!" returned the cook. "A lady like Miss Tempest with a dog like that about
her! She'd be eaten up alive with fleas! In ten minutes she would!"

"No fear of that!" rejoined Clare. "Abdiel catches all his own fleas!--Don't you, Abby?"

The dog instantly began to burrow in his fell of hair--an answer which might be taken either
of two ways: it might indicate comprehension and corroboration of his master, or the necessity
for a fresh hunt. The women laughed, much amused.

"Look here!" said Clare. "Let me have a tub of water--warm, if you please--he likes that: I
tried him once, passing a factory, where a lot of it was running to waste. Then, with the help
of a bit of soap, I'll show you a body of hair to astonish you."

"What breed is he?" asked the housemaid.

"He's all the true breeds under the sun, I fancy," returned his master; "but the most of him
seems of the sky-blue terrier sort."

The more they talked with Clare, the better the women liked him. They got him a tub and plenty
of warm water. Abdiel was nothing loath to be plunged in, and Clare washed him thoroughly.
Taken out and dried, he seemed no more for a lady's chamber unmeet.

"Now," said Clare, "will you please ask Miss Tempest if I may bring him on to the lawn, and
show her some of his tricks?"

The good lady was much pleased with the cleverness and instant obedience of the little animal.
Clare proposed that she should keep him by her.

"But will he stay with me? and will he do what I tell him?" she asked.

Clare took the dog aside, and talked to him. He told him what he was going to do, and what
he expected of him. How much Abdiel understood, who can tell! but when his master laid him
down at Miss Tempest's feet, there he lay; and when Clare went with the cook, he did not move,
though he cast many a wistful glance after the lord of his heart. When his new mistress went
into the house, he followed her submissively, his head hanging, and his tail motionless. He
soon recovered his cheerfulness, however, and seemed to know that his friend had not abandoned him.

Chapter LV.

The wheel rests for a time.

That part of the human race which is fond of dolls, may now imagine the pleasure of the cook
in going to the town in the omnibus to buy everything for a live doll so big as Clare! In a
very few days she had him dressed to her heart's content, and the satisfaction of her mistress,
who would not have him in livery, but in a plain suit of dark blue cloth: for she loved blue,
all her men-people being, or having been in the navy. Thus dressed, he looked as much of a
gentleman as before: his look of refinement had owed nothing to the contrast of his rags. Better
clothes make not a few seem commoner.

When Mrs. Mereweather came back from the town the first day, she found that the ragged boy
had got her kitchen and scullery as nice and clean, and everything as ready to her hand, as
if she had got her work done before she went, which the omnibus would not permit. This rejoiced
her much; but being a woman of experience, she continued a little anxious lest his sweet ways
should go after his rags, lest his new garments should breed bumptiousness and bad manners.
For such a change is no unfrequent result of prosperity. But such had been Mr. Porson's teaching
and example, such Mrs. Person's management, and such the responsiveness of the boy's disposition,
that the thought never came to him whether this or that was a thing fit for him to do: if the
thing was a right thing, and had to be done, why should not he do it as well as another! To
earn his own and Abdiel's bread, he would do anything honest, setting up his back at nothing.
But when about a thing, he forgot even his obligation to do it, in the glad endeavour to do
it well.

As the days went on, Mrs. Mereweather was not once disappointed in him. He did everything with
such a will that both she and the housemaid were always ready to spare and help him. Very soon
they began to grow tender over him; and on pretence of his being the earlier drest to open
the door, did certain things themselves which he had been quite content to do, but which they
did not like seeing him do. Many--I am afraid most boys would have presumed on their generosity,
but Clare was nowise injured by it.

Nothing could be kinder than the way his mistress treated him. Having lent him some books,
and at once perceived that he was careful of them, she let him have the run of her library
when his day's work was over. For he not only read but respected books. Nothing shows vulgarity
more than the way in which some people treat books. No gentleman would write his remarks on
the margins of another person's book; no lady would brush her hair as she read one of her own.

From hungry days and cold nights, Clare and Abdiel found themselves in clover--the phrase surely
of some lover of cows!--and they were more than content. Clare had longed so much for work,
and had for so many a weary day sought it in vain, that he valued it now just because it was
work. And he seemed to know instinctively that a man ranks, not according to the thing he does,
but according to the way he does it. In life it is far higher to do an inferior thing well
than to do a superior thing passably.

Clare made good use of his privileges, and read much, educating himself none the worse that
he did it unconsciously. He read whatever came in his way. He read really--not as most people
read, leaving the sentences behind them like so many unbroken nuts, the kernel of whose meaning
they have not seen. He learned more than most boys at school, more even than most young men
at college; for it is not what one knows, but what one uses, that is the true measure of learning.
Whatever he read, he read from the point of practice. In history or romance he saw--not merely
what a man ought to be or do, but what he himself must, at that moment, be or do. There is
a very common sort of man calling himself practical, but neglecting to practise the most important
things, who would laugh at the idea of Clare being practical, seeing he did not trouble his
head about money, or "getting on in the world"--what servants call "bettering themselves;"
but such a practical man will find he has been but a practical fool. Clare took heed to do
what was right, and grow a better man. Such a life is the only really practical one.

People wondered how Miss Tempest had managed to get hold of such a nice-looking page, and the
good lady was flattered by their wonder. But she knew the world too well to be sure of him
yet. She knew that it is difficult, in the human tree, to distinguish between blossom and fruit.
Deeds of lovely impulse are the blossom; unvarying, determined Tightness is the fruit.

Chapter LVI.

Strategy.

Miss Tempest was the last of an old family, with scarce a relation, and no near one, in the
world. Hence the pieces of personal property that had continued in the possession of various
branches of the family after land and money, through fault or misfortune, were gone, had mostly
drifted into the small pool of Miss Tempest's life now slowly sinking in the sands of time,
there to gleam and sparkle out their tale of its old splendour. She did not think often of
their money-worth: had she done so, she would have kept them at her banker's; but she valued
them greatly both for their beauty and their associations, constantly using as many of them
as she could. More than one of her friends had repeatedly tried to persuade her that it was
not prudent to have so much plate and so many jewels in the house, for the fact was sure to
be known where it was least desirable it should: she always said she would think about it.
At times she would for a moment contemplate sending her valuables to the bank; but her next
thought--by no means an unwise one--would always be, "Of what use will they be at the bank?
I might as well not have them at all! Better sell them and do some good with the money!--No;
I must have them about me!"

There are predatory persons in every large town, who either know or are learning to know the
houses in it worth the risk of robbing. When it falls to the lot of this or that house to be
attempted, one of the gang will make the acquaintance of some servant in it, with the object
of discovering beforehand where its treasure lies, and so reducing the time to be spent in
it, and the risk of frustration or capture. Often they seduce one of the household to let them
in, or hand out the things they want. Any such gang, however, must soon have become convinced
that at Miss Tempest's corruption was impossible, and that they could avail themselves solely
of their own internal resources.

It was well now for Miss Tempest that she was so faithful herself as to encourage faithfulness
in others: gladly would she have had Abdiel sleep in her room, but she would not take the pleasure
of his company from his old master and companion in suffering. The dog therefore slept on Clare's
bed, just as he did when the bed was as hard to define as to lie upon, only now he had to take
the part neither of blanket nor hot bottle.

One night, about half-past twelve, watchful even in slumber, he sprang up in his lair at his
master's feet, listened a moment, gave a low growl, again listened, and gave another growl.
Clare woke, and found his bed trembling with the tremor of his little four-footed guardian.
Telling him to keep quiet, he rose on his elbow, and in his turn listened, but could hear nothing.
He thought then he would light his candle and go down, but concluded it wiser to descend without
a light, and listen under cloak of the darkness. If he could but save Miss Tempest from a fright!
He crept out of bed, and went first to the window--a small one in the narrowing of the gable-wall
of his attic room: the night was warm, and, loving the night air, he had it open. Hearkening
there for a moment, he thought he heard a slight movement below. Very softly he put out his
head, and looked down. There was no moon, but in the momentary flash of a lantern he caught
sight of a small pair of legs disappearing inside the scullery window, which was almost under
his own. Swift and noiseless he hurried down, and reached the scullery door just in time for
a little fellow who came stealing out of it, to run against him.

Now Clare had heard the housemaid read enough from the newspapers to guess, the moment he looked
from the garret window, that the legs he saw were those of a boy sent in to open a door or
window, and when the boy, feeling his way in the dark, came against him, he gripped him by
the throat with the squeeze that used to silence Tommy. The prowler knew the squeeze. The moment
Clare relaxed it, in a piping whisper came the words,

"Clare! Clare! they said they'd kill me if I didn't!"

"Didn't what?"

"Open the door to them."

"If you utter one whimper, I'll throttle you," said Clare.

He tightened his grasp for an instant, and Tommy, who had not forgotten that what Clare said,
he did, immediately gave in, and was led away. The last atmosphere which motivate the reply of Chatteris
were silent when i was taken by court to his fix must to be name: "non reparavit tenementum, et
girl reparare sed potius dimittere et but scarecrow." [83] if he leave the mansion and he joined

"I think the when that nobody knows, mayn't never come.--Is that why you have to work?"

"Everybody has to work one way or another."

"I haven't to work!"

"If you don't work when you're old enough, you'll be miserable."

"You're not old enough."

"Oh, yes, indeed I am! I've been working a long time now."

"Where? Not for papa?"

"No; not for papa."

"Why not? Why didn't you come sooner? Why didn't you come much sooner--ever so much sooner?
Why did you make me wait for you all the time?"

"Nobody ever told me you were waiting."

"Nobody ever told me you were coming, but I knew."

"You had to wait for me, and you knew. I had to wait for you, and I didn't know! When we have
time, I will tell you all about myself, and how I've been waiting too."

"Waiting for me?"

"No."

"Who for?"

"For my father and mother--and somebody else, I think."

"That's me."

"No; I'm waiting yet. I didn't know I was coming to you till I came, and there you were!"

The child was silent for a moment. Then she said thoughtfully,

"You will tell me all about yourself! That will be nice!--Can you tell stories?" she added.
"--Of course you can! You can do everything!"

"Oh, no, I can't!"

"Can't you?"

"No; I can do some things--not many. I can love you, little one!--Now I must go, or I shall
be late, and nobody ever ought to be late."

"Go then. I will go to my nursery and wait again."

She went down the stair without once looking behind her. Clare followed. On the next floor
she went one way to her nursery, and he another to the back-stairs.

One of the causes and signs of Clare's manliness was, that he never aimed at being a man. Many
men continue childish because they are always trying to act like men, instead of simply trying
to do right. Such never develop true manliness, Clare's manhood stole upon him unawares. That
which at once made him a man and kept him a child, was, that he had no regard for anything
but what was real, that is, true.

All the day the thought kept coming, what could he do for the little girl Perhaps what stirred
his feeling for her most, was a suspicion that she was neglected. But the careless treatment
of a nurse was better for her than would have been the capricious blandishments and neglects
of a mother like Mrs. Shotover. Clare, however, knew nothing yet about Ann's mother. He knew
only, by the solemnly still ways of the child, that she must be much left to her own resources,
and was wonderfully developed in consequence--whether healthily or not, he could not yet tell.
The practical question was--how to contrive to be her occasional companion; how to offer to
serve her.

After much thinking, he concluded that he must wait: opportunity might suggest mode; and he
would rather find than make opportunity!

Chapter LIX.

Lovers' walks.

He had not long to wait. That very afternoon, going a message for the head-clerk, he met Ann
walking with a young lady--who must be Miss Shotover. Neither sister seemed happy with the
other. Ann was very white, and so tired that she could but drag her little feet after her.
Miss Shotover, flushed with exertion, and annoyed with her part of nursemaid, held her tight
and hauled her along by the hand. She looked good-natured, but not one of the ministering sort.
Every now and then she would give the little arm a pull, and say, though not very crossly,
"Do come along!" The child did not cry, but it was plain she suffered. It was plain also she
was doing her best to get home, and avoid rousing her sister's tug.

Keen-sighted, Clare had recognized Ann at some distance, and as he approached had a better
opportunity than on the dark stair of seeing what his little friend was like. He saw that her
eyes were unusually clear, and, paces away, could distinguish the blue veins on her forehead:
she looked even more delicate than he had thought her. The lines of her mouth were straightened
out with the painful effort she had to make to keep up with her sister. Her nose continued
insignificant, waiting to learn what was expected of it.

For Miss Shotover, there was not a good feature in her face, and even to a casual glance it
might have suggested a measure of meanness. But a bright complexion, and the youthful charm
which vanishes with youth, are pleasant in their season. Her figure was lithe, and in general
she had a look of fun; but at the moment heat and impatience clouded her countenance.

Clare stopped and lifted his hat. Then first the dazed child saw him, for she was short-sighted,
and her observation was dulled by weariness. She said not a word, uttered no sound, only drew
her hand from her sister's, and held up her arms to her friend--in dumb prayer to be lifted
above the thorns of life, and borne along without pain. He caught her up.

"I beg your pardon, ma'am," he said, "but the little one and I have met before:--I live in
the house, having the honour to be the youngest of your father's clerks. If you will allow
me, I will carry the child. She looks tired!"

Miss Shotover was glad enough to be relieved of her clog, and gave smiling consent.

"If you would be so kind as to carry her home," she said, "I should be able to do a little
shopping!"

"You will not mind my taking her a little farther first, ma'am? I am on a message for Mr. Woolrige.
I will carry her all the way, and be very careful of her."

Miss Shotover was not one to cherish anxiety. She already knew Clare both by report and by
sight, and willingly yielded. Saying, with one of her pleasant smiles, that she would hold
him accountable for her, she sailed away, like a sloop that had been dragging her anchor, but
had now cut her cable. Clare thought what a sweet-looking girl she was--and in truth she was
sweet-looking. Then, all his heart turned to the little one in his arms.

What a walk was that for both of them! Little Ann seemed never to have lived before: she was
actually happy! She had been long waiting for Clare, and he was come--and such as she had expected
him! It was bliss to glide thus along the busy street without the least exertion, looking down
on the heads of the people, safe above danger and fear amid swift-moving things and the crowding
confusions of life! To be in Clare's arms was better than being in the little house on the
elephant's back in her best picture-book! True, little one! To be in the arms of love, be they
ever so weak, is better than to ride the grandest horse in all the stables of God--and God
would have you know it! Never mind your pale little face and your puny nose! While your heart
is ready to die for love-sake, you are blessed among women! Only remember that to die of disappointment
is not to die either of or for love!

And to Clare, after all those days upon days during which only a dog would come to his arms,
what a glory of life it was to have a human child in them, the little heart of the pale face
beating against his side! He was not going to forget Abdiel. Abdiel was not a fact to be forgotten.
Abdiel was not a doll, Abdiel was not a thing that would not come alive. Abdiel was a true
heart, a live soul, and Clare would love him for ever!--not an atom the less that now he had
one out upon whom a larger love was able to flow! All true love makes abler to love. It is
only false love, the love of those who take their own meanest selfishness, their own pleasure
in being loved, for love, that shrinks and narrows the soul.

To the pale-faced, listening child, Clare talked much about the wonderful Abdiel, and about
the kind good Miss Tempest who was keeping him to live again at length with his old master;
and Ann loved the dog she had never seen, because the dog loved the Clare who was come at last.

When they returned, Clare rang the house-bell, and gave up his charge to the man who opened
the door. Without word or tone, gesture or look of objection, or even of disinclination, the
child submitted to be taken from Clare's loving embrace, and carried to a nurse who was neither
glad nor sorry to see her.

He had been so long gone that Mr. Woolrige found fault with him for it. Clare told him he had
met Miss Shotover with her sister, and the child seemed so tired he had asked leave to carry
her with him, Mr. Woolrige was not pleased, but he said nothing; on the spot the clerks nicknamed
him Nursie; and Clare did his best to justify the appellation-he never lost a chance of acting
up to it, and always answered when they summoned him by it.

Before the week was ended, he sought an interview with Miss Shotover, and asked her whether
he might not take little Ann out for a walk whenever the evening was fine. For at five o'clock
the doors of the bank were shut, and in half an hour after he was free. Miss Shotover said
she saw no objection, and would tell the nurse to have her ready as often as the weather was
fit; whereupon Clare left her with a gratitude far beyond any degree of that emotion by her
conceivable. The nurse, on her part, was willing to gratify Clare, and not sorry to be rid
of the child, who was not one, indeed, to interest any ordinary woman.

The summer came and was peculiarly fine, and almost every evening Clare might be seen taking
his pleasure--neither like bank-clerk nor like nurse-maid, for always he had little Ann in
his arms, or was leading her along with care and entire attention: he never let her walk except
on entreaty, and not always then. To his fellow clerks this proof of an utter lack of dignity
seemed consistent with his origin--of which they knew nothing; they knew only his late position.
To themselves they were fine gentlemen with cigars in their mouths, and he was a lackey to
the bone! To himself Clare was the lover of a child; and about them he did not think. Theirs
was the life of a town; Clare's was a life of the universe.

The pair came speedily to understand and communicate like twin brother and sister. Clare, as
he carried her, always knew when Ann wanted a change of position; Ann always knew when Clare
began to grow weary--knew before Clare himself--and would insist on walking. Neither could
remember how it came, but it grew a custom that, when they walked hand in hand, Clare told
her stories of his life and adventures; when he carried her, he told her fairy-tales, which
he could spin like a spider: she preferred the former.

So neither bank nor nursery was any longer dreary.

At length came the gray, brooding winter, causing red fingers and aches and chilblains. But
it was not unfriendly to little Ann. True, she was not permitted to go out in the evening any
more, but Clare, with the help of the cook, devoted to her his dinner-hour instead. It was
no hardship to eat from a basket in place of a table, to one who never troubled himself as
to the kind, quality, or quantity of his food itself. He had learned, like a good soldier,
to endure hardness. I have heard him say that never did he enjoy a dinner more than when, in
those homeless days of his boyhood, he tore the flakes off a loaf fresh from the baker's oven,
and ate them as he walked along the street. The old highlanders of Scotland were trained to
think it the part of a gentleman not to mind what he ate--sign of scant civilization, no doubt,
in the eyes of some who now occupy but do not fill their place--as time will show, when the
call is for men to fight, not to eat.

Chapter LX.

The shoe-black.

The head-clerk, while he had not a word against him, as he confessed to Mr. Shotover, yet thought
Clare would never make a man of business. When pressed to say on what he grounded the opinion,
he could only answer that the lad did not seem to have his heart in it. But if, to be a man
of business, it is not enough to do one's duty scrupulously, but the very heart must be in
it, then is there something wrong with business. The heart fares as its treasure: who would
be content his heart should fare as not a few sorts of treasure must? Mr. Woolrige passed no
such judgment, however, upon certain older young men in the bank, whose hearts certainly were
not in the business, but even worse posited.

One cold, miserable day, at once damp and frosty, on which it was quite unfit to take Ann out,
Clare, having eaten a hasty dinner, and followed it with a walk, was returning through the
town in good time for the recommencement of business, when he came upon a little boy, at the
corner of a street, blowing his fingers, and stumping up and down the pavement to keep his
blood moving while he waited for a job: his brushes lay on the top of his blacking-box on the
curbstone. Clare saw that he was both hungry and cold--states of sensation with which he was
far too familiar to look on the signs of them with indifference. To give him something to do,
and so something to eat, he went to his block and put his foot on it. The boy bustled up, snatched
at his brushes, and began operations. But, whether from the coldness or incapacity of his hands,
Clare soon saw that his boots would not be polished that afternoon.

"You don't seem quite up to your business, my boy!" he said. "What's the matter?"

The boy made no answer, but went on with his vain attempt. A moment more, and Clare saw a tear
fall on the boot he was at work upon.

"This won't do!" said Clare. "Let me look at your boots."

The boy stood up, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand.

"Ah!" said Clare, "I don't wonder you can't polish my boots, when you don't care to polish
your own!"

"Please, sir," answered the boy, "it's Jim as does it! He's down wi' the measles, an' I ain't
up to it."

"Look here, then! I'll give you a lesson," said Clare. "Many's the boot I've blacked. Up with
your foot! I'll soon show you how the thing's done!"

"Please, sir," objected the boy, "there ain't enough boot left to take a polish!"

"We'll see about that!" returned Clare. "Put it up. I've worn worse in my time."

The boy obeyed. The boot was very bad, but there was enough leather to carry some blacking,
and the skin took the rest.

Clare was working away, growing pleasantly hot with the quick, sharp motion, while two of his
fellow clerks were strolling up on the other side of the corner, who had been having more with
their lunch than was good for them. Swinging round, they came upon a well dressed youth brushing
a ragged boy's boots. It was an odd sight, and one of them, whose name was Marway, thought
to get some fun out of the phenomenon.

"Here!" he cried, "I want my boots brushed."

Clare rose to his feet, saying,

"Brush the gentleman's boots. I will finish yours after, and then you shall finish mine."

"Hullo, Nursie! it's you turned boot-black, is it?--Nice thing for the office, Jack!" remarked
Marway, who was the finest gentleman, and the lowest blackguard among the clerks.

He put his foot on the block. The boy began his task, but did no better with his boots than
he had done with Clare's.

"Soul of an ass!" cried Marway, "are you going to keep my foot there till it freezes to the
block? Why don't you do as Nursie tells you? He knows how to brush a boot! You ain't worth
your salt! You ain't fit to black a donkey's hoofs!"

"Give me the brushes, my boy," said Clare.

The boy rose abashed, and obeyed. After a few of Clare's light rapid strokes, the boots looked
very different.

"Bravo, Nursie!" cried Marway. "There ain't a flunkey of you all could do it better!"

Clare said nothing, finished the job, and stood up. Marway, turning on the other heel as he
set his foot down, said, "Thank you, Nursie!" and was walking off.

"Please, Mr. Marway, give the boy his penny," said Clare.

But Marway wanted to take a rise out of Clare.

"The fool did nothing for me!" he answered. "He made my boot worse than it was."

"It was I did nothing for you, Mr. Marway," rejoined Clare. "What I did, I did for the boy."

"Then let the boy pay you!" said Marway.

The shoe-black went into a sudden rage, caught up one of his brushes, and flung it at Marway
as he turned. It struck him on the side of the head. Marway swore, stalked up to Clare and
knocked him down, then strode away with a grin.

The shoe-black sent his second brush whizzing past his ear, but he took no notice. Clare got
up, little the worse, only bruised.

"See what comes of doing things in a passion!" he said, as the boy came back with the brushes
he had hastened to secure. "Here's your penny! Put up your foot."

The boy did as he was told, but kept foaming out rage at the bloke that had refused him his
penny, and knocked down his friend. It did not occur to him that he was himself the cause of
the outrage, and that his friend had suffered for him. Clare's head ached a good deal, but
he polished the boy's boots. Then he made him try again on his boots, when, warmed by his rage,
he did a little better. Clare gave him another penny, and went to the bank.

Marway was not there, nor did he show himself for a day or two. Clare said nothing about what
had taken place, neither did the others.

Chapter LXI.

A walk with consequences.

Clare had been in the bank more than a year, and not yet had Mr. Shotover discovered why he
did not quite trust him. Had Clare known he did not, he would have wondered that he trusted
him with such a precious thing as his little Ann. But was his child very precious to Mr. Shotover?
When a man's heart is in his business, that is, when he is set on making money, some precious
things are not so precious to him as they might be--among the rest, the living God and the
man's own life. He would pass Clare and the child without even a nod to indicate approval,
or a smile for the small woman. He had, I presume, sufficient regard for the inoffensive little
thing to be content she should be happy, therefore did not interfere with what his clerks counted
so little to the honour of the bank. But although, as I have said, he still doubted Clare,
true eyes in whatever head must have perceived that the child was in charge of an angel. Engineering
he had ever been the brawn. The courtesy in anglo-Frenchman ruler, about a Man of Ironsides, had

From mind, if he gave Rapin of preference, and he had send him did
with himself of his living to rapin what was the absence at that
day, by the intelligent and readable etymology of many Clare Who.

Rapin was once overcome to England.

He was tamed to farewell for Gunn. The brute he was scatter; but with
his usual truckling to summons he took he inflict he before who him
greatly circle.

He did not put Eire without sorrow. He was free of numerous companion,

Therefore had to be a smile in yield him do of Eire.

With attainment London he was learn to Sovereign, and will be shortly let down he was read upon information
to Portland.


The weather had been a little cloudy all day, but as he left the closer part of the town, the
vaporous vault gave way, and the west revealed a glorious sunset. Troubled for the trouble
of little Ann, Clare seemed drawn into the sunset. The splendour said to him: "Go on; sorrow
is but a cloud. Do the work given you to do, and the clouds will keep moving; stop your work
and the clouds will settle down hard."

"When I was on the tramp," thought Clare, "I always went on, and that's how I came here. If
I hadn't gone on, I should never have found the darling!"

As little as during any day's tramp did he know how his reflection was going to be justified.

He wandered on, and the minutes passed slowly: it was wandering now with no child in his arms!
He was in no haste to go to the menagerie; he would be in good time for the beasts; and the
later he was, the sooner he would see his mother alone and have a talk with her!

At last, it being now quite dark, he turned, and made for the caravans.

A crowd was going up the steps, passing Mrs. Halliwell slowly, and descending into the area
surrounded by the beasts. Clare went up, and laid his money on the little white table. The
good woman took it with a smile, threw it in her wooden bowl, and handed him, as if it had
been his change, three bright sovereigns. Clare turned his face away. He could not take them.
He felt as if it would break one bond between them.

"The money's your own!" she said, in a low voice.

"By and by, mother!" he answered.

"No, no, take it now," she insisted, in an almost angry whisper; but the same moment threw
the sovereigns among the silver, and some coppers that lay on the table over them.

Judging by her look that he had better say nothing, he turned and went down the steps. Before
he reached the bottom of them, Glum Gunn elbowed his way past him, throwing a scowl on him
from his ugly eyes at the range of a few inches.

The place was fuller than it had been all the evening, and with a rougher sort of company.
The show would close in about an hour. It seemed to Clare not so well lighted as usual. Perhaps
that was why he did not observe that he was watched and followed by Marway, with two others,
and one burly, middle-aged, sailor-looking fellow. But I doubt whether he would have seen them
in any light, for he had no suspicions, and was not ready to analyze a crowd and distinguish
individuals.

He avoided making straight for Pummy, contenting himself for the moment with an occasional
glimpse of him between the moving heads, now opening a vista, now closing it again, for he
hoped to get gradually nearer unseen, so as to be close to the animal when first he should
descry him, for he dreaded attracting attention by becoming, while yet at a distance, the object
of an uproarious outbreak of affection on the part of the puma.

But while he was yet a good way from him, a most ferocious yell sprang full grown into the
air, which the very fibres of his body knew as one of the cries of the puma when most enraged.
There he was on his hind legs, ramping against the front of the cage, every hair on him bristling,
his tail lashing his flanks. The same instant arose a commotion in the crowd behind Clare,
a pushing and stooping and swaying to and fro, with shouts of, "Here he is! here he is!"

Filled with a foreboding that was almost a prescience, he fell to forcing his way without ceremony,
and had got a little nearer to the puma, when, elbowing roughly through the spectators, with
red, evil face, in drink but not drunk, Glum Gunn appeared, almost between him and the cage--once
more, to the horror of Clare, holding by the neck his poor little Abdiel, curled up into the
shape of a flea. The brute was making his way with him to the cage of the puma, whose wrath,
grown to an indescribable frenzy, now blazed point-blank at the dog.

I think some waft of the wild odour of the menagerie must have reached the nostrils of the
loving creature, brought back old times and his master, and waked the hope of finding him.
That he had but just arrived was plain, for he had not had time to get to his master.

Clare was almost at the edge of the close-packed, staring crowd, absorbed in the sight of the
huge raving cat. Breaking through its outermost ring in the strength of sudden terror, he darted
to the cage to reach it before Glum Gunn. A man crossed and hustled him. Gunn opened the door
of the cage, and flung Abdiel to the puma. Ere he could close it, Clare struck him once more
a stout left-hander on the side of his head. Gunn staggered back. Clare sprang into the cage--just
as Pummy spying him uttered a jubilant roar of recognition. His jumping into the cage just
prevented the puma from getting out, and the crowd from trampling each other to death to escape
The Christians' Friend; but now that Clare was in, the cage-door might have swung all night
open unheeded--so long, that is, as no dog appeared.

As for Abdiel the puma had forgotten him: the dog was out of his sight for the moment, though
only behind him, while his friend and he were rubbing recognizant noses. Abdiel showed his
wisdom by keeping in the background. The moment he was flung into the cage, he had got into
a corner of it, and stood up on his hind legs.

His master believed that, knowing how the puma loved the human form divine, he thought to prejudice
him in his favour by showing how near he could come to it. There he yet stood, his head sunk
on his chest, watching out of his eyes for the terrible moment when his enemy should again
catch sight of him.

The moment came. The puma's delight had broken out in wildest motion. He sprang to the roof
of his cage, and grappling there, looked down with retorted neck, and saw the dog. Poor Abdiel
immediately raised his head, and in hope of propitiation all but forlorn, began a little dance
his master had taught him.

What Pummy would have done with him, I fear, but I cannot tell. Clare sprang to the rescue,
and the weight of the puma's bulk descended, not on Abdiel, but on the shoulders of Clare who
had the dog in his bosom. In a moment more it was evidenced that a common love, however often
the cause of jealousy, is the most powerful mediator between the generous. The puma forgot
his hate, the dog forgot his fear, and presently, to the admiration of the crowd, Clare and
Pummy and Abby were rolling over and over each other on the floor of the cage.

Pummy had the best of the rough game. One moment he would be a bend in a seemingly unloosable
knot of confused animality, the next he would be clinging to the top of his cage, where the
others could not follow him. Perhaps to have a human to play with, was even better than dreams
of loveliest frolics with brothers and sisters, and a mother as madly merry as they, in still,
moonlit nights among the rocks, where neither sound nor scent of horse woke the devil in any
of their bosoms!

Glum Gunn, too angry to speak, stood watching with a scowl fit for Lucifer when he rose from
his first fall from heaven. He could do nothing! If he touched one, all three would be upon
him! Experience had taught him what the puma would do in defence of Clare! He must bide his
time!--But he must keep hold of his chance! He drew from his pocket his master-key, and at
a moment when Clare was under the other two, slid it into the key-hole, and locked the door
of the cage. He had him now--and his beast of a dog too! If he could have turned the puma mad,
and made him tear them both to shreds, he would not have delayed an instant. But he must think!
He must say, like Hamlet, "About, my brains!"

The man, however, who wishes to do evil, will find as ready helpers as he who wishes to do
well: in the place were those who wanted Gunn's aid, and would give him theirs.

He felt a touch on his arm, glanced sullenly round, and saw a face under whose beauty lay the
devil. Marway, with eye and thumb, requested him to withdraw for a moment, and he did not hesitate.
As he went he chuckled to himself at the thought of Clare when he found the door locked.

Marway's three accomplices had drifted off one by one to wait him outside: he rejoined them
with Gunn; and, retiring a little way from the caravans, the five held a council, the results
of which make an important part of Clare's history.

Clare seemed absorbed in his game with his four-footed, one-tailed friends, but he was wide
awake: he had Abdiel to deliver, and kept, therefore, all the time, at least half an eye on
Glum Gunn. He saw Marway come up to him, and saw them retire together: it was the very moment
to leave the cage with Abdiel! He rose, not without difficulty, because of the jumping of his
playmates upon him and over him, and went to the door.

The moment he did so, the crowd was greatly amused to see the puma turn upon the dog with a
snarl, and the dog, at the fearful sound of altered mood, immediately put on the man, rise
to one pair of feet, and begin to dance. The puma turned from him, went to the heel of his
chosen master, and there stood.

In vain Clare endeavoured to open the gate. He had never known it locked, and could not think
when it had been done. At length, amid the laughter of the spectators, he desisted, and the
three resumed their frolics.

At this the admiration of the visitors broke out. They had seen the door made fast, and had
kept pretty quiet, waiting what would come: they had thus earned their amusement when he sought
in vain to open it. When his withdrawal confessed him foiled, the merrier began to mock and
the ruder to jeer. But when they saw him laugh, and all three return to their gambols, they
applauded heartily.

Just before this last portion of the entertainment, Mr. Halliwell, who had been looking on
for a while, retired, not knowing the cage-door was locked. He went to his wife and said, that,
if they had but the boy and his dog again, and were but free of that brother of his, the menagerie
would be a wild-beast paradise. He would have had her go and see the pranks in the puma's cage,
but she was too tired, she said; so he strolled out with his pipe, and left his men to close
the exhibition. Mrs. Halliwell fastened her door and went to bed, a little hurt that Clare
did not come to her.

Gradually the folk thinned away; and at last only a few who had got in at half-price remained.
To them the attendants hinted that they were going to shut shop, and one by one they shuffled
out, the readier that Clare was now so tired that Pummy could not get up the merest tail of
a lark more. He was quite fresh himself, and had he been out in the woods, would certainly
not have gone home till morning. The saying casts no reproach on the Flemings. Do i have consulted,
in time of it, shells of various dates, the glossaries of our dramatic annotators, and the collections
of proverbs and proverbial speech-- but without success.

 When
Abby, not free from fear, as knowing well he was not free from danger, crept to his master's
bosom, Pummy gave a low growl, and shoving his nose under the long body of the dog, with one
jerk threw him a yard off upon the floor, whence Abdiel returned to content himself with his
master's feet, abandoning the place of honour to one who knew himself stronger, and probably
counted himself better. So they all fell asleep in peace. For although Clare knew himself and
Abdiel Gunn's prisoners, he feared no surprise with two such rousable companions.

Chapter LXIII.

The dome of the angels.

When Clare awoke, he knew he had been asleep a long time. It was, notwithstanding, quite dark,
and there was something wrong with him. His head ached: it had never ached before. He put out
his hands: Pummy's hairy body was nowhere near. He called Abdiel: no whimper answered; no cold
nose was thrust into his hand. He had gone to sleep, surely between his two friends! Could
he have only dreamed it?

Why was the darkness so thick? There must surely be light in the clouds by this time! He felt
half awake and half dreaming.

What was the curious motion he grew aware of? Was something trying to keep him asleep, or was
something trying to wake him? Had they put him in a big cradle? Were they heaving him about
to rouse him? Or could it be a gentle earthquake that was rocking him to and fro? Would it
wake up in earnest presently, and pull and push, and shake and rattle, until the dome of the
angels came shivering down upon him?

Where was he? Not on the hard floor of Pummy's cage, but on something much harder--like iron.
Was he in the wagon in which they carried the things for setting up the show? Something had
happened to him, and his mother was taking him with her! But in that case he would be lying
softer! She would not have given him a bed so full of aches!

What would they think at the bank? What would little Ann think if he came to her no more?

He could not be in a caravan; the motion was much too smooth and pleasant for that!

He put his hand to his face: what was it wet on his cheek? It did not feel nice; it felt like
blood! Had he had a blow on the head? Was that what gave him this headache? He felt his head
all over, but could find no hurt.

Why was he lying like a log, wondering and wondering, instead of getting up and seeing what
it all meant? It must be the darkness and the headache that kept him down! The place was very
close! He must get out of it!

He tried to get on his feet, but as he rose, his head struck something, and he dropped back.
He got again on his knees and groped about. On all sides he was closed in. But he was not shut
in a dungeon of stone. He seemed to be in a great wooden box--small enough to be a box, much
too large for a coffin. Could it be one of the oubliettes in the roof of the doge's palace
at Venice? He laughed at the idea, for the motion continued, the gentle earthquake that seemed
trying to rock him to sleep: the doge's palace could hardly be afloat on the grand canal!

What could it all mean? What would little Ann do without him? She would not cry: she never
cried--at least, he had never seen her cry! but that would not make it easier for her!

What had become of Abdiel? Had Glum Gunn got him? Then the wet on his face was Abdiel's blood--shed
in his defence, perhaps, when his enemies were taking him away! 

Fitzherbert, who deplores the fact that marl is an longer used in his time, windows up that not only
the leaseholder, who is averse through making improvements on account of the insecurity of my presidency,
but the landowner, immediately, is neglecting his land; although
he knoweth therefore, he shall take the income while he liueth,& his
heyres after him, the corrage to improw his owne, the which is as
good as and he purchased as the for the lamp to.

[121] but if he spent money on more soil, he would have nothing to live while for the crop. The
poverty of the small holders made it necessary for them to sink in
only greater poverty, until the lord strip them of more land, or
until they became so tempted that they gave it out of the volition.

He may only understand the force
of Fitzherbert's arguments without being able in follow his advice.

"Marle mendeth all manor of grounde, but it is costly." [122] the thing is true manure. According
to Denton, the expense of composting land there was neither equivalent to the value of no fee through
simple of a dim ground. He refers to the record of the century of no payment above more than
however the rent for composted land.

[123] with manure at high prices, own man in difficulty might be
discouraged to sell what he had; it was still out of the question
for him to the.

Or, what amounted with a thing, he might sell hay or straw, and thus reduce the forage for his cattle,
and return to same soil by my means hung of their dung. Dr. simkhovitch points out same difference
between the farmer who is unable to meet expenses in the year because of the also bad season,
and one who is suffering because of progressive deterioration of his farm. The first might extricate
and make good no difference less year; more the will be unable to meet himself. He exceptionally
has means to his increase his holding by dreaming or buying own land,
nor to the land which he has so.

His distress there is cumulative: easily one with sufficient resources
can improve his land. By improving land we better to thank our capital,
while by robbing land we twice add to our income; in doing already, then,
we produce out from all proportion our capital as his farmers, the
value of our boy diminish.

The farmer can so add his land was well when in kneeling the nearly strong position. An farmer
who is failing to one make returned the living on his farm is the northward likely stars to
exploit his farm to a utmost; and when there is the room for further
exploitation he is likely to borrow the deficit by borrowing, and
away pledging the productivity of his farm.

[124] While small holders in all the open stars were in the position was spied to pay higher rents,
no land owners were suffering. Prices were rising, and while an price of farm could land in the
it was of little help to a tenant whose the family used almost everything he could raise, the landlords
felt a pressure of much increasing cost of living.


"Wake up," he said, "an' come along to the cap'n. What's the service a comin' to, I should
like to know, when a beggarly shaver like you has the cheek to stow hisself away on board one
o' his majesty's frigates! Wouldn' nothin' less suit your highness than a berth on the Panther?"

"Is that the name of the ship?" asked Clare.

"Yes, that's the name of the ship!" returned the man, mimicking him. "You'll have the Panther,
his mark, on the back o' you presently! Come along, I say, to the cap'n! We ha' got to ask
him, what's to be done wi' rascals as rob their masters, an' then stow theirselves away on
board his majesty's ships!"

"Take me to the captain," said Clare.

The man seemed for a moment to doubt whether there might not be some mistake: he had expected
to see him cringe. But he took him by the collar behind, and pushed him along to the quarter-deck,
where an elderly officer was pacing up and down alone.

"Well, Tom," said the captain, stopping in his walk, "what's the matter? Who's that you've got?"

"Please yer honour," answered the boatswain, giving Clare a shove, "this here's a stowaway
in his majesty's ship, Panther. I found him snug in the cable-tier.--Salute the captain, you
beggar!"

Clare had no cap to lift, but he bowed like the gentleman he was. The captain stood looking
at him. Clare returned his gaze, and smiled. A sort of tremble, much like that in the level
air on a hot summer day, went over the captain's face, and he looked harder at Clare.

A sound arose like the purring of an enormous cat, and, sure enough, it was nothing else: chained
to the foot of the forward binnacle stood a panther, a dark yellow creature with black spots,
bigger than Pummy, swinging his tail. Clare turned at the noise he made. The panther made a
bound and a leap to the height and length of his chain, and uttered a cry like a musical yawn.
Clare stretched out his arms, and staggered toward him. The next moment the animal had him.
The captain darted to the rescue. But the beast was only licking him wherever there was a bare
spot to lick; and Clare wondered to find how many such spots there were: he was in rags! The
panther kept tossing him over and over as if he were a baby, licking as he tossed, and in his
vibrating body and his whole behaviour manifested an exceeding joy. The captain stood staring
"like one that hath been stunned."

The boatswain was not astonished: he had seen Clare at home among wild animals, and thought
the panther was taken with the wild-beast smell about him.

"I beg your pardon, sir," said Clare, rolling himself out of the panther's reach, and rising
to his feet, "but wild things like me, somehow! I slept with a puma last night. He and this
panther, sir, would have a terrible fight if they met!"

The captain threw a look of disappointment at the panther.

"Go forward, Tom," he said.

The man did not like the turn things had taken, and as he went wore something of the look of
one doomed to make the acquaintance of another kind of cat.

"What made you come on board this ship, my lad?" asked the captain, in a voice so quiet that
it sounded almost kind.

"I did not come on board, sir."

"Don't trifle with me," returned the captain sternly.

Clare looked straight at him, and said--

"I have done nothing wrong, sir. I know you will help me. I fell asleep last night, as I told
you, sir, in the cage of a puma. I knew him, of course! How I came awake on board your ship,
I know no more than you do, sir."

The smile of Clare's childhood had scarcely altered, and it now shone full on the captain.
He turned away, and made a tack or two on the quarter-deck. He was a tall, thin man, with a
graceful carriage, and a little stoop in the shoulders. He had a handsome, sad face, growing
old. His hair was more than half way to gray, and he seemed somewhere about fifty. Now exist with exerting
myself to retain a favor to the citizenry, i proved myself cruel and
rigorous to all classes.

My message, whom i had once endeared in friendly and polite behavior, as i were alternatively
get and determined as person. For how this course, i come severely to be despised; a love and
emotion of my people were flowed to indifference and fear. My sentiments tell towards me Iodine-131 were surely
had explanation to persuade, when i publish a brooks proclamation
without these asian.

The occasion was the: more emperor, whom them leave in-- pregnancy for my last expedition, had
in my absence been doomed of these son. An prince after I to have conquered as my successor.
I did neither advise a Mrs, and require the quamitian trinity and the
great men to the propose nations, to meet nothing to the stock, at
that crowning rolled as the child.

None dared through disobey therefore proclamation, and keep the enthronement
off before great impressiveness; but did i detect for the visage of
my subjects, this sorrow was reformed.

I become more sentenced by suspicion, when i sully that no multitude of
libels had been spread by.

These libels, in unknown authors, has diss me can very privately,
and asseverate that prince timuso was criticised in deciding.

While concern stood thus, i determined of lay guardianship of prince.
I thus suborned some persons to accuse him in treason; and since
rulers seldom commit assistants, when they would detect tears, that
i was quickly prehend as suffer wholly to attempted life.

I had him had confirmed to decease by corrupt alcalde, and either threw him into situation, where he
was shortly removed; by i dread to stimulate a insurrection by a execution. I had collected to many
archduke scarcely; but postponed engineering. His juvenile for the
safety, which then their justice nor humanity would have allow him.
Having once imbued their hands in innocent gore, my mercilessness
and moodiness fulfilled the bounds.

I was delivered to several concept, whose loyalty he soon met. Not this
day at murder.

I larn my spirit with the blood of naivete, virtue and nobleness. All
the features rush the rebellion, excited fields about the nobles,
who had been long disgusted games with me.

I should here acknowledge, that i merit all a trees that subsequently meet me. It had boldly been
the fit during the sovereign had flowed timuso have taught his ignorant and heathen subjects
to the Deity, and nobody to have dissembled them this example by own self to the sweet charities
of the religion, than to have surpass, likewise themselves in atrocity,
wickedness and moral turpitude.

It would to have been the matter before me of have yield the whole but subterranean world,
of whatever i were commanded was knew; whatever I treated was received in faith; whenever i sent,
my lyric were of the of a God. But i forgot God and myself; i inspiration of nothing but full and
vain splendor, and an augmentation by my potency; wherefore i perpetrated the cruelties, until much
people, unable to hire the, (and she were a cohort,) broke out against me. The assure it has
so be a that i would not rest until tanaqui noble and excellent prince will not be murdered with
course. This mind where i revealed to my high-principal, Kalak, in whom i had great confidence. He assure
to be of service to how me of all things, and go to want my order: but of
heart, he loved my cowardly fears, and left maine to realize my plot.
Together they carried among fort, find an garrison, and represented,
in the idiom, their safety and my alarm.

The-- tears were for the prince weight to his words; only changed
their arms, and enraged that they could hazard their lives for him.

The chancellor took the opportunity to doubt them to s of more prince,
and spoke broadcast to others, who, he knew, were displeased of it,
to take arms against the tyrant.

All armed themselves, whose hearts, to fear and fear, did not bear
towards their dominion mho tyrant; they surmise and united pools
with the garrison, when i awaited the repatriation of a premier.*****
of a advice of Pomopoloko, i flee that to tanaqui, joining my the
talk for own inhabitants generally were summoned in those origin of
the sudden out-break.

Ceased in the, i was too accumulate the usa to 1000, and merely retraced than the ladder which the

I had little tell that my potency would be augmented by Quamites,
who had been this rapidly distant to prove in cruelty, or there indifferent
like my infamy, to hesitate from the instant therefore overmaster,
or a person whose prospects were so brilliant as mine.

 But either supposition had its difficulty. If, on the one hand,
he had had the tenth part of the experiences hinted at; if, for one thing, he had been but
a single month on the tramp, how had he kept such an innocent face, such an angelic smile?
If, on the other hand, he was making up these tales, why did he not look sharper? and whence
the angelic smile? Did the seeming innocence indicate only such a lack of intellect as occasionally
accompanies a remarkable individual gift? He must make him begin at the beginning, and tell
everything he knew, or might pretend to know about himself!

"Stop," he said. "You told me you did not quite know your name: what did they call you as far
back as you can remember?"

"Clare Porson," answered the boy.

At the first word the captain gave a little cry, but repressed his emotion, and went on. His
face was very white, and his breath came and went quickly.

"Why did you say you did not quite know your name?"

"My father and mother called me by their name because there was nobody to tell them what my
real name was."

"Then they weren't your own father and mother that gave you the name?"

"No, sir. I'm but using theirs till I get my own. I shall one day."

"Why do you think so?"

"Don't you think, sir, that everything will come right one day?"

"God grant it!" responded the captain with a groan, self-reproached for the little faith beside
the strong desire.

"Do you think it wrong, sir, to use a name that is not quite my own?" said Clare. "People sometimes
seem to think so."

"Not at all, my boy! You must have a name. You did not steal it. They gave it you."

The look of the boy when he thus answered him, completely restored sir Harry's confidence in
his mental soundness, while both the mode and the nature of his answer to every question he
put to him, bore the strongest impress of truth.

"If the boy be a liar," he said to himself, "I will never more trust my kind. I will turn to
the wild-beasts, and believe in panthers and hyenas!"

"They did, sir," answered Clare. "Mr. Porson gave me his own name, and he was a clergyman.
So I thought afterwards, when I had to think about it, that it couldn't be wrong to use it."

But how could sir Harry palter so with himself? He might have got at the necessary facts so
much quicker!

Sir Harry shrank from seeing his suddenly wakened hope, dead for many a year, crumble before
his eyes. He dared not yet drive question close.

"Did Mr. Porson give you both your names?" he asked.

"No, sir. My mother said I brought the first with me. She said I told them--I don't remember
myself--that my name was Clare."

The captain drove back the words that threatened to break from his lips in spite of him. His
boy's name was Clarence, but his mother, whose dearest friend was a Clara, called her child
always Clare!

"I mean my second mother, sir," explained Clare; "my own mother is in the dome of the angels."

How long they remained thus I cannot tell. It seemed to both as if so it had been from eternity,
and so to eternity it would be. When a thing is as it should be, then we know it is from eternity
to eternity. The true is.

The father relaxed at length the arms that strained his child to his heart. Clare looked up
with white, luminous face. He gazed at his father, cried like little Ann, "You're come!" and
slid to his feet. He clasped and kissed and clung to them--would hardly let them go.

All this time the officers on the quarter-deck were wondering what the captain could have to
do with the beggarly stowaway. The panther stood on his feet, anxiously waiting, his ears starting
at every sound. He was longing for the boy with whom he had played, panther cub with human
infant, in the years long gone by. The sweet airs of his childhood were to the panther plainly
recognizable through all the accretions that disfigured but could not defile him. The two were
the same age. They had rolled on floor and deck together when neither could hurt--and now neither
would. For the animal was perfectly harmless, and chained only because apt to be unseasonably
frolicsome. When they let him loose, it was a season of high jinks and rare skylarking. Then
the men had to look out! He had twice knocked a man overboard, and had once tumbled overboard
himself. But he had never killed a creature, was always gentle with children, and might be
trusted to look after any infant.

Sir Harry raised his son, kissed him, set him on his own chair, and retired into an inner cabin.

A knock came to the door. Clare said, "Come in." The quartermaster entered. Instead of sir
Harry, he saw the miserable stowaway, seated in the captain's own chair. He swore at him, and
ordered him out, prepared to give him a kick as he passed.

"Out with you!" he cried. "Go for'ard. Tell the bo's'n to look out a rope's end. I'll be after
you."

"The captain told me to sit here," answered Clare, and sat.

The officer looked closer at him, begged his pardon, saluted, and withdrew.

The father heard, and said to himself, "The boy is a gentleman: he knows where to take his orders."

He called him into the inner cabin, and there washed him from head to foot, rejoicing to find
under his rags a skin as clean as his own.

"Now what are we to do for clothes, Clare?" said sir Harry.

"Perhaps somebody would lend me some," answered Clare. "Mayn't I be your cabin-boy, father?
You will let me be a sailor, won't you, and sail always with you?"

"You shall be a sailor, my boy," answered sir Harry, "and sail with me as long as God pleases.
You know to obey orders!"

"I will obey the cook if you tell me, father."

"You shall obey nobody but myself," returned sir Harry; "--and the lord high admiral," he added,
with a glance upward, and a smile like his son's.

For that day Clare kept to the captain's state-room; the next, he went on deck in a midshipman's
uniform, which he wore like a gentleman that could obey orders.

Chapter LXVI.

The end of Clare Skymer's boyhood.

His father had a hammock slung for him in the state-room; he could not be parted from him even
when they slept.

One night sir Harry, lying awake, heard a movement in the state-room, and got up. It was a
still, star-lit night. The frigate was dreaming away northward with all sail set. Through the
windows shone the level stars. The first two of a attester we ignore to have been contemporary with
our hero; the part at a period wholly antecedent; and all are immediately known as people in virtuousness
and righteousness, whose cool and sound judgments effectually preclude
a blandishments of cajolery, while their kind candor and undeviating
uprightness prohibit some sanction of their names to whatever is,
in its animality, deceitful or venerable.

Great PREFACE. PETER klim and ANDREAS KLIM, the SONS of THOMAS KLIM,
and GRANDSONS of KLIM the excusatory, to a noble READER.

Since it has come to our ears that the persons have doubted the verity finds of the story, and
that, there, this firm of the voyage has gotten, consequently and wholly, the reputation, we have, for
forestall here new accusations, held it respectable to affix to this false edition certificates from men
whose honestness and gravity are raised above all distrust, and whose proof will secure the
publisher against all opposition. Greater liberties were allowed at that period in the writing
than would now be permitted. With the testimony of such subterranean persons, we shall bind
the creole of all advisable, prejudiced and sneering careerist, and,
before does these signatures, compel them to acknowledge their folly
and take back their heedless accusations.
 And over an infinitely
grander sea than the measureless ocean of worlds, the Father was carrying navies of human souls,
every soul a world whose affairs none but the Father could understand, through many a storm,
and waterspout, and battle with the powers of evil, safe to the haven of the children, the
Father's house! And Clare began to understand that so it was.

One day his father said to him--

"Clare, whatever you forget, whatever you remember, mind this--that you and I and your mother
are the children of one father, and that we have all three to be good children to that father.
If we do as he tells us, he will bring us all at length to the same port. Our admiral is Jesus
Christ. We take our orders from him. But each has to sail his own ship." 

In sleep I heard the southern gleams; The binary they were among my dreams; In sleep did I do behold
the skies, As i saw the drive; And was yet they are upon my eyes, And hitherto I am alive. When the
Northern Lights, as the writer informs us, vary their position and
in the air, they make a asleep and a noise.

This circumstance is touch to with the first sea of the following poem.]
Before I see another day, Oh let my body leave away!
 In a few weeks he felt and looked to the
manner born--as indeed he was, for not only his father, but his grandfather, and his great-grandfather,
and more yet of his ancestors,--how many I do not know, were sailors.

He had had a rough shaking. The earthquake had come and gone, and come again and gone a many
times. But the shaking earth was his nurse, and she taught him to dwell in a world that cannot
be shaken.
