He looked and saw she was indeed made new, restored to the lustre and fulness of her young
womanhood. He remembered then that she had long been silent when he came near her, plainly
conscious of his presence but with an apparent constraint, with something almost tentative
in her manner. With her return to health and comeliness there had come back to her a thousand
little graces of dress and manner and speech. She drew him, with his starved love of beauty
and his need of companionship; drew him with a mighty power, and he knew it at last. He remembered
how he had felt and faintly thrilled under a certain soft suppression in her tones when she
had spoken to him of late; this had drawn him, and the new light in her eyes and her whole
freshened womanhood, even before he knew it. Now that he did know it he felt himself shaken
and all but lost; clutching weakly at some support that threatened every moment to give way.

And she was his wife, his who had starved year after year for the light touch of a woman's
hand and the tones of her voice that should be for him alone. He knew now that he had ached
and sickened in his yearning for this, and she stood there for him in the soft night. He knew
she was waiting, and he knew he desired above all things else to go to her; that the comfort
of her, his to take, would give him new life, new desires, new powers; that with her he would
revive as she had done. He waited long, indulging freely in hesitation, bathing his wearied
soul in her nearness--yielding in fancy.

Then he walked off into the night, down through the village, past the light of open doors,
and through the voices that sounded from them, out on to the bare bench of the mountain--his
old refuge in temptation--where he could be safe from submitting to what his soul had forbidden.
He had meant to take up a cross, but before his very eyes it had changed to be a snare set
for him by the Devil.

He stayed late on the ground in the darkness, winning the battle for himself over and over,
decisively, he thought, at the last. But when he went home she was there in the doorway to
meet him, still silent, but with eyes that told more than he dared to hear. He thought she
had in some way divined his struggle, and was waiting to strengthen the odds against him, with
her face in the light of a candle she held above her head.

He went by her without speaking, afraid of his weakness, and rushed to his little cell-like
room to fight the battle over. As a last source of strength he took from its hiding-place the
little Bible. And as it fell open naturally at the blood-washed page a new thing came, a new
torture. No sooner had his eyes fallen on the stain than it seemed to him to cry out of itself,
so that he started back from it. He shut the book and the cries were stilled; he opened it
and again he heard them--far, loud cries and low groans close to his ear; then long piercing
screams stifled suddenly too low, horrible gurglings. And before him came the inscrutable face
with the deep gray eyes and the shining lips, lifting, with love in the eyes, above a gashed
throat.

He closed the book and fell weakly to his knees to pray brokenly, and almost despairingly:
"Help me to keep down this self within me; let it ask for nothing; fan the fires until they
consume it! Bow me, bend me, break me, burn me out--burn me out!"

In the morning, when he said, "Martha, the harvest is over now, and I want you to go north
with me," she prepared to obey without question.

He talked freely to her on the way, though it is probable that he left in her mind little more
than dark confusion, beyond the one clear fact of his wish. As to this, she knew she must have
no desire but to comply. Reaching Salt Lake City, they went at once to Brigham's office. When
they came out they came possessed of a document in duplicate, reciting that they both did "covenant,
promise, and agree to dissolve all the relations which have hitherto existed between us as
husband and wife, and to keep ourselves separate and apart from each other from this time forth."

This was the simple divorce which Brigham was good enough to grant to such of the Saints as
found themselves unhappily married, and wished it. As Joel Rae handed the Prophet the fee of
ten dollars, which it was his custom to charge for the service, Brigham made some timely remarks.
He said he feared that Martha had been perverse and rebellious; that her first husband had
found her so; and that it was doubtless for the good of all that her second had taken the resolution
to divorce her. He was afraid that Brother Joel was an inferior judge of women; but he had
surely shown himself to be generous in the provision he was making for the support of this
contumacious wife.

They parted outside the door of the little office, and he kissed her for the first time since
they had been married--on the forehead.

CHAPTER XXVII.

A New Cross Taken up and an Old Enemy Forgiven

Christina would now be left alone with the cares of the house, and he knew he ought to have
some one to help her. The fever of sacrifice was also upon him. And so he found another derelict,
to whom he was sealed forever.

At a time of more calmness he might have balked at this one. She was a cross, to be sure, and
it was now his part in life to bear crosses. But there were plenty of these, and even one vowed
to a life of sacrifice, he suspected, need not grossly abuse the powers of discrimination with
which Heaven had seen fit to endow him. But he had lately been on the verge of a seething maelstrom,
balancing there with unholy desire and wickedly looking far down, and the need to atone for
this sin excited him to indiscretions.

It was not that this star in his crown was in her late thirties and less than lovely. He had
learned, indeed, that in the game which, for the chastening of his soul, he now played with
the Devil, it were best to choose stars whose charms could excite to little but conduct of
a saintlike seemliness. The fat, dumpy figure of this woman, therefore, and her round, flat,
moonlike face, her mouse-coloured wisps of hair cut squarely off at the back of her neck, were
points of a merit that was in its whole effect nothing less than distinguished.

But she talked. Her tones played with the constancy of an ever-living fountain. Artlessly she
lost herself in the sound of their music, until she also lost her sense of proportion, of light
and shade, of simple, Christian charity. Her name was Lorena Sears, and she had come in with
one of the late trains of converts, without friends, relatives, or means, with nothing but
her natural gifts and an abiding faith in the saving powers of the new dispensation. And though
she was so alive in her faith, rarely informed in the Scriptures, bubbling with enthusiasm
for the new covenant, the new Zion, and the second coming of the Messiah, there had seemed
to be no place for her. She had not been asked in marriage, nor had she found it easy to secure
work to support herself.

"She's strong," said Brigham, to his inquiring Elder, "and a good worker, but even Brother
Heber Kimball wouldn't marry her; and between you and me, Brother Joel, I never knew Heber
to shy before at anything that would work. You can see that, yourself, by looking over his
household."

But, after the needful preliminaries, and a very little coy hesitation on the part of the lady,
Lorena Sears, spinster, native of Elyria, Ohio, was duly sealed to, for time and eternity,
and became a star forever in the crown of, Joel Rae, Elder after the Order of Melchisedek in
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and President of the Amalon Stake of Zion.

In the bustle of the start south there were, of necessity, moments in which the crown's new
star could not talk; but these blessed respites were at an end when at last they came to the
open road.

At first, as her speech flowed on, he looked sidelong at her, in a trouble of fear and wonder;
then, at length, absently, trying to put his mind elsewhere and to leave her voice as the muted
murmur of a distant torrent. He succeeded fairly well in this, for Lorena combined admirably
in herself the parts of speaker and listener, and was not, he thankfully noted, watchful of
his attention.

But in spite of all he could do, sentences would come to seize upon his ears: "... No chance
at all back there for a good girl with any heart in her unless she's one of the doll-baby kind,
and, thank fortune, I never was that! Now there was Wilbur Watkins--his father was president
of the board of chosen freeholders--Wilbur had a way of saying, 'Lorena's all right--she weighs
a hundred and seventy-eight pounds on the big scales down to the city meatmarket, and it's
most of it heart--a hundred and seventy-eight pounds and most all heart--and she'd be a prize
to anybody,' but then, that was his way,--Wilbur was a good deal of a take-on,--and there was
never anything between him and me. And when the Elder come along and begun to preach about
the new Zion and tell about the strange ways that the Lord had ordered people to act out here,
something kind of went all through me, and I says, 'That's the place for me!' Of course, the
saying is, 'There ain't any Gawd west of the Missouri,' but them that says it ain't of the
house of Israel--lots of folks purtends to be great Bible readers, but pin 'em right down and
what do you find?--you find they ain't really studied it--not what you could call pored over
it. They fuss through a chapter here and there, and rush lickety-brindle through another, and
ain't got the blessed truth out of any of 'em--little fine points, like where the Lord hardened
Pharaoh's heart every time, for why?--because if He hadn't 'a' done it Pharaoh would 'a' give
in the very first time and spoiled the whole thing. Oh, I've spent hours and hours over the
blessed Book. I bet I know something you don't, now--what verse in the Bible has every letter
in the alphabet in it except 'J'? Of course you wouldn't know. Plenty of preachers don't. It's
the twenty-first verse of the seventh chapter of the book of Ezra. And the Book of Mormon--I
do love to git set down in a rocker with my shoes off--I'm kind of a heavy-footed person to
be on my feet all day--and that blessed Book in my hands--such beautiful language it uses--that
verse I love so, 'He went forth among the people waving the rent of his garment in the air
that all might see the writing which he had wrote upon the rent,'--that's sure enough Bible
language, ain't it? And yet some folks say the Book of Mormon ain't inspired.

He was called back by the stopping of her voice, but she had to repeat her question before
he understood it. The Devil tempted him in that moment. He was on the point of answering, "Because
she talked too much," but instead he climbed out of the wagon to walk. He walked most of the
three hundred miles in the next ten days. Nights and mornings he falsely pretended to be deaf.

He found himself in this long walk full of a pained discouragement; not questioning or doubting,
for he had been too well trained ever to do either. But he was disturbed by a feeling of bafflement,
as might be a ground-mole whose burrow was continually destroyed by an enemy it could not see.
This feeling had begun in Salt Lake City, for there he had seen that the house of Israel was
no longer unspotted of the world. Since the army with its camp-followers had come there was
drunkenness and vice, the streets resounded with strange oaths, and the midnight murder was
common. Even Brigham seemed to have become a gainsayer in behalf of Mammon, and the people,
quick to follow his lead, were indulging in ungodly trade with Gentiles; even with the army
that had come to invade them. And more and more the Gentiles were coming in. He heard strange
tales of the new facilities afforded them. There was actually a system of wagon-trains regularly
hauling freight from the Missouri to the Pacific; there was a stage-route bringing passengers
and mail from Babylon; even Horace Greeley had been publicly entertained in Zion,--accorded
honour in the Lord's stronghold. There was talk, too, of a pony-express, to bring them mail
from the Missouri in six days; and a few visionaries were prophesying that a railroad would
one day come by them. The desert was being peopled all about them, and neighbours were forcing
a way up to their mountain retreat.

It seemed they were never to weld into one vast chain the broken links of the fated house of
Abraham; never to be free from Gentile contamination. He groaned in spirit as he went--walking
well ahead of his wagon.

But he had taken up a new cross and he had his reward. The first night after they reached home
he took the little Bible from its hiding-place and opened it with trembling hands. The stain
was there, red in the candle-light. But the cries no longer rang in his ears as on that other
night when he had been sinful before the page. And he was glad, knowing that the self within
him had again been put down.

Then came strange news from the East--news of a great civil war. The troops of the enemy at
Camp Floyd hurried east to battle, and even the name of that camp was changed, for the Gentile
Secretary of War, said gossip from Salt Lake City, after doing his utmost to cripple his country
by sending to far-off Utah the flower of its army, had now himself become not only a rebel
but a traitor.

Even Johnston, who had commanded the invading army, denouncing the Saints as rebels, had put
off his blue uniform for a gray and was himself a rebel.

When the news came that South Carolina had actually flung the palmetto flag to the breeze and
fired the first gun, he was inclined to exult. For plainly it was the Lord's work. There was
His revelation given to Joseph Smith almost thirty years before: "Verily, thus saith the Lord
concerning the wars that will come to pass, beginning at the rebellion of South Carolina."
And ten years later the Lord had revealed to Joseph further concerning this prophecy that this
war would be "previous to the coming of the Son of Man." Assuredly, they were now near the
time when other Prophets of the Church had said He would come--the year 1870. He thrilled to
be so near the actual moving of the hand of God, and something of the old spirit revived within
him.

From Salt Lake City came news of the early fighting and of meetings for public rejoicing held
in the tabernacle, with prophecies that the Gentile nation would now be rent asunder in punishment
for its rejection of the divine message of the Book of Mormon and its persecution of the prophets
of God. In one of these meetings of public thanksgiving Brigham had said from the tabernacle
pulpit: "What is the strength of this man Lincoln? It is like a rope of sand. He is as weak
as water,--an ignorant, Godless shyster from the backwoods of Illinois. I feel disgraced in
having been born under a government that has so little power for truth and right. And now it
will be broken in pieces like a potter's vessel."

These public rejoicings, however, brought a further trial upon the Saints. The Third California
Infantry and a part of the Second Cavalry were now ordered to Utah. The commander of this force
was one Connor, an officer of whom extraordinary reports were brought south. Even liberty of
opinion, it appeared, was thus to be strangled in these last days before the Lord came.

Further, this ill-tempered Gentile, instead of keeping decently remote from Salt Lake City,
as General Johnston had done, had marched his troops into the very stronghold of Zion, despite
all threats of armed opposition, and in the face of a specific offer from one Prophet, Seer,
and Revelator to wager him a large sum of money that his forces would never cross the River
Jordan. To this fair offer, so reports ran, the Gentile officer had replied that he would cross
the Jordan if hell yawned below it; that he had thereupon viciously pulled the ends of a grizzled,
gray moustache and proceeded to behave very much as an officer would be expected to behave
who was commonly known as "old Pat Connor." Here, in front of the governor's residence, where
flew the only American flag to be seen in the whole great city, he had, with entire lack of
dignity, led his men in three cheers for the country, the flag, and the Gentile governor.

After this offensive demonstration, he had perpetrated the supreme indignity by going into
camp on a bench at the base of Wasatch Mountain, in plain sight of the city, there in the light
of day training his guns upon it, and leaving a certain twelve-pound howitzer ranged precisely
upon the residence of the Lion of the Lord.

Little by little these galling reports revived the military spirit in an Elder far to the south,
who had thought that all passion was burned out of him. But this man chanced to open a certain
Bible one night to a page with a wash of blood across it. From this page there seemed to come
such cries and screams of fear in the high voices of women and children, such sounds of blows
on flesh, and the warm, salt smell of blood, that he shut the book and hastily began to pray.
He actually prayed for the preservation of that ancient first enemy of his Church, the government
of the United States. Individually and collectively, as a nation, as States, and as people,
he forgave them and prayed the Lord to hold them undivided.

Then he knew that an astounding miracle of grace had been wrought within him. For this prayer
for the hostile government was thus far his greatest spiritual triumph.

CHAPTER XXVIII.

Just Before the End of the World

The years of the Civil War passed by, and the prayer of Joel Rae was answered. But the time
was now rapidly approaching when the Son of Man was to come in person to judge Israel and begin
his reign of a thousand years on the purified earth. The Twelve, confirmed by Brigham, had
long held that this day of wrath would not be deferred past 1870. In the mind of Joel Rae the
time had thus been authoritatively fixed. The date had been further confirmed by the fulfilment
of Joseph's prophecy of war. The great event was now to be prepared for and met in all readiness.

It was at this time that he betrayed in the pulpit a leaning toward views that many believed
to be heterodox. "A likely man is a likely man," he preached, "and a good man is a good man--whether
in this Church or out of it." He also went so far as to intimate that being in the Church would
not of itself suffice to the attainment of glory; that there were, to put it bluntly, all kinds
of fish in the gospel net; sinners not a few in Zion who would have to be forgiven their misdeeds
seventy times seven on that fateful day drawing near.

Bishop Wright, who followed him on this Sabbath, was bold to speak to another effect.

"Me and my brethren," he insisted, "have received our endowments, keys, and blessings--all
the tokens and signs that can be given to man for his entrance through the celestial gate.
If you have had these in the house of the Lord, when you depart this life you will be able
to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels that stand as sentinels; because
why?--because you can give them the tokens, signs, and grips pertaining to the holy priesthood
and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell. But how about the likely and good
man outside this Church who has rejected the message of the Book of Mormon and ain't got these
signs and passwords? If he's going to be let in, too, why have doorkeepers, and what's the
use of the whole business? Why in time did the Lord go to all this trouble, any way, if Brother
Rae is right? Why was Joseph Smith visited by an angel clad in robes of light, who told him
where the golden plates had been hid up by the Lord, and the Urim and Thummim, and who laid
hands on him and give him the Holy Ghost? And after all that trouble He's took, do you think
He's going to let everybody in? Not much, Mary Ann! The likely men may come the roots on some
of our soft-hearted Elders, but they won't fool the Lord's Christ and His angel gatekeepers."

Elder Beil Wardle, on the other hand, showed a tendency to side with the liberalism of Brother
Rae. He cited the fact that not all revelations were from God. Some were from perverse human
spirits and some from the very Devil himself. There was Elder Sidney Roberts, who had once
suffered a revelation that a certain brother must give him a suit of finest broadcloth and
a gold watch, the best to be had; and another revelation directing him to salute all the younger
sisters, married or single, with a kiss of holiness. Urged to confess that these revelations
were from the Devil, he had refused, and so had been cut off and delivered over to the buffetings
of Satan in the flesh.

"And you can't always be sure of the Holy Ghost, either," he continued. "When the Lord pours
out the Holy Ghost on an individual, he will have spasms, and you would think he was going
to have fits; but it don't make him get up and go pay his debts--not by a long shot. Of course
I don't feel to mention any names, but what can you expect, anyway? A flock of a thousand sheep
has got to be mighty clean if some of them ain't smutty. This is a large flock of sheep that
has come up into this valley of the mountains, and some of them have got tag-locks hanging
about them. But it don't seem to pester the Lord any. He sifted us good in Missouri, and He
put us into another sieve at Nauvoo, and I reckon His sieve will be brought along with Him
on the day of judgment. And if there are some lost sheep in the fold of Zion, maybe, on the
other hand, there's some outside the fold that will be worth saving; that will be broke off
from the wild olive-tree and grafted on to the tame olive-tree to partake of its sap and fatness."

Joel Rae would have taken more comfort in this championship of his views if it were not for
his suspicion that Elder Wardle sometimes spoke in a tone of levity, and had indeed more than
once been reckoned as a doubter. It was even related of him that a perverted sense of humour
had once inspired him to deliver an irreverent and wholly immaterial address in pure Choctaw
at a service where many others of the faithful had been moved to speak in tongues; and that
an earnest sister, believing the Holy Ghost to be strong upon her, had thereupon arisen and
interpreted his speech to be the Lord's description of the glories of their new temple, which
it had not been at all. Such a man might have a good heart, as he knew Elder Wardle to have;
but he must be an inferior guide to the Father's presence. He was even less inclined to trust
him when Wardle announced confidentially at the close of the meeting that day, "Brother Wright
talks a good deal jest to hear his head roar. You'd think he'd been the midwife at the borning
of the world, and helped to nurse it and bring it up--he's that knowing about it. My opinion
is he don't know twice across or straight up about the Lord's secret doings!"

Yet if he had sought to render a little elastic the rigid teachings of the priesthood, he had
done so innocently. The foundations of his faith were unshaken; for him the rock upon which
his Church was built had never been more stable. As to doubting its firmness, he would as soon
have blasphemed the Holy Ghost or disputed the authority of Brigham, with whom was the sacred
deposit of doctrine and all temporal and spiritual power.

So he sighed often for those Gentile sheep on whom the wrath of God was so soon to fall. Even
with the utmost stretching of the divine mercy, the greater part of them must perish; and for
the lost souls of these he grieved much and prayed each day.

It was more than ten years since that day in the Meadows, and the blight there put upon his
person had waxed with each year. His hair showed now but the faintest sprinkle of black, his
shoulders were bent and rounded as if bearing invisible burdens, and his face had the look
of drooping in grief and despair, as one who was made constantly to look upon all the suffering
of all the world. Yet he wore always, except when alone, a not unpleasant little effort of
a smile, as if he would conceal his pain. But this deceived few. The women of the settlement
had come to call him "the little man of sorrows." Even his wife, Lorena, had divined that his
mind was not one with hers; that, somehow, there was a gulf between them which her best-meant
cheerfulness could not span. In a measure she had ceased to try, doing little more than to
sing, when he was near, some hymn which she considered suitable to his condition. One favourite
at such times began:--

  "Lord, we are vile, conceived in sin,
   And born unholy and unclean;
   Sprung from the man whose guilty fall
   Corrupts his race and taints us all.

  "Soon as we draw our infant breath,
   The seeds of sin grow up for death;
   The law demands a perfect heart,
   But we're defiled in every part."

She would sing many verses of this with appealing unction, so long as he was near; yet when
he came upon her unawares he might hear her voicing some cheerful, secular ballad, like--

  "As I went down to Coffey's mills
     Some pleasure for to see,
   I fell in love with a railroad-er,
     He fell in love with me."

The stolid Christina listened entranced to all of Lorena's songs, charmed by the melody not
less than she was awed by her sister-wife's superior gifts of language. The husband, too, listened
not without resignation, reflecting that, when Lorena did not sing, she talked. For the unspeaking
Christina he had learned to feel an admiration that bordered upon reverence, finding in her
silence something spiritually great. Yet of the many-worded Lorena he was never heard to complain
through all the years. The nearest he approached to it was on a day when Elder Beil Wardle
had sought to condole with him on the affliction of her ready speech.

"That woman of yours," said this observant friend, "sure takes large pie-bites out of any little
talk that happens to get going."

"She does have the gift of continuance," her husband had admitted. But he had added, hastily,
"Though her heart is perfect with the Lord."

The fact that she was sealed to him for eternity, and that she believed she would constitute
one of his claims to exaltation in the celestial world, were often matters of pious speculation
with him. He wondered if he had done right by her. She deserved a husband who would be saved
into the kingdom, while he who had married her was irrevocably lost.

There had been a time when he read with freshened hope the promises of forgiveness in that
strange New Testament. Once he had even believed that these might save him; that he was again
numbered with the elect. But when this belief had grown firm, so that he could seem to rest
his weight upon it, he felt it fall away to nothing under him, and the truth he had divined
that day in the desert was again bared before him. He saw that how many times soever God might
forgive the sins of a man, it would avail that man nothing unless he could forgive himself.
He knew at last that in his own soul was fixed a gauge of right, unbending and implacable when
wrong had been done, waiting to be reckoned with at the very last even though the great God
should condone his sin. It seemed to him that, however surely his endowments took him through
the gates of the Kingdom, with whatsoever power they raised him to dominion; even though he
came into the Father's presence and sat a throne of his own by the side of Joseph and Brigham,
that there would still ring in his ears the cries of those who had been murdered at the priesthood's
command; that there would leap before his eyes fountains of blood from the breasts of living
women who knelt and clung to the knees of their slayers--to the knees of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints; that he would see two spots of white in the dim light of a morning
where the two little girls lay who had been sent for water; that he would see the two boys
taken out to the desert, one to die at once, the other to wander to a slower death; that before
his sinful eyes would come the dying face of the woman who had loved him and lost her soul
rather than betray him. He knew that, even in celestial realms exalted beyond the highest visions
of their priesthood, his soul would still burn in this fire that he could not extinguish within
his own breast. He knew that he carried hell as an inseparable part of himself, and that the
forgiveness of no other power could avail him. He no longer feared God, but himself alone.

From this fire of his own building it seemed to him that he could obtain surcease only by reducing
the self within him. As surely as he let it feel a want, all the torture came back upon him.
When his pride lifted up its head, when he desired any satisfaction for himself, when he was
tempted for a moment to lay down his cross, the cries came back, the sea of blood surged before
him, and close behind came the shapes that crawled or moved furtively, ever about to spring
in front and turn upon him. Small wonder, then, that his shoulders bent beneath unseen burdens,
that his air was of one who suffered for all the world, and that they called him "the little
man of sorrows."

With this knowledge he learned to permit himself only one great love, a love for the child
Prudence. He was sure that no punishment could come through that. It was his day-star and his
life, the one pleasure that brought no suffering with it. She was a child of fourteen now,
a half-wild, firm-fleshed, glowing creature of the out-of-doors, who had lost with her baby
softness all her resemblance to her mother. Her hair and eyes had darkened as she grew, and
she was to be a larger woman, graver, deeper, more reserved; perhaps better calculated for
the Kingdom by reason of a more reflective mind. He adored her, and was awed by her even when
he taught her the truths of revealed religion. He closed his eyes at night upon a never-ending
prayer for her soul; and opened them each day to a love of her that grew insidiously to enthrall
him while he was all unconscious of its power--even while he knew with an awful certainty that
he must have no treasure of his own which he could not willingly relinquish at the first call.
She, in turn, loved and confided in her father, the shy, bent, shrunken little man with the smile.

"He always smiles as if he'd hurt himself and didn't want to show it before company," were
the words in which she announced one of her early discoveries about him. But she liked and
ruled him, and came to him for comfort when she was hurt or when Lorena scolded. For the third
wife did not hesitate to characterise the child as "ready-made sin," and to declare that it
took all her spare time, "and a lot that ain't spare," to neat up the house after her. "And
her paw--though Lord knows who her maw was--a-dressing her to beat the cars; while he ain't
never made over me since the blessed day I married him--not that much! But, thank heavens,
it can't last very long, with the Son of Man already started, like you might say." It is true
that in the north, as the appointed year drew nigh, an opinion had begun to prevail that the
Son of Man might defer his coming; and presently it became known that Brigham himself was doubtful
about the year 1870, and was inspiring others to doubt. But in Amalon they were untainted by
this heresy, choosing to rely upon what Brigham had said in moments more inspired.

He had taught that Joseph was to be the first person resurrected; that after his frame had
been knit together and clothed with immortal flesh he would resurrect those who had died in
the faith, according to their rank in the priesthood; then all his wives and children. Resurrected
Elders, having had the keys of the resurrection conferred upon them by Joseph, would in turn
call from the grave their own households; and when the last of the faithful had come forth,
another great work would be performed; the Gentiles would then be resurrected to act as servants
and slaves to the Saints. In his lighter moments Brigham had been wont to name a couple of
Presidents of the United States who would then act as his valets.

Some doubt had been expressed that the earth's surface could contain the resurrected host,
but Apostle Orson Pratt had removed this. He cited the prophet who had foretold that the hills
should be laid low, the valleys exalted, and the crooked places made straight. With the earth
thus free of mountains and waste places, he had demonstrated that there would be an acre and
a quarter of ground for each Saint that had ever lived from the morning of creation to the
day of doom. And, lest some carping mathematician should dispute his figures, he had declared
that if, by any miscalculation, the earth's surface should not suffice for the Saints and their
Gentile slaves, the Lord "would build a gallery around the earth." Thus had confusion been
brought to the last quibbler in Zion.

It was this earlier teaching that the faithful of Amalon clung to, perhaps not a little by
reason that immediately over them was a spiritual guide who had been trained from infancy to
know that salvation lay in belief,--never in doubt. For a sign of the end they believed that
on the night before the day of it there would be no darkness. This would be as it had been
before the birth of the Saviour, as told in the Book of Mormon: "At the going down of the sun
there was no darkness, and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness
when the night came; and there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as if
it were midday."

They talked of little but this matter in that small pocket of the intermountain commonwealth,
in Sabbath meetings and around the hearths at night. The Wild Ram of the Mountains thought
all proselyting should cease in view of the approaching end; that the Elders on mission should
withdraw from the vineyard, shake the dust from their feet, and seal up the rebellious Gentiles
to damnation. To this Elder Beil Wardle had replied, somewhat testily:

"Well, now, since these valleys of Ephraim have got a little fattened a whole lot of us have
got the sweeny, and our skins are growing too tight on our flesh." He had been unable to comprehend
that the Gentiles were a rejected lot, the lost sheep of the house of Israel. On this occasion
it had required all the tact of Elder Rae to soothe the two good men into an amiable discussion
of the time when Sidney Rigdon went to the third heaven and talked face to face with God. They
had agreed in the end, however, that they were both of the royal seed of Abraham, and were
on the grand turnpike to exaltation.

To these discussions and sermons the child, Prudence, listened with intense interest, looking
forward to the last day as an occasion productive of excitement even superior to that of her
trips to Salt Lake City, where her father went to attend the October conference, and where
she was taken to the theatre.

Of any world outside the valley she knew but little. Somewhere, far over to the east, was a
handful of lost souls for whom she sometimes indulged in a sort of luxurious pity. But their
loss, after all, was a part of the divine plan, and they would have the privilege of serving
the glorified Saints, even though they were denied Godhood. She half-believed that even this
mission of service was almost more of glory than they merited; for, in the phrasing of Bishop
Wright, they "made a hell all the time and raised devils to keep it going." They had slain
the Prophets of the Lord and hunted his people, and the best of them were lucky, indeed, to
escape the fire that burns unceasingly; a fire hotter than any made by beech or hickory. Still
she sometimes wondered if there were girls among them like her; and she had visions of herself
as an angel of light, going down to them with the precious message of the Book of Mormon, and
bringing them into the fold.

One day in this spring when she was fourteen, the good Bishop Wright, on his way down from
Box Cañon with a load of wood, saw her striding up the road ahead of him. Something caught
his eye, either in her step which had a child's careless freedom, or in the lines of her swinging
figure that told of coming womanhood, or in the flashing, laughing appeal of her dark eyes
where for the moment both woman and child looked out. He set the brake on his wagon and waited
for her to pass. She came by with a smile and a word of greeting, to which his rapt attention
prevented any reply except a slight nod. When she had passed, he turned and looked after her
until she had gone around the little hill on the road that entered the cañon.

After the early evening meal that day, along the many-roomed house of this good man, from door
to door there ran the words, starting from her who had last been sealed to him:

"He's making himself all proud!"

They knew what it meant, and wondered whom.

A little later the Bishop set out, his face clean-shaven to the ruffle of white whisker that
ran under his chin from ear to ear, his scant hair smooth and shining with grease from the
largest bear ever trapped in the Pine Mountains, and his tall form arrayed in his best suit
of homespun. As he went he trolled an ancient lay of love, and youth was in his step. For there
had come all day upon this Prince of Israel those subtle essences distilled by spring to provoke
the mating urge. At the Rae house he found only Christina.

"Where's Brother Joel, Sister Rae?"

"Himself has gone out there," Christina had answered with a wave of her hand, and using the
term of respect which she always applied to her husband.

He went around the house, out past the stable and corrals and across the irrigating ditch to
where he saw Joel Rae leaning on the rail fence about the peach orchard. Far down between two
rows of the blossoming trees he could see the girl reaching up to break off a pink-sprayed
bough. He quickened his pace and was soon at the fence.

"Brother Joel,--I--the--"

The good man had been full of his message a moment before, but now he stammered and hesitated
because of something cold in the other's eye as it seemed to note the unwonted elegance of
his attire. He took a quick breath and went on.

"You see the Lord has moved me to add another star to my crown."

"I see; and you have come to get me to seal you?"

"Well, of course I hadn't thought of it so soon, but if you want to do it to-night--"

"As soon as you like, Bishop,--the sooner the better if you are to save the soul of another
woman against the day of desolation. Where is she?" and he turned to go back to the house.
But the Bishop still paused, looking toward the orchard.

"Well, the fact is, Brother Joel, you see the Lord has made me feel to have Prudence for another
star in my crown of glory--your daughter Prudence," he repeated as the other gazed at him with
a sudden change of manner.

"My daughter Prudence--little Prue--that child--that baby?"

"Baby?--she's fourteen; she was telling my daughter Mattie so jest the other day, and the Legislatur
has made the marrying age twelve for girls and fifteen for boys, so she's two years overtime
already. Of course, I ain't fifteen, but I'm safer for her than some young cub."

"But Bishop--you don't consider--"

"Oh, of course, I know there's been private talk about her; nobody knows who her mother was,
and they say whoever she was you was never married to her, so she couldn't have been born right,
but I ain't bigoted like some I could name, and I stand ready to be her Saviour on Mount Zion."

He waited with something of noble concession in his mien.

The other seemed only now to have fully sensed the proposal, and, with real terror in his face,
he began to urge the Bishop toward the house, after looking anxiously back to where the child
still lingered with the mist of pink blossoms against the leafless boughs above her.

"Come, Brother Seth--come, I beg of you--we'll talk of it--but it can't be, indeed it can't!"

"Let's ask her," suggested the Bishop, disinclined to move.

"Don't, don't ask her!" He seized the other by the arm.

"Come, I'll explain; don't ask her now, at any rate--I beg of you as a gentleman--as a gentleman,
for you are a gentleman."

The Bishop turned somewhat impatiently, then remarked with a dignified severity:

"Oh, I can be a gentleman whenever it's necessary!"

They went across the fields toward the house, and the Bishop spoke further.

"There ain't any need to get into your high-heeled boots, Brother Rae, jest because I was aiming
to save her to a crown of glory,--a girl that's thought to have been born on the wrong side
of the blanket!"

They stopped by the first corral, and Joel Rae talked. He talked rapidly and with power, saying
many things to make it plain that he was determined not to look upon the Wild Ram of the Mountains
as an acceptable son-in-law. His manner was excited and distraught, terrified and indignant,--a
manner hardly justified by the circumstances, about which there was nothing extraordinary,
nothing not pleasing to God and in conformity to His revealed word. Bishop Wright indeed was
puzzled to account for the heat of his manner, and in recounting the interview later to Elder
Wardle, he threw out an intimation about strong drink. "To tell you the truth," he said, "I
suspicion he'd jest been putting a new faucet in the cider barrel."

When Prudence came in from the blossoming peach-trees that night her father called her to him
to sit on his lap in the dusk while the crickets sang, and grow sleepy as had been her baby habit.

"What did Bishop Wright want?" she asked, after her head was pillowed on his arm. Relieved
that it was over, now even a little amused, he told her:

"He wanted to take my little girl away, to marry her."

She was silent for a moment, and then:

"Wouldn't that be fine, and we could build each other up in the Kingdom."

He held her tighter.

"Surely, child, you couldn't marry him?"

"But of course I could! Isn't he tried in the Kingdom, so he is sure to have all those thrones
and dominions and power?"

"But child, child! That old man with all his wives--"

"But they say old men are safer than young men. Young men are not tried in the Kingdom. I shouldn't
like a young husband anyway--they always want to play rough games, and pull your hair, and
take things away from you, and get in the way."

"But, baby,--don't, don't--"

"Why, you silly father, your voice sounds as if you were almost crying--please don't hold me
so tight--and some one must save me before the Son of Man comes to judge the quick and the
dead; you know a woman can't be saved alone. I think Bishop Wright would make a fine husband,
and I should have Mattie Wright to play with every day."

"And you would leave me?"

"Why, that's so, Daddy! I never thought--of course I can't leave my little sorry father--not
yet. I forgot that. I couldn't leave you. Now tell me about my mother again."

He told her the story she already knew so well--how beautiful her mother was, the look of her
hair and eyes, her slenderness, the music of her voice, and the gladness of her laugh.

"And won't she be glad to see us again. And she will come before Christina and Lorena, because
she was your first wife, wasn't she?"

He was awake all night in a fever of doubt and rebellion. By the light of the candle, he read
in the book of Mormon passages that had often puzzled but never troubled him until now when
they were brought home to him; such as, "And now it came to pass that the people Nephi under
the reign of the second king began to grow hard in their hearts, and indulged themselves somewhat
in wicked practises, like unto David of old, desiring many wives--"

Again he read, "Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives, which thing was abominable
before me, saith the Lord."

Still again, "For there shall not be any man among you have save it shall be one wife."

He turned from one to the other; from the many explicit admonitions and commands against polygamy,
the denunciations of the patriarchs for their indulgence in the practise, to this last passage
contradicting the others, and vexed himself with wonder. In the Book of Mormon, David was said
to be wicked for doing this thing. Now in the revelation to Joseph he read, "David's wives
were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant."

He recalled old tales that were told in Nauvoo by wicked apostates and the basest of Gentile
scandalmongers; how that Joseph in the day of his great power had suffered the purity of his
first faith to become tainted; how his wife, Emma, had upbraided him so harshly for his sins
that he, fearing disgrace, had put out this revelation as the word of God to silence her.

This was the calumny the Gentile gossips back in Nauvoo would have had the world believe,--that
this great doctrine of the Church had been given to silence the enraged wife of a man detected
in sin.

But in the midst of his questionings he seemed to see a truth,--that another snare had been
set for him by the Devil, and that this time it had caught his feet. He, who knew that he must
have nothing for himself, had all unconsciously so set his heart upon this child of her mother
that he could not give her up. And now so fixed and so great was his love that he could not
turn back. He knew he was lost. To cling to her would be to question, doubt, and to lose his
faith. To give her up would kill him.

But at least for a little while he could put it off.

CHAPTER XXX.

How the World Did not Come to an End

In doubt and fear, the phantom of a dreadful certainty creeping always closer, the final years
went by. When the world came to be in its very last days, when the little bent man was drooping
lower than ever, and Prudence was seventeen, there came another Prince of Israel to save her
into the Kingdom while there was yet a time of grace. On this occasion the suitor was no less
a personage than Bishop Warren Snow, a holy man and puissant, upon whom the blessed Gods had
abundantly manifested their favour. In wives and children, in flocks and herds, he was rich;
while, as to spiritual worth, had not that early church poet styled him the Entablature of Truth?

But Prudence Rae, once so willing to be saved by the excellent Wild Ram of the Mountains, had
fled in laughing confusion from this later benefactor, when he had made plain one day the service
he sought to do her soul. A moment later he had stood before her father in all his years of
patriarchal dignity, hale, ruddy, and vast of girth.

"She's a woman now, Brother Snow,--free to choose for herself," the father had replied to his
first expostulations.

"Counsel her, Brother Rae." In the mind of the Bishop, "counsel," properly applied, was a thing
not long to be resisted.

"She would treat my counsel as shortly as she treated your proposal, Brother Snow."

The Entablature of Truth glanced out of the open door to where Tom Potwin could be seen, hastening
importantly upon his endless and mysterious errands, starting off abruptly a little way, stopping
suddenly, with one hand raised to his head, as if at that instant remembering a forgotten detail,
and then turning with new impetus to walk swiftly in the opposite direction.

"There ain't any one else after her, is there, Brother Rae,--any of these young boys?"

"No, Bishop--no one."

"Well, if there is, you let me know. I'll be back again, Brother Rae. Meantime, counsel her--counsel
her with authority."

The Entablature of Truth had departed with certain little sidewise noddings of his head that
seemed to indicate an unalterable purpose.

The girl came to her father, blushing and still laughing confusedly, when the rejected one
had mounted his horse and ridden away.

"Oh, Daddy, how funny!--to think of marrying him!"

He looked at her anxiously. "But you wanted to marry Bishop Wright--at least, you--"

She laughed again. "How long ago--years ago--I must have been a baby."

"You were old enough to point out that he would save you in the after-time."

"I remember; I could see myself sitting by him on a throne, with the Saints all around us on
other thrones, and the Gentiles kneeling to serve us. We were in a big palace that had a hundred
closets in it, and in every closet there hung a silk dress for me--a hundred silk dresses,
each a different colour, waiting for me to wear them."

"But have you thought sufficiently--now? The time is short. Bishop Snow could save you."

"Yes--but he would kiss me--he wanted to just now." She put both hands over her mouth, with
a mocking little grimace that the Entablature of Truth would not have liked to see.

"He would be certain to exalt you."

She took the hands away long enough to say, "He would be certain to kiss me."

"You may be lost."

"I'd rather!"

And so it had ended between them. Ever since a memorable visit to Salt Lake City, where she
had gone to the theatre, she had cherished some entirely novel ideas concerning matrimony.
In that fairyland of delights she had beheld the lover strangely wooing but one mistress, the
husband strangely cherishing but one wife. There had been no talk of "the Kingdom," and no
home portrayed where there were many wives. That lover, swearing to cherish but one woman for
ever, had thrilled her to new conceptions of her own womanhood, had seemed to meet some need
of her own heart that she had not until then been conscious of. Ever after, she had cherished
this ideal of the stage, and refused to consider the other. Yet she had told her father nothing
of this, for with her womanhood had come a new reserve--truths half-divined and others clearly
perceived--which she could not tell any one.

He, in turn, now kept secret from her the delight he felt at her refusal. He had tried conscientiously
to persuade her into the path of salvation, when his every word was a blade to cut at his heart.
Nor was he happy when she refused so definitely the saving hand extended to her. To know she
was to come short of her glory in the after-time was anguish to him; and mingling with that
anguish, inflaming and aggravating it, were his own heretical doubts that would not be gone.

In a sheer desperation of bewilderment he longed for the end, longed to know certainly his
own fate and hers--to have them irrevocably fixed--so that he might no more be torn among many
minds, but could begin to pay his own penalties in plain suffering, uncomplicated by this torturing
necessity to choose between two courses of action.

And the time was, happily, to be short. With the first day of 1870 he began to wait. With prayer
and fasting and vigils he waited. Now was the day when the earth should be purified by fire,
the wicked swept from the land, and the lost tribes of Israel restored to their own. Now was
to come the Son of Man who should dwell in righteousness with men, reigning over them on the
purified earth for a thousand years.

He watched the mild winter go, with easy faith; and the early spring come and go, with a dawning
uneasiness. For the time was passing with never the blast of a trumpet from the heavens. He
began to see then that he alone, of all Amalon, had kept his faith pure. For the others had
foolishly sown their fields, as if another crop were to be harvested,--as if they must continue
to eat bread that was earth-grown. Even Prudence had strangely ceased to believe as he did.
Something from the outside had come, he knew not what nor how, to tarnish the fair gold of
her certainty. She had not said so, but he divined it when he shrewdly observed that she was
seeking to comfort him, to support his own faith when day after day the Son of Man came not.

"It will surely be in another month, Daddy--perhaps next week--perhaps to-morrow," she would
say cheerfully. "And you did right not to put in any crops. It would have been wicked to doubt."

He quickly detected her insincerity, seeing that she did not at all believe. As the summer
came and went without a sign from the heavens, she became more positive and more constant in
these assurances. As the evening drew on, they would walk out along the unsown fields, now
grown rankly to weeds, to where the valley fell away from their feet to the west. There they
could look over line after line of hills, each a little dimmer as it lay farther into the blue
through which they saw it, from the bold rim of the nearest shaggy-sided hill to the farthest
feathery profile all but lost in the haze. Day after day they sat together here and waited
for the sign,--for the going down of the sun upon a night when there should be no darkness;
when the light should stay until the sun came back over the eastern verge; when the trumpet
should wind through the hills, and when the little man's perplexities, if not his punishment,
should be at an end.

And always when the dusk came she would try to cheer him to new hope for the next night, counting
the months that remained in the year, the little time within which the great white day must
be. Then they would go back through the soft light of the afterglow, he with his bent shoulders
and fallen face, shrunk and burned out, except for the eyes, and she in the first buoyant flush
of her womanhood, free and strong and vital, a thing of warmth and colour and luring curve,
restraining her quick young step to his, as she suppressed now a world of strange new fancies
to his soberer way of thought. When they reached home again, her words always were: "Never
mind, Daddy--it must come soon--there's only a little time left in the year."

It was on these occasions that he knew she was now the stronger, that he was leaning on her,
had, in fact, long made her his support--fearfully, lest she be snatched away. And he knew
at last that another change had come with her years; that she no longer confided in him unreservedly,
as the little child had. He knew there were things now she could not give him. She communed
with herself, and her silences had come between them. She looked past him at unseen forms,
and listened as if for echoes that she alone could hear, waiting and wanting, knowing not her
wants--yet driven to aloofness by them from the little bent man of sorrows, whose whole life
she had now become.

His hope lasted hardly until the year ended. Before the time was over, there had crept into
his mind a conviction that the Son of Man would not come; that the Lord's favour had been withdrawn
from Israel. He knew the cause,--the shedding of innocent blood. They might have made war;
indeed, many of the revelations to Joseph discriminated even between murder and that murder
in which innocent blood should be shed; but the truth was plain. They had shed innocent blood
that day in the Meadows. Now the Lord's favour was withdrawn and His coming deferred, perhaps
another thousand years. The torture of the thing came back to him with all its early colouring,
so that his days and nights were full of anguish. He no longer dared open the Bible to that
reddened page. The cries already rang in his ears, and he knew not what worse torture might
come if he looked again upon the stain; nor could he free himself from these by the old expedient
of prayer, for he could no longer pray with an honest heart; he was no longer unselfish, could
no longer kneel in perfect submission; he was wholly bound to this child of her mother, and
the peace of absolute and utter sacrifice could not come back to him. Full of unrest, feeling
that somehow the end, at least for him, could not be far off, he went north to the April Conference.
He took Prudence with him, not daring to leave her behind.

She went with high hopes, alive with new sensations. Another world lay outside her valley of
the mountains, and she was going to peep over the edge at its manifold fascinations. She had
been there before as a child; now she was going as a woman. She remembered the city, bigger
and grander than fifty Amalons, with magnificent stores filled with exotic novelties and fearsome
luxuries from the land of the wicked Gentile. She recalled even the strange advertisements
and signs, from John and Enoch Reese, with "All necessary articles of comfort for the wayfarer,
such as flour, hard bread, butter, eggs and vinegar, buckskin pants and whip-lashes," to the
"Surgeon Dentist from Berlin and Liverpool," who would "Examine and Extract Teeth, besides
keeping constantly on hand a supply of the Best Matches, made by himself." From William Hennefer,
announcing that, "In Connection with my Barber Shop, I have just opened an Eating House, where
Patrons will be Accommodated with every Edible Luxury the Valley Affords," to William Nixon,
who sold goods for cash, flour, or wheat "at Jacob Hautz's house on the southeast corner of
Council-House Street and Emigration Square, opposite to Mr. Orson Spencer's."

More fondly did she recall two wonderful evenings at the theatre. First had been the thrilling
"Robert Macaire," then the romantic "Pizarro," in which Rolla had been a being of such overwhelming
beauty that she had felt he could not be of earth.

This time her visit was an endless fever of discovery in a realm of magic and mystery, of joys
she had supposed were held in reserve for those who went behind the veil. It was a new and
greater city she came to now, where were buildings of undreamed splendour, many of them reaching
dizzily three stories above the earth. And the shops were more fascinating than ever. She still
shuddered at the wickedness of the Gentiles, but with a certain secret respect for their habits
of luxury and their profusion of devices for adornment.

And there were strange new faces to be seen, people surely of a different world, of a different
manner from those she had known, wearing, with apparent carelessness, garments even more strangely
elegant than those in the shop windows, and speaking in strange, soft accents. She was told
that these were Gentiles, tourists across the continent, who had ventured from Ogden to observe
the wonders of the new Zion. The thought of the railroad was in itself thrilling. To be so
near that wonderful highway to the land of the evil-doers and to a land, alas! of so many strange
delights. She shuddered at her own wickedness, but fell again and again, and was held in bondage
by the allurements about her. So thrilled to her soul's center was she that the pleasure of
it hurt her, and the tears would come to her eyes until she felt she must be alone to cry for
the awful joy of it.

The evening brought still more to endure, for they went to the play. They break, plot, warbles.

 His kingship in things material no less than in things spiritual had been absolute,
undisputed, undoubted--indeed, gloried in by the people as much as Brigham himself gloried
when he declared it in and out of the tabernacle. Their blind obedience had been his by divine
right, by virtue of his iron will, his matchless courage, his tireless spirit, and his understanding
of their hearts and their needs, born of his common suffering with them. Nothing could be done
without his sanction. No man could enter a business, or change his home from north to south,
without first securing his approval; even the merchants who went east or west for goods must
first report to him their wishes, to see if he had contrary orders for them! From the invitation
list of a ball to the financing of a corporation, his word was law; in matters of marriage
as well--no man daring even to seek a wife until the Prophet had approved his choice. The whole
valley for five hundred miles was filled with his power as with another air that the Saints
must breathe. In his oft-repeated own phrase, it was his God-given right to dictate all matters,
"even to the ribbons a woman should wear, or the setting up of a stocking." And his people
had not only submitted blindly to his rule, but had reverenced and even loved him for it.

Twenty-five years of such allegiance, preceded by a youth in which the same gospel of obedience
was bred into his marrow--this was not to be thrown off by a mere heartache; not to be more
than striven against, half-heartedly, in the first moment of anguish.

He thought of Brigham's home in the Lion House, the score or so of plain, elderly women, hard-working,
simple-minded; the few favourites of his later years, women of sightlier exteriors; and he
pictured the long dining-room, where, at three o'clock each afternoon, to the sound of a bell,
these wives and half a hundred children marched in, while the Prophet sat benignantly at the
head of the table and blessed the meal. He tried to fix Prudence in this picture, but at every
effort he saw, not her, the shy, sweet woman, full of surprised tenderness, but a creature
hardened, debased, devoid of charm, dehumanised, a brood-beast of the field.

And yet this was not rebellion. His mind was clear as to that. He could not refuse, even had
refusal not been to incur the severest penalties both in this world and in the world to come.
The habit of obedience was all-powerful.

Presently he saw Prudence coming across the fields in the late afternoon from the road that
led to the cañon. He watched her jealously until she drew near, then called her to him. In
a few words he told her very gravely the honour that was to be done her.

When she fully understood, he noted that her mind seemed to attain an unusual clearness, her
speech a new conciseness; that she was displaying a force of will he had never before suspected.

Her reply, in effect, was that she would not marry Brigham Young if all the angels in heaven
came to entreat her; that the thought was not a pretty one; and that the matter might be considered
settled at that very moment. "It's too silly to talk about," she concluded.

Almost fearfully he looked at her, yielding a little to her spirit of rebellion, yet trying
not to yield; trying not to rejoice in the amused flash of her dark eyes and the decision of
her tones. But then, as he looked, and as she still faced him, radiant in her confidence, he
felt himself going with her--plunging into the tempting wave of apostasy.

CHAPTER XXXII.

A New Face in the Dream

In a settled despair the little bent man waited for the end. Already he felt himself an outcast
from Israel. In spirit he had disobeyed the voice of Brigham, which was the voice of God; exulting
sinfully in spite of himself in this rebellion. Praying to be bowed and bent and broken, to
have all trace of the evil self within him burned out, he had now let that self rise up again
to cry out a want. Praying that crosses might daily be added to his burden, he had now refused
to take up one the bearing of which might have proved to Heaven the extinction of his last
selfish desire. He had been put to the test, as he prayed to be, and he had failed miserably
to meet it. And now he knew that even his life was waning with his faith.

During the year when he waited for the end of the world, he had been nerved to an unwonted
vigour. Now he was weak and fit for no further combat. He waited, with an indifference that
amazed him, for the day when he should openly defy Brigham, and have penalties heaped upon him.

First he would be ordered on a mission to some far corner of the world. It would mean that
he must go alone, "without purse or scrip," leaving Prudence. He would refuse to go. Thereupon
he would be sternly disfellowshiped. Then, having become an apostate, he would be a fair mark
for many things, perhaps for simple persecution--perhaps for blood atonement. He had heard
Brigham himself say in the tabernacle that he was ready to "unsheathe his bowie knife" and
send apostates "to hell across lots."

He was ready to welcome that. It were easier to die now than to live; and, as for being cut
off from his glory in the after-time, he had already forfeited that; would miss it even if
he died in fellowship with Brigham and full of churchly honours; would miss it even if the
power on high should forgive him,--for he himself, he knew, could not forgive his own sin.
So it was little matter about his apostasy, and Prudence should be saved from a wifehood that,
ever since he had pictured her in it, had seemed to him for the first time unspeakably bad.

They talked but little about it that day, after her first abrupt refusal. There was too much
for each of them to think of. He was obliged to dwell upon the amazing fact that he must lie
in hell until he could win his own forgiveness, regardless of what gentle pardoning might be
his from God. This, to him, simple and obvious truth, was now his daily torture.

As for Prudence, she had to be alone to dream her dreams of a love that should be always single.
Brigham's letter, far from disturbing these, had brought them a zest hitherto lacking. Neither
the sacrilege of refusing him, its worldly unwisdom, nor its possible harm to the little bent
man of sorrows, had as yet become apparent to her. Each day, when such duties as were hers
in the house had been performed, she walked out to be alone,--always to Box Cañon, that green-sided
cleft in the mountain, with the brook lashing itself to a white fury over the boulders at the
bottom. She would go up out of the hot valley into its cool freshness and its pleasant wood
smells, and there, in the softened blue light of a pine-hung glade, she would rest, and let
her fancy build what heaven-reaching towers it would. On some brown bed of pine-needles, or
on a friendly gray boulder close by the water-side, where she could give her eyes to its flow
and foam, and her ears to its music,--music like the muffled tinkling of little silver bells
in the distance,--she would let herself go out to her dream with the joyous, reckless abandon
of falling water.

It was commonly a dream of a youth in doublet and hose, a plumed cap, and a cloak of purple
satin, who came in the moonlight to the balcony of his love, and sighed his passion in tones
so moving that she thought an angel must have yielded--as did the girl in the balcony who had
let down the scarf to him. She already knew how that girl's heart must have fluttered at the
moment,--how she must have felt that the hands were mad, wicked, uncontrollable hands, no longer
her own.

There was one place in the dream that she managed not without some ingenuity. It had to be
made plain that the lover under the window did not come from a long, six-doored house, with
a wife behind each door; that this girl, pale in the moonlight, with quickening heart and rebellious
hands on the scarf, and arms that should open to him, was to be not only his first wife but
his last; that he was never even to consider so much as the possibility of another, but was
to cleave unto her, and to love her with a single heart for all the days of her life and his own.

There were various ways of bringing this circumstance forward. Usually she had Brigham march
on at the head of his great family and counsel the youth to take more wives, in order that
he should be exalted in the Kingdom. Whereupon the young man would fold his love in his arms
and speak words of scorn, in the same thrilling manner that he spoke his other words, for any
exaltation which they two could not share alone. Brigham, at the head of his wives, would then
slink off, much abashed.

She had come naturally to see her own face as the face of this happily loved girl in the dream.
She knew no face for the youth. There was none in Amalon; not Jarom Tanner, six feet three,
who became a helpless, grinning child in her presence; nor Moroni Peterson, who became a solemn
and ghastly imbecile; nor Ammaron Wright, son of the Bishop, who had opened the dance of the
Young People's Auxiliary with prayer, and later tried to kiss her in a dark corner of the room.
So the face of the other person in her dream remained of an unknown heavenly beauty.

And then one afternoon in early May a strange youth came singing down the cañon; came while
she mused by the brook-side in her best-loved dream. Long before she saw him, she heard his
music, a young, clear, care-free voice ringing down from the trail that went over the mountains
to Kanab and into Kimball Valley; one of the ways that led out to the world that she wondered
about so much. It was a voice new to her, and the words of his ballad were also new. At first
she heard them from afar:--

  "There was a young lady came a-tripping along,
     And at each side a servant-O,
   And in each hand a glass of wine
     To drink with the Gypsy Davy-O.

  "And will you fancy me, my dear,
     And will you be my Honey-O?
   I swear by the sword that hangs by my side
     You shall never want for money-O.

  "Oh, yes, I will fancy you, kind sir,
     And I will be your Honey-O,
   If you swear by the sword that hangs by your side
     I shall never want for money-O."

The singer seemed to be making his way slowly. Far up the trail, she had one fleeting glimpse
of a man on a horse, and then he was hid again in the twilight of the pines. But the music
came nearer:--

  "Then she put on her high-heeled shoes,
     All made of Spanish leather-O,
   And she put on her bonnie, bonnie brown,
     And they rode off together-O.

  "Soon after that, her lord came home
     Inquiring for his lady-O,
   When some of the servants made this reply,
     She's a-gone with the Gypsy Davy-O.

  "Then saddle me my milk-white steed,
     For the black is not so speedy-O,
   And I'll ride all night and I'll ride all day
     Till I overtake my lady-O."

She stood transfixed, something within her responding to the hidden singer, as she had once
heard a closed piano sound to a voice that sang near it. Soon she could get broken glimpses
of him as he wound down the trail, now turning around the end of a fallen tree, then passing
behind a giant spruce, now leaning far back while the horse felt a way cautiously down some
sharp little declivity. The impression was confused,--a glint of red, of blue, of the brown
of the horse, a figure swaying loosely to the horse's movements, and then he was out of sight
again around the big rock that had once fallen from high up on the side of the cañon; but now,
when he came from behind that, he would be squarely in front of her. This recalled and alarmed
her. She began to pick a way over the boulders and across the trail that lay between her and
the edge of the pines, hearing another verse of the song, almost at her ear:--

  "He rode all night and he rode all day,
   Till he came to the far deep water-O,
   Then he stopped and a tear came a-trickling down his cheek,
   For there he saw his lady-O."

Before she could reach a shelter in the pines, while she was poised for the last step that
would take her out of the trail, he was out from behind the rock, before her, almost upon her,
reining his horse back upon its haunches,--then in another instant lifting off his broad-brimmed
hat to her in a gracious sweep. It was the first time she had seen this simple office performed
outside of the theatre.

She looked up at him, embarrassed, and stepped back across the narrow trail, her head down
again, so that he was free to pass. But instead of passing, she became aware that he had dismounted.

When she looked up, he was busily engaged in adjusting something about his saddle, with an
expression of deepest concern in his blue eyes. His hat was on the ground and his yellow hair
glistened where the band had pressed it about his head.

"It's that latigo strap," he remarked, in a tone of some annoyance. "I've had to fix it every
five miles since I left Kanab!" Then looking up at her with a friendly smile: "Dandy most stepped
on you, I reckon."

The amazement of it was that, after her first flurry at the sound of his voice and his half-seen
movements up the trail, it should now seem all so commonplace.

"Oh, no, I was well out of his way."

She started again to cross the trail, stepping quickly, with her eyes down, but again his voice
came, less deliberate this time, and with words in something less than intelligible sequence.

"Excuse me, Miss--but--now how many miles to--what's the name of the nearest settlement--I
suppose you live hereabouts?"

"What did you say?"

"I say is there any place where I could get to stop a day or so in Amalon?"

"Oh--I didn't understand--I think so; at least, my father sometimes--but there's Elder Wardle,
he often takes in travellers."

"You say your father--"

"Not always--I don't know, I'm sure--" she looked doubtful.

"Oh, all right! I'll ask him,--if you'll show me his place."

"It's the first place on the left after you leave the cañon--with the big peach orchard--I'm
not going home just yet."

He stroked the muzzle of the horse.

"Oh, I'm in no hurry, I'm just looking over the country a little. Your father's name is--"

"Ask for Elder Rae--or one of his wives will say if they can keep you over night."

She caught something new in his glance, and felt the blood in her face.

"I must go now--you can find your way--I must go."

"Well, if you must go,"--he picked up his hat,--"but I'll see you again. You'll be coming home
this evening, I reckon?"

"The first house on the left," she answered, and stepped once more across the trail and into
the edge of the pines. She went with the same mien of importance that Tom Potwin wore on his
endless errands; and with quite as little reason, too; for the direction in which she had started
so earnestly would have led her, after a few steps, straight up a granite cliff a thousand
feet high.

When his voice died away and she knew he must be gone, she came out again to her nook beside
the stream where, a moment before, her dream had filled her. But now, though nothing had happened
beyond the riding by of a strange youth, the dream no longer sufficed. In place of the moonlit
balcony was the figure of this young stranger swaying with his horse down between the hollowed
shoulders of the Pine Mountains and reining up suddenly to sweep his broad hat low in front
of her. She was surprised by the clearness with which she could recall the details of his appearance,--a
boyish-looking fellow, with wide-open blue eyes and a sunbrowned face under his yellow hair,
the smallest of moustaches, and a smile of such winning good-humour that it had seemed to force
her own lips apart in answer.

Around the broad, gray hat had been a band of braided silver; when he stepped, the spurs on
his high-heeled boots had jingled and clanked of silver; around his neck with a knot at the
back and the corners flapping down on the front of his blue woollen shirt, had been a white-dotted
handkerchief of scarlet silk; and about his waist was knotted a long scarf of the same colour;
dogskin "chapps" he had worn, fronted with the thick yellowish hair outside; his saddle-bags,
back of the saddle, showing the same fur; his saddle had been of stamped Spanish leather with
a silver capping on the horn and on the circle of the cantle; and on the right of the saddle
she had seen the coils of a lariat of plaited horsehair.

The picture of him stayed in her mind, the sturdy young figure,--rather loose-jointed but with
an easy grace of movement,--and the engaging naturalness of his manner. But after all nothing
had happened save the passing of a stranger, and she must go alone back to her dream. Yet now
the dream might change; a strange youth might come riding out of the east, sitting a sorrel
horse with a star and a white hind ankle, a long rangy neck and strong quarters; and he--the
youth--would wear a broad, gray hat, with a band of silver filigree, a scarlet kerchief at
his throat, a scarlet sash at his waist, and yellow dogskin "chapps."

Still, she thought, he could hardly have a place in the dream. The real youth of the dream
had been of an unearthly beauty, with a rose-leaf complexion and lustrous curls massed above
a brow of marble. The stranger had not been of an unearthly beauty. To be sure, he was very
good to look at, with his wide-open blue eyes and his yellow hair, and he had appeared uncommonly
fresh and clean about the mouth when he smiled at her. But she could not picture him sighing
the right words of love under a balcony in the moonlight. He had looked to be too intensely
business-like.

CHAPTER XXXIII.

The Gentile Invasion

When she came across the fields late in the afternoon, the strange youth's horse was picketed
where the bunch-grass grew high, and the young man himself talked with her father by the corral
bars. She had never realised how old her father was, how weak, and small, and bent, until she
saw him beside this erect young fellow. Her heart went out to the older man with a new sympathy
as she saw his feebleness so sharply in relief against the well-blooded, hard-muscled vigour
of the younger. When she would have passed them, her father called to her.

"Prudence, this is Mr. Ruel Follett. He will stay with us to-night."

The sombrero was off again and she felt the blue eyes seeking hers, though she could not look
up from the ground when she had given her little bow. She heard him say:

"I already met your daughter, sir, at the mouth of the cañon."

She went on toward the house, hearing them resume their talk, the stranger saying, "That horse
can sure carry all the weight you want to put on him and step away good; he'll do it right
at both ends, too--Dandy will--and he's got a mighty tasty lope."

Later she brought him a towel when he had washed himself in the tin basin on the bench outside
the house. He had doffed the "chapps" and hung them on a peg, the scarlet kerchief was also
off, his shirt was open at the neck, and soap and water had played freely over his head. He
took the towel from her with a sputtering, "Thank you," and with a pair of muscular, brown
hands proceeded to scour himself dry until the yellow hair stood about him as a halo--without,
however, in the least suggesting the angelic or even saintly: for his face, from the friction
inflamed to a high degree, was now a mass of red with two inquiring spots of blue near the
upper edge. But then the clean mouth opened in its frank smile, and her own dark lashes had
to fall upon her cheeks until she turned away.

At supper and afterwards Mr. Follett talked freely of himself, or seemed to. He was from the
high plains and the short-grass country, wherever that might be--to the east and south she
gathered. He had grown up in that country, working for his father, who had been an overland
freighter, until the day the railroad tracks were joined at Promontory. He, himself, had watched
the gold and silver spikes driven into the tie of California mahogany two years before; and
then, though they still kept a few wagon trains moving to the mining camps north and south
of the railroad, they had looked for other occupations.

Now their attention was chiefly devoted to mines and cattle. There were great times ahead in
the cattle business. His father remembered when they had killed cattle for their hides and
tallow, leaving the meat to the coyotes. But now, each spring, a dozen men, like himself, under
a herd boss, would drive five thousand head to Leavenworth, putting them through ten or twelve
miles a day over the Abiline trail, keeping them fat and getting good prices for them. There
was plenty of room for the business. "Over yonder across the hills," as Mr. Follett put it.
There was a herding ground four hundred miles wide, east and west, and a thousand miles north
and south, covered with buffalo grass, especially toward the north, that made good stock feed
the year around. He himself had, in winter, followed a herd that drifted from Montana to Texas;
and in summer he had twice ranged from Corpus Christi to Deadwood.

Down in the Panhandle they were getting control of a ranch that would cover five thousand square
miles. Some day they would have every one of its three million acres enclosed with a stout
wire fence. It would be a big ranch, bigger than the whole state of Connecticut--bigger than
Delaware and Rhode Island "lumped together", he had been told. Here they would have the "C
lazy C" brand on probably a hundred and fifty thousand head of cattle. He thought the business
would settle down to this conservative basis with the loose ends of it pulled together; with
closer attention paid to branding, for one thing; branding the calves, so they would no longer
have to rope a full-grown steer, and tie it with a scarf such as he wore about his waist.

But they were also working some placer claims up around Helena, and developing a quartz prospect
over at Carson City. And the freighting was by no means "played out." He, himself, had driven
a six-mule team with one line over the Santa Fé trail, and might have to do it again. The resources
of the West were not exhausted, whatever they might say. A man with a head on him would be
able to make a good living there for some years to come.

Both father and daughter found him an agreeable young man in spite of his being an alien from
the Commonwealth of Israel. He remained with them three days looking over the country about
Amalon, talking with its people and making himself at least not an object of suspicion and
aversion, as the casual Gentile was apt to be. Prudence found herself usually at ease with
him; he was so wholly likable and unassuming. Yet at times he seemed strangely mature and reserved
to her, so that she was just a little awed.

He told her in their evenings many wonder-tales of that outside world where the wicked Gentiles
lived; of populous cities on the western edge of it, and of vast throngs that crowded the interior
clear over to the Atlantic Ocean. She had never realised before what a small handful of people
the Lord had set His hand to save, and what vast numbers He had made with hearts that should
be hardened to the glorious articles of the new covenant.

The wastefulness of it rather appalled her. Out of the world with its myriad millions, only
the few thousand in this valley of the mountains had proved worthy of exaltation. And this
young man was doubtless a fair sample of them,--happy, unthinking, earning perdition by mere
carelessness. If only there were a way to save them--if only there were a way to save even
this one--but she hardly dared speak to him of her religion.

When he left he told them he was making a little trip through the settlements to the north,
possibly as far as Cedar City. He did not know how long he would be gone, but if nothing prevented
he might be back that way. He shook hands with them both at parting, and though he spoke so
vaguely about a return, his eyes seemed to tell Prudence that he would like very much to come.
He had talked freely about everything but the precise nature of his errand in the valley.

In her walks to the cañon she thought much of him when he had gone. She could not put his face
into the dream because he was too real and immanent. He and the dream would not blend, even
though she had decided that his fresh-cheeked, clear-eyed face, with its clean smile and the
yellow hair above it was almost better to look at than the face of the youth in the play. It
was not so impalpable; it satisfied. So she mused about them alternately, the dream and the
Gentile,--taking perhaps a warmer interest in the latter for his aliveness, for the grasp of
his hand at parting, which she, with astonishment, had felt her own hand cordially returning.

Her father talked much of the young man. In his prophetic eye this fearless, vigorous young
stranger was the incarnate spirit of that Gentile invasion to which the Lord had condemned
them for their sins. He had come, resourceful, determined, talking of mighty enterprises, of
cattle, and gold, and wheat, of wagon-trains, and railroad,--an eloquent forerunner of the
Gentile hordes that should come west upon the shoulders of Israel, and surround, assimilate,
and reduce them, until they should lose all their powers and gifts and become a mere sect among
sects, their name, perhaps, a hissing and a scorn. He foresaw the invasion of which this self-poised,
vital youth of three or four and twenty was a sapper; and he knew it was a just punishment
from on high for the innocent blood they had shed. Yet now he viewed it rather impersonally,
for he felt curiously disconnected from the affairs of the Church and the world.

He no longer preached on the Sabbath, giving his ill-health as an excuse. In truth he felt
it would not be honest since, in his secret heart, he was now an apostate. But with his works
of healing he busied himself more than ever, and in this he seemed to have gained new power.
Weak as he was physically, gray-haired, bloodless, fragile, with what seemed to be all of his
remaining life burning in his deep-set eyes, he yet laid his hands upon the sick with a success
so marked that his fame spread and he was sent for to rebuke plagues and fevers from as far
away as Beaver.

For two weeks they heard nothing of the wandering Gentile, and Prudence had begun to wonder
if she would ever see him again; also to wonder why an uncertainty in the matter should seem
to be of importance.

But one evening early in June they saw him walking up in the dusk, the light sombrero, the
scarlet kerchief against the blue woollen shirt, the holster with its heavy Colt's revolver
at either hip, the easy moving figure, and the strong, yet boyish face.

He greeted them pleasantly, though, the girl thought, with some restraint. She could not hear
it in his words, but she felt it in his manner, something suppressed and deeply hidden. They
asked where his horse was and he replied with a curious air of embarrassment:--

"Well, you see, I may be obliged to stop around here a quite some while, so I put up with this
man Wardle--not wanting to impose upon you all--and thanking you very kindly, and not wishing
to intrude--so I just came to say 'howdy' to you."

They expressed regret that he had not returned to them, Joel Rae urging him to reconsider;
but he declined politely, showing a desire to talk of other things.

They sat outside in the warm early evening, the young man and Prudence near each other at one
side of the door, while Joel Rae resumed his chair a dozen feet the other side and lapsed into
silence. The two young people fell easily into talk as on the other evenings they had spent
there. Yet presently she was again aware, as in the moment of his greeting, that he laboured
under some constraint. He was uneasy and shifted his chair several times until at length it
was so placed that he could look beyond her to where her father had tilted his own chair against
the house and sat huddled with his chin on his breast. He talked absently, too, at first, of
many things and without sequence; and when he looked at her, there was something back of his
eyes, plain even in the dusk, that she had not seen there before. He was no longer the ingenuous
youth who had come to them from off the Kanab trail.

In a little while, however, this uneasiness seemed to vanish and he was speaking naturally
again, telling of his life on the plains with a boyish enthusiasm; first of the cattle drives,
of the stampede of a herd by night, when the Indians would ride rapidly by in the dark, dragging
a buffalo-robe over the ground at the end of a lariat, sending the frightened steers off in
a mad gallop that made the earth tremble. They would have to ride out at full speed in the
black night, over ground treacherous with prairie-dog holes, to head and turn the herd of frenzied
cattle, and by riding around and around them many times get them at last into a circle and
so hold them until they became quiet again. Often this was not until sunrise, even with the
lullabys they sang "to put them to sleep."

Then he spoke of adventures with the Indians while freighting over the Santa Fé trail, and
of what a fine man his father, Ezra Calkins, was. It was the first time he had mentioned the
name and her ear caught it at once.

"Your father's name is Calkins?"

"Yes--I'm only an adopted son."

Unconsciously she had been letting her voice fall low, making their chat more confidential.
She awoke to this now and to the fact that he had done the same, by noting that he raised his
voice at this time with a casual glance past her to where her father sat.

"Yes--you see my own father and mother were killed when I was eight years old, and the people
that murdered them tried to kill me too, but I was a spry little tike and give them the slip.
It was a bad country, and I like to have died, only there was a band of Navajos out trading
ponies, and one morning, after I'd been alone all night, they picked me up and took care of
me. I was pretty near gone, what with being scared and everything, but they nursed me careful.
They took me away off to the south and kept me about a year, and then one time they took me
with them when they worked up north on a buffalo hunt. It was at Walnut Creek on the big bend
of the Arkansas that they met Ezra Calkins coming along with one of his trains and he bought
me of those Navajos. I remember he gave fifty silver dollars for me to the chief. Well, when
I told him all that I could remember about myself--of course the people that did the killing
scared a good deal of it out of me--he took me to Kansas City where he lived, and went to law
and made me his son, because he'd lost a boy about my age. And so that's how we have different
names, he telling me I'd ought to keep mine instead of taking his."

She was excited by the tale, which he had told almost in one breath, and now she was eager
to question, looking over to see if her father would not also be interested; but the latter
gave no sign.

"You poor little boy, among those wretched Indians! But why were your father and mother killed?
Did the Indians do it?"

"No, not Indians that did it--and I never did know why they killed them--they that did do it."

"But how queer! Don't you know who it was?"

Before answering, he paused to take one of the long revolvers from its holster, laying it across
his lap, his right hand still grasping it.

"It was tiring my leg where it was," he explained. "I'll just rest myself by holding it here.
I've practised a good smart bit with these pistols against the time when I'd meet some of them
that did it--that killed my father and mother and lots of others, and little children, too."

"How terrible! And it wasn't Indians?"

"No--I told you that already--it wasn't Indians."

"Don't you know who it was?"

"Oh, yes, I know all of them I want to know. The fact is, up there at Cedar City I met some
people that got confidential with me one day, and told me a lot of their names. There was Mr.
Barney Carter and Mr. Sam Woods, and they talked right freely about some folks. I found out
what I was wanting to know, being that they were drinking men."

He had moved slightly as he spoke and she glanced at the revolver still held along his knee.

"Isn't that dangerous--seems to me it's pointed almost toward father."

"Oh, not a bit dangerous, and it rests me to hold it there. You see it was hereabouts this
thing happened. In fact, I came down here looking for a big man, and a little girl that I remembered,
whose father and mother were killed at the same time mine was. This little girl was about three
or four, I reckon, and she was taken by one of the murderers. He seemed like an awful big man
to me. By the way, that's mean whiskey your Bishop sells on the sly up at Cedar City. Why,
it's worse than Taos lightning. Well, this Barney Carter and Mr. Sam Woods, they would drink
it all right, but they said one drink made a man ugly and two made him so downright bad that
he'd just as lief tear his wife's best bonnet to pieces as not. But they seemed to like me
pretty well, and they drank a lot of this whiskey that the Bishop sold me, and then they got
talking pretty freely about old times. I gathered that this man that took the little girl is
a pretty big man around here. Of course I wasn't expecting anything like that; I thought naturally
he'd be a low-down sort to have been mixed up in a thing like that."

He spoke his next words very slowly, with little pauses.

"But I found out what his name was--it was--"

He stopped, for there had been an indistinct sound from where her father sat, now in the gloom
of the evening. She called to him:

"Did you speak, father?"

There was no reply or movement from the figure in the chair, and Follett resumed:

"I guess he was just asleep and dreaming about something. Well, anyway--I--I found out afterwards
by telling it before him, that Mr. Barney Carter and his drunken friend had given me his name
right, though I could hardly believe it before."

"What an awful, awful thing! What wickedness there is in the world!"

"Oh, a tolerable lot," he assented.

He had been all animation and eagerness in the telling of the story, but had now become curiously
silent and listless; so that, although she was eager with many questions about what he had
said, she did not ask them, waiting to see if he would not talk again. But instead of talking,
he stayed silent and presently began to fidget in his chair. At last he said, "If you'll excuse
us, Miss Prudence, your pa and I have got a little business matter to talk over--to-night.
I guess we can go down here by the corral and do it."

But she arose quickly and bade him good night. "I hope I shall see you to-morrow," she said.

She bent over to kiss her father as she went in, and when she had done so, warned him that
he must not sit in the night air.

"Why your face is actually wet with a cold sweat. You ought to come in at once."

"After a very little, dear. Go to bed now--and always be a good girl!"

"And you've grown so hoarse sitting here."

"In a little while,--always be a good girl!"

She went in with a parting admonition: "Remember your cough--good night!"

When she had gone neither man stirred for the space of a minute. The little man, huddled in
his seat, had not changed his position; he still sat with his chair tilted back against the
house, his chin on his breast.

The other had remained standing where the girl left him, the revolver in his hand. After the
minute of silence he crossed over and stood in front of the seated man.

"Come," he said, gruffly, "where do you want to go?"

CHAPTER XXXIV.

How the Avenger Bungled His Vengeance

At last he stood up, slowly, unsteadily, grasping Follett by the arm for support. He spoke
almost in a whisper.

"Come back here first--to talk--then I'll go with you."

He entered the house, the young man following close, suspicious, narrowly watchful.

"No fooling now,--feel the end of that gun in your back?" The other made no reply. Inside the
door he took a candle from the box against the wall and lighted it.

"Don't think I'm trying anything--come here."

They went on, the little bent man ahead, holding the candle well up. His room was at the far
end of the long house. When they reached it, he closed the door and fixed the candle on the
table in some of its own grease. Then he pointed Follett to the one stool in the little cell-like
room, and threw himself face down on the bed.

Follett, still standing, waited for him to speak. After a moment's silence he grew impatient.

"Come, come! What would you be saying if you were talking? I can't wait here all night."

But the little man on the bed was still silent, nor did he stir, and after another wait Follett
broke out again.

"If you want to talk, talk, I tell you. If you don't want to, I can say all I have to say, quick."

Then the other turned himself over on the bed and half sat up, leaning on his elbow.

"I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but you see I'm so weak"--the strained little smile came to
his face--"and tremble so, there's so much to think of--do you hear those women scream--there!
did you hear that?--but of course not. Now--wait just a moment--have you come to kill me?"

"You and those two other hellions--the two that took me and that boy out that night to bury us."

"Did you think of the consequences?"

"I reckoned you'd be called paid for, any time any one come gunning for you. I didn't think
there'd be any consequences."

"Hereafter, I mean; to your soul. What a pity you didn't wait a little longer! Those other
two are already punished."

"Don't lie to me now?"

The little smile lighted his face again.

"I have a load of sin on me--but I don't think I ever did lie to any one--I guess I never was
tempted--"

"Oh, you've acted lies enough."

"You're right--that's so. But I'm telling you truth now--those two men had both been in the
Meadows that day and it killed them. One went crazy and ran off into the desert. They found
his bones. The other shot himself a few years ago. Those of us that live are already in hell--"

He sat up, now, animated for the moment.

"--in hell right here, I tell you. I'd have welcomed you, or any other man that would kill
me, any time this fifteen years. I'd have gone out to meet you. Do you think I like to hear
the women scream? Do you think I'm not crazed myself by this thing--right back of me here,
now--crawling, bleeding, breathing on me--trying to come here in front where I must see it?
Don't you see God has known how to punish me worse than you could, just by keeping me alive
and sane? Oh, man! you don't know how I've longed for that bullet of yours, right here through
the temples where the cries sound worst. I didn't dare to do it myself--I was afraid I'd make
my punishment worse if I tried to shirk; but I used to hope you would come as you said you
would. I wonder I didn't know you at once."

He put his hands to his head and fell back again on the pillow, with a little moan.

"Well, it ain't strange I didn't know you. I was looking for a big man. You seemed as big as
a house to me that day. I forgot that I'd grown up and you might be small. When those fellows
got tight up there and let on like it was you that some folks hinted had took a child and kept
it out of that muss, I couldn't hardly believe it; and everybody seeming to regard you so highly.
And I couldn't believe this big girl was little Prue Girnway that I remembered. It seemed like
you two would have to be a great big man and a little bit of a baby girl with yellow hair;
and now I find you're--say, Mister, honestly, you're such a poor, broke-down, little coot it
seems a'most like a shame to put a bullet through you, in spite of all your doings!"

The little man sat up again, with new animation in his eyes,--the same eager boyishness that
he had somehow kept through all his years.

"Don't!" he exclaimed, earnestly. "Let me beg you, don't kill me! For your own sake--not for
mine. I'm a poor, meatless husk. I'll die soon at best, and I'm already in a hell you can't
make any hotter. Let me do you this service; let me persuade you not to kill me. Have you ever
killed a man?"

"No, not yet; I've allowed to a couple of times, but it's never come just that way."

"You ought to thank God. Don't ever. You'll be in hell as sure as you do,--a hell right here
that you must carry inside of you forever--that even God can't take out of you. Listen--it's
a great secret, worth millions. If you're so bad you can't forgive yourself, you have to suffer
hell-fire no matter how much the Lord forgives you. It sounds queer, but there's the limit
to His power. He's made us so nearly in His image that we have to win our own forgiveness;
why, you can see yourself, it had to be that way; there would have been no dignity to a soul
that could swallow all its own wickedness so long as the Lord could. God has given us to know
good and evil for ourselves--and we have to take the consequences. Look at me. I suffer day
and night, and always must. God has forgiven me, but I can't forgive myself, for my own sin
and my people's sin,--for my preaching was one of the things that led them into that meadow.
I know that Christ died for us, but that can't put out this fire that I have to build in my
own soul. I tell you a man is like an angel, he can be good or bad; he has a power for heaven
but the same power for hell--"

"See here, I don't know anything about all this hell-talk, but I do know--"

"I tell you death is the very last thing I have left to look forward to, but if you kill me
it will be your own undoing. You will never get me out of your eyes or your ears, poor wreck
as I am--so feeble. You can see what my punishment has been. A little while ago I was young,
and strong, and proud like you, fearing nothing and wanting everything, but something was wrong.
I was climbing up as I thought, and then all at once I saw I had been climbing down--down into
a pit I never could get out of. You will be there if you kill me." He sank back on the bed again.

Follett slowly put the revolver into its holster and sat down on the low stool.

"I don't know anything about all this hell-talk, but I see I can't kill you--you're such a
poor, miserable cuss. And I thought you were a big strong man, handy with a gun and all that,
and like as not I'd have to make a quick draw on you when the time come. And now look at you!
Why, Mister, I'm doggoned if I ain't almost sorry for you! You sure have been getting your
deservance good and plenty. Say, what in God's name did you all do such a hellish thing for,
anyway?"

"We had been persecuted, hunted, and driven, our Prophet murdered, our women and children butchered,
and another army was on the way."

"Well, that was because you were such an ornery lot, always setting yourself up against the
government wherever you went, and acting scandalous--"

"We did as the Lord directed us--"

"Oh, shucks!"

"And then we thought the time had come to stand up for our rights; that the Lord meant us to
be free and independent."

"Secesh, eh?" Follett was amused. "You handful of Mormons--Uncle Sam could have licked you
with both hands tied behind him. Why, you crazy fool, he'd have spit on you and drowned every
last one of you, old Brigham Young and all. Fighting the United States! A few dozen women-butchers
going to do what the whole South couldn't! Well, I am danged."

He mused over it, and for awhile neither spoke.

"And the nearest you ever got to it was cutting up a lot of women and children after you'd
cheated the men into giving up their guns!"

The other groaned.

"There now, that's right--don't you see that hurts worse than killing?"

"But I certainly wish I could have got those other two that took us off into the sage-brush
that night. I didn't guess what for, but the first thing I knew the other boy was scratching,
and kicking, and hollering, and like to have wriggled away, so the cuss that was with me ran
up to help. Then I heard little John making kind of a squeally noise in his throat like he
was being choked, and that was all I wanted. I legged it into the sage-brush. I heard them
swearing and coming after me, and ran harder, and, what saved me, I tripped and fell down and
hurt myself, so I lay still and they lost track of me. I was scared, I promise you that; but
after they got off a ways I worked in the other direction by spells till I got to a little
wady, and by sunup they weren't in sight any longer. When I saw the Indians coming along I
wasn't a bit scared. I knew they weren't Mormons."

"I used to pray that you might come back and kill me."

"I used to wish I would grow faster so I could. I was always laying out to do it."

"But see how I've been punished. Look at me--I'm fifty. I ought to be in my prime. See how
I've been burnt out."

"But look here, Mister, what about this girl? Do you think you've been doing right by keeping
her here?"

"No, no! it was a wrong as great as the other."

"Why, they're even passing remarks about her mother, those that don't know where you got her,--saying
it was some one you never married, because the book shows your first wife was this one-handed
woman here."

"I know, I know it. I meant to let her go back at first, but she took hold of me, and her father
and mother were both dead."

"She's got a grandfather and grandmother, alive and hearty, back at Springfield."

"She is all that has kept me alive these last years."

"She's got to go back to her people now. She'll want to bad enough when she knows about this."

"About this? Surely you won't tell her--"

"Look here now, why not? What do you expect?"

"But she loves me--she does--and she's all I've got. Man, man! don't pile it all on me just
at the last."

He was off the bed and on his knees before Follett.

"Don't put it all on me. I've rounded up my back to the rest of it, but keep this off; please,
please don't. Let her always think I'm not bad. Give me that one thing out of all the world."

He tried to reach the young man's hand, but was pushed roughly away.

"Don't do that--get up--stop, I tell you. That ain't any way to do. There now! Lie down again.
What do you want? I'm not going to leave that ain't any way to do. There now! Lie down again.
What do you want? I'm not going to leave that girl with you nor with your infernal Church.
You understand that."

"Yes, yes, I know it. It was right that you should be the one to come and take her away. The
Lord's vengeance was well thought out. Oh, how much more he can make us suffer than you could
with your clumsy killings! She must go, but wait--not yet--not yet. Oh, my God! I couldn't
stand it to see her go. It would cut into my heart and leave me to bleed to death. No, no,
no--don't! Please don't! Don't pile it all on me at the last. The end has come anyway. Don't
do that--don't, don't!"

"There, there, be still now." There was a rough sort of soothing in Follett's voice, and they
were both silent a moment. Then the young man went on:

"But what do you expect? Suppose everything was left to you, Mister. Come now, you're trying
to talk fair. Suppose I leave it to you--only you know you can't keep her."

"Yes, it can't be, but let her stay a little while; let me see her a few times more; let me
know she doesn't think I'm bad; and promise never to tell her all of it. Let her always think
I was a good man. Do promise me that. I'd do it for you, Follett. It won't hurt you. Let her
think I was a good man."

"How long do you want her to stay here?--a week, ten days?"

"It will kill me when she goes!"

"Oh, well, two weeks?"

"That's good of you; you're kinder at your age than I was--I shall die when she goes."

"Well, I wouldn't want to live if I were you."

"Just a little longer, knowing that she cares for me. I've never been free to have the love
of a woman the way you will some day, though I've hungered and sickened for it--for a woman
who would understand and be close. But this girl has been the soul of it some way. See here,
Follett, let her stay this summer, or until I'm dead. That can't be a long time. I've felt
the end coming for a year now. Let her stay, believing in me. Let me know to the last that
I'm the only man who has been in her heart, who has won her confidence and her love. Oh, I
mean fair. You stay with us yourself and watch. Come--but look there, look, man!"

"Well,--what?"

"That candle is going out,--we'll be in the dark"--he grasped the other's arm--"in the dark,
and now I'm afraid again. Don't leave me here! It would be an awful death to die. Here's that
thing now on the bed behind me. It's trying to get around in front where I'll have to see it--get
another candle. No--don't leave me,--this one will go out while you're gone." All his strength
went into the grip on Follett's arm. The candle was sputtering in its pool of grease.

"There, it's gone--now don't, don't leave me. It's trying to crawl over me--I smell the blood--"

"Well--lie down there--it serves you right. There--stop it--I'll stay with you."

Until dawn Follett sat by the bunk, submitting his arm to the other's frenzied grip. From time
to time he somewhat awkwardly uttered little words that were meant to be soothing, as he would
have done to a frightened child.

When morning brought the gray light into the little room, the haunted man fell into a doze,
and Follett, gently unclasping the hands from his arm, arose and went softly out. He was cramped
from sitting still so long, and chilled, and his arm hurt where the other had gripped it. He
pulled back the blue woollen sleeve and saw above his wrist livid marks where the nails had
sunk into his flesh.

Then out of the room back of him came a sharp cry, as from one who had awakened from a dream
of terror. He stepped to the door again and looked in.

"There now--don't be scared any more. The daylight has come; it's all right--all right--go
to sleep now--"

He stood listening until the man he had come to kill was again quiet. Then he went outside
and over to the creek back of the willows to bathe in the fresh running water.

CHAPTER XXXV.

Ruel Follett's Way of Business

By the time the women were stirring that morning, Follett galloped up on his horse. Prudence
saw him from the doorway as he turned in from the main road, sitting his saddle with apparent
carelessness, his arms loose from the shoulders, shifting lightly with the horse's motion,
as one who had made the center of gravity his slave. It was a style of riding that would have
made a scandal in any riding-school; but it seemed to be well calculated for the quick halts,
sudden swerves, and acute angles affected by the yearling steer in his moments of excitement.

He dismounted, glowing from his bath in the icy water of the creek and from the headlong gallop
up from Beil Wardle's corral.

"Good morning, Miss Prudence."

"Good morning, Mr. Follett. Will you take breakfast with us directly?"

"Yes, and it can't be too directly for me. I'm wolfish. Miss Prudence, your pa and me had some
talk last night, and I'm going to bunk in with you all for awhile, till I get some business
fixed up."

She smiled with unaffected gladness, and he noticed that her fresh morning colour was like
that of the little wild roses he had lately brushed the dew from along the creek.

"We shall be glad to have you."

"It's right kind of you; I'm proud to hear you say so." He had taken off the saddle with its
gay coloured Navajo blanket, and the bridle of plaited rawhide with its conchos and its silver
bit. Now he rubbed the back of his horse where the saddle had been, ending with a slap that
sent the beast off with head down and glad heels in the air.

"There now, Dandy! don't bury your ribs too deep under that new grass."

"My father will be glad to have you and Dandy stay a long time."

He looked at her quickly, and then away before he spoke. It was a look that she thought seemed
to say more than the words that followed it.

"Well, the fact is, Miss Prudence, I don't just know how long I'll have to be in these parts.
I got some particular kind of business that's lasting longer than I thought it would. I reckon
it's one of those jobs where you have to let it work itself out while you sit still and watch.
Sometimes you get business on hand that seems to know more about itself than you do."

"That's funny."

"Yes, it's like when they first sent me out on the range. They were cutting out steers from
a big bunch, and they put me on a little blue roan to hold the cut. Well, cattle hate to leave
the bunch, so those they cut out would start to run back, and I had to head and turn them.
I did it so well I was surprised at myself. No sooner did a steer head back than I had the
spurs in and was after it, and I'd always get it stopped. I certainly did think I was doing
it high, wide, and handsome, like you might say; only once or twice I noticed that the pony
stopped short when the steer did without my pulling him up, as if he'd seen the stop before
I did. And then pretty soon after, a yearling that was just the--excuse me--that was awful
spry at dodging, led me a chase, the pony stopped stiff-legged when the steer did, and while
I was leaning one way he was off after the steer the other way so quick that I just naturally
slid off. I watched him head and turn that steer all by himself, and then I learned something.
It seemed like he went to sleep when I got on him. But after that I didn't pay any attention
to the cattle. I let him keep the whole lookout, and all I did was to set in the saddle. He
was a wise old cow-pony. He taught me a lot about chasing steers. He was always after one the
minute it left the cut, and he'd know just the second it was going to stop and turn; he'd never
go a foot farther than the steer did, and he'd turn back just as quick. I knew he knew I was
green, but I thought the other men didn't, so I just set quiet and played off like I was doing
it all, when I wasn't really doing a thing but holding on. He was old, and they didn't use
him much except when they wanted a rope-horse around the corral. And he'd made a lifelong study
of steers. He knew them from horns to tail, and by saying nothing and looking wise I thought
I'd get the credit of being smart myself. It's kind of that way now. I'm holding tight and
looking wise about some business that I ain't what you could call up in."

He carried the saddle and bridle into the house, and she followed him. They found Lorena annoyed
by the indisposition of her husband.

"Dear me suz! Here's your pa bed-fast again. He's had a bad night and won't open the door to
let me tell him if he needs anything. He says he won't even take spoon victuals, and he won't
get up, and his chest don't hurt him so that ain't it, and I never was any hand to be nattering
around a body, but he hadn't ought to go without his food like he does, when the Father himself
has a tabernacle of flesh like you or me--though the Holy Ghost has not--and it's probably
mountain fever again, so I'll make some composition tea and he's just got to take it. Of course
I never had no revelations from the Lord and never did I claim to have, but you don't need
the Holy Ghost coming upon you to tell you the plain doings of common sense."

Whatever the nature of Mr. Follett's business, his confidence in the soundness of his attitude
toward it was perfect. He showed no sign of abstraction or anxiety; no sign of aught but a
desire to live agreeably in the present,--a present that included Prudence. When the early
breakfast was over they went out about the place, through the peach-orchard and the vineyard
still dewy, lingering in the shade of a plum-tree, finding all matters to be of interest. For
a time they watched and laughed at the two calves through the bars of the corral, cavorting
feebly on stiffened legs while the bereaved mothers cast languishing glances at them from outside,
conscious that their milk was being basely diverted from the rightful heirs. They picked many
blossoms and talked of many things. There was no idle moment from early morning until high
noon; and yet, though they were very busy, they achieved absolutely nothing.

In the afternoon Prudence donned her own sombrero, and they went to the cañon to fish. From
a clump of the yellowish green willows that fringed the stream, Follett cut a slender wand.
To this he fixed a line and a tiny hook that he had carried in his hat, and for the rest of
the distance to the cañon's mouth he collected such grasshoppers as lingered too long in his
shadow. Entering the cañon, they followed up the stream, clambering over broken rocks, skirting
huge boulders, and turning aside to go around a gorge that narrowed the torrent and flung it
down in a little cascade.

Here and there Follett would flicker his hook over the surface of a shaded pool, poise it at
the foot of a ripple, skim it across an eddy, cast it under a shelf of rock or dangle it in
some promising nook by the willow roots, shielding himself meanwhile as best he could; here
behind a boulder, there bending a willow in front of him, again lying flat on the bank, taking
care to keep even his shadow off the stream and to go silently.

From where she followed, Prudence would see the surface of the water break with a curling gleam
of gold, which would give way to a bubbling splash; then she would see the willow rod bend,
see it vibrate and thrill and tremble, the point working slowly over the bank. Then perhaps
the rod would suddenly straighten out for a few seconds only to bend again, slowly, gently,
but mercilessly. Or perhaps the point continued to come in until it was well over the bank
and the end of the line close by. Then after a frantic splashing on the margin of the stream
the conquered trout would be gasping on the bank, a thing of shivering gleams of blended brown
and gold and pink. At first she pitied the fish and regretted the cruelty of man, but Follett
had other views.

"Why," he said, "a trout is the crudest beast there is. Look at it trying to swallow this poor
little hopper that it thought tumbled into the water by accident. It just loves to eat its
stuff alive. And it isn't particular. It would just as lief eat its own children. Now you take
that one there, and say he was ten thousand times as big as he is, and you were coming along
here and your foot slipped and Mr. Trout was lying behind this rock here--hungry. Say! What
a mouthful you'd make, pink dress and all--he'd have you swallowed in a second, and then he'd
sneak back behind the rock there, wiping his mouth, and hoping your little sister or somebody
would be along in a minute and fall in too."

"Ugh!--Why, what horrible little monsters! Let me catch one."

And so she fished under his direction. They lurked together in the shadows of rocks, while
he showed her how to flicker the bait in the current, here holding her hand on the rod, again
supporting her while she leaned out to cast around a boulder, each feeling the other's breathless
caution and looking deep into each other's eyes through seconds of tense silence.

Such as they were, these were the only results of the lesson; results that left them in easy
friendliness toward each other. For the fish were not deceived by her. He would point out some
pool where very probably a hungry trout was lying in wait with his head to the current, and
she would try to skim the lure over it. More than once she saw the fish dart toward it, but
never did she quite convince them. Oftener she saw them flit up-stream in fright, like flashes
of gray lightning. Yet at length she felt she had learned all that could be taught of the art,
and that further failure would mean merely a lack of appetite or spirit in the fish. So she
went on alone, while Follett stopped to clean the dozen trout he had caught.

While she was in sight he watched her, the figure bending lithe as the rod she held, moving
lightly, now a long, now a short step, half kneeling to throw the bait into an eddy; then off
again with determined strides to the next likely pool. When he could no longer see her, he
fell to work on his fish, scouring their slime off in the dry sand.

When she returned, she found him on his back, his hat off, his arms flung out above his head,
fast asleep. She sat near by on a smooth rock at the water's edge and waited--without impatience,
for this was the first time she had been free to look at him quite as she wished to. She studied
him closely now. He seemed to her like some young power of that far strange eastern land. She
thought of something she had heard him say about Dandy: "He's game and fearless and almighty
prompt,--but he's kind and gentle too." She was pleased to think it described the master as
well as the horse. And she was glad they had been such fine playmates the whole day long. When
the shadow moved off his face and left it in the slanting rays of the sun, she broke off a
spruce bough and propped it against the rock to shield him.

And then she sighed, for they could be playmates only in forgetfulness. He was a Gentile, and
by that token wicked and lost; unless--and in that moment she flushed, feeling the warmth of
a high purpose.

She would save him. He was worth saving, from his crown of yellow hair to the high heels of
his Mexican boots. Strong, clean, gentle, and--she hesitated for a word--interesting--he must
be brought into the Kingdom, and she would do it. She looked up again and met his wide-open eyes.

They both laughed. "I sat up with your pa last night," he said, ashamed of having slept. "We
had some business to palaver about."

He had tied the fish into a bundle with aspen leaves and damp moss around them, and now they
went back down the stream. In the flush of her new rôle as missionary she allowed herself to
feel a secret motherly tenderness for his immortal soul, letting him help her by hand or arm
over places where she knew she could have gone much better alone.

Back at the house they were met by the little bent man, who had tossed upon his bed all day
in the fires of his hell. He looked searchingly at them to be sure that Follett had kept his
secret. Then, relieved by the frank glance of Prudence, he fell to musing on the two, so young,
so fresh, so joyous in the world and in each other, seeing them side by side with those little
half-felt, timidly implied, or unconsciously expressed confidences of boy and girl; sensing
the memory of his own lost youth's aroma, his youth that had slipped off unrecked in the haze
of his dreams of glory. For this he felt very tenderly toward them, wishing that they were
brother and sister and his own.

That evening, while they sat out of doors, she said, very resolutely:

"I'm going to teach Mr. Follett some truth tomorrow from the Book of Mormon. He says he has
never been baptised in any church."

Follett looked interested and cordial, but her father failed to display the enthusiasm she
had expected, and seemed even a little embarrassed.

"You mean well, daughter, but don't be discouraged if he is slow to take our truth. Perhaps
he has a kind of his own as good as ours. A woman I knew once said to me,' Going to heaven
is like going to mill; if your wheat is good the miller will never ask how you came.'"

"But, Father, suppose you get to mill and have only chaff?"

"That is the same answer I made, dear. I wish I hadn't."

Later, when Prudence had gone, the two men made their beds by the fire in the big room. Follett
was awakened twice by the other putting wood on the fire; and twice more by his pitiful pleading
with something at his back not to come in front of him.

CHAPTER XXXVI.

The Mission to a Deserving Gentile

Not daunted by her father's strange lack of enthusiasm, Prudence arose with the thought of
her self-imposed mission strong upon her. Nor was she in any degree cooled from it by a sight
of the lost sheep striding up from the creek, the first level sunrays touching his tousled
yellow hair, his face glowing, breathing his full of the wine-like air, and joyously showing
in every move his faultless attunement with all outside himself. The frank simplicity of his
greeting, his careless unenlightenment of his own wretched spiritual state, thrilled her like
an electric shock with a strange new pity for him. She prayed on the spot for power to send
him into the waters of baptism. When the day had begun, she lost no time in opening up the
truth to him.

If the young man was at all amazed by the utter wholeness of her conviction that she was stooping
from an immense height to pluck him from the burning, he succeeded in hiding it. He assumed
with her at once that she was saved, that he was in the way of being lost, and that his behooving
was to listen to her meekly. Her very evident alarm for his lost condition, her earnest desire
to save him, were what he felt moved to dwell upon, rather than a certain spiritual condescension
which he could not wholly ignore.

After some general counsel, in the morning, she took out her old, dog-eared "Book of Mormon,"
a first edition, printed at Palmyra, New York, in 1830, "By Joseph Smith, Jr., Author and Proprietor,"
and led the not unworthy Gentile again to the cañon. There in her favourite nook of pines beside
the stream, she would share with him as much of the Lord's truth as his darkened mind could
be made conscious of.

When at last she was seated on the brown carpet under the pines, her back to a mighty boulder,
the sacred record in her lap, and the Gentile prone at her feet, she found it no easy task
to begin. First he must be brought to repent of his sins. She began to wonder what his sins
could be, and from that drifted into an idle survey of his profile, the line of his throat
as his head lay back on the ground, and the strong brown hand, veined and corded, that curled
in repose on his breast. She checked herself in this; for it could be profitable neither to
her soul nor to his.

"I'll teach you about the Book of Mormon first," she ventured.

"I'd like to hear it," said Follett, cheerfully.

"Of course you don't know anything about it."

"It isn't my fault, though. I've been unfortunate in my bringing up, that's all." He turned
on his side and leaned upon his elbow so he could look at her.

"You see, I've been brought up to believe that Mormons were about as bad as Mexicans. And Mexicans
are so mean that even coyotes won't touch them. Down at the big bend on the Santa Fé Trail
they shot a Mexican, old Jesus Bavispee, for running off cattle. He was pretty well dried out
to begin with, but the coyotes wouldn't have a thing to do with him, and so he just dried up
into a mummy. They propped him up by the ford there, and when the cowboys went by they would
roll a cigarette and light it and fix it in his mouth. Then they'd pat him on the head and
tell him what a good old boy he was--star bueno--the only good Mexican above ground--and his
face would be grinning all the time, as if it tickled him. When they find a Mexican rustling
cattle they always leave him there, and they used to tell me that the Mormons were just as
bad and ought to be fixed that way too."

"I think that was horrible!"

"Of course it was. They were bigoted. But I'm not. I know right well there must be good Mexicans
alive, though I never saw one, and I suppose of course there must be--"

"Oh, you're worse than I thought!" she cried. "Come now, do try. I want you to be made better,
for my sake." She looked at him with real pleading in her eyes. He dropped back to the ground
with a thrill of searching religious fervour.

"Go on," he said, feelingly. "I'm ready for anything. I have kind of a good feeling running
through me already. I do believe you'll be a powerful lot of benefit to me."

"You must have faith," she answered, intent on the book. "Now I'll tell you some things first."

Had the Gentile been attentive he might have learned that the Book of Mormon is an inspired
record of equal authority with the Jewish Scriptures, containing the revelations of Jehovah
to his Israel of the western world as the Bible his revelations to Israel in the Orient,--the
veritable "stick of Joseph," that was to be one with "the stick of Judah;" that the angel Moroni,
a messenger from the presence of God, appeared to Joseph Smith, clad in robes of light, and
told him where were hid the plates of gold on which were graven this fulness of the everlasting
gospel; how that Joseph, after a few years of preparation, was let to take these sacred plates
from the hill of Cumorah; also an instrument called the Urim and Thummim, consisting of two
stones set in a silver bow and made fast to a breast-plate, this having been prepared by the
hands of God for use in translating the record on the plates; how Joseph, seated behind a curtain
and looking through the Urim and Thummim at the characters on the plates, had seen their English
equivalents over them, and dictated these to his amanuensis on the other side of the curtain.

He might have learned that when the book was thus translated, the angel Moroni had reclaimed
the golden plates and the Urim and Thummim, leaving the sacred deposit of doctrine to be given
to the world by Joseph Smith; that the Saviour had subsequently appeared to Joseph; also Peter,
James, and John, who laid hands upon him, ordained him, gave him the Holy Ghost, authorised
him to baptise for the remission of sins, and to organise the Kingdom of God on earth.

"Do you understand so far?" she asked.

"It's fine!" he answered, fervently. "I feel kind of a glow coming over me already."

She looked at him closely, with a quick suspicion, but found his profile uninforming; at least
of anything needful at the moment.

"Remember you must have faith," she admonished him, "if you are to win your inheritance; and
not question or doubt or find fault, or--or make fun of anything. It says right here on the
title-page, 'And now if there be faults, it be the mistake of men; wherefore condemn not the
things of God that ye may be found spotless at the judgment seat of Christ.' There now, remember!"

"Who's finding fault or making fun?" he asked, in tones that seemed to be pained.

"Now I think I'd better read you some verses. I don't know just where to begin."

"Something about that Urim and Thingamajig," he suggested.

"Urim and Thummim," she corrected--"now listen."

Again, had the Gentile remained attentive, he might have learned how the Western Hemisphere
was first peopled by the family of one Jared, who, after the confusion of tongues at Babel,
set out for the new land; how they grew and multiplied, but waxed sinful, and finally exterminated
one another in fierce battles, in one of which two million men were slain.

At this the fallen one sat up.

"'And it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were Coriantumr and
Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with loss of blood. And it came to pass when Coriantumr had leaned
upon his sword and rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz. And it came to pass, after
he had smote off the head of Shiz, that Shiz raised up on his hands and fell; and after he
had struggled for breath he died.'"

The Gentile was animated now.

"Say, that Shiz was all right,--raised up on his hands and struggled for breath after his head
was cut off!"

Hereupon she perceived that his interest was become purely carnal. So she refused to read of
any more battles, though he urged her warmly to do it. She returned to the expedition of Jared,
while the lost sheep fell resignedly on his back again.

"'And the Lord said, Go to work and build after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto
built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren,
and built barges after the manner which they had built, after the instructions of the Lord.
And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying--'"

She forgot him a little time, in the reading, until it occurred to her that he was singularly
quiet. She glanced up, and was horrified to see that he slept. The trials of Jared's brother
in building the boats that were about the length of a tree, combined with his broken rest of
the night before, had lured him into the dark valley of slumber where his soul could not lave
in the waters of truth. But something in the sleeping face softened her, and she smiled, waiting
for him to awaken. He was still only a waymark to the kingdom of folly, but she had made a
beginning, and she would persevere. He must be saved into the household of faith. And indeed
it was shameful that such as he should depend for their salvation upon a chance meeting with
an unskilled girl like herself. She wondered somewhat indignantly how any able-bodied Saint
could rest in the valley while this man's like were dying in sin for want of the word. As her
eye swept the sleeping figure, she was even conscious of a little wicked resentment against
the great plan itself, which could under any circumstances decree such as he to perdition.

He opened his eyes after awhile to ask her why she had stopped reading, and when she told him,
he declared brazenly that he had merely closed his eyes to shut out everything but her words.

"I heard everything," he insisted, again raised upon his elbows. "' It was built like unto
a dish, and the length was about as long as a tree--'"

"What was?"

"The Urim and Thummim."

When he saw that she was really distressed, he tried to cheer her.

"Now don't be discouraged," he said, as they started home in the late afternoon. "You can't
expect to get me roped and hog-tied the very first day. There's lots of time, and you'll have
to keep at it. When I was a kid learning to throw a rope, I used to practise on the skull of
a steer that was nailed to a post. At first it didn't look like I could ever do it. I'd forget
to let the rope loose from my left hand, or I wouldn't make the loop line out flat around my
head, or she'd switch off to one side, or something. But at last I'd get over the horns every
time. Then I learned to do it running past the post; and after that I'd go down around the
corral and practise on some quiet old heifer, and so on. The only thing is--never give up."

"But what good does it do if you won't pay attention?"

"Oh, well, I can't learn a new religion all at once. It's like riding a new saddle. You put
one on and 'drag the cinches up and lash them, and you think it's going to be fine, and you
don't see why it isn't. But you find out that you have to ride it a little at a time and break
it in. Now, you take a fresh start with me to-morrow."

"Of course I'm going to try."

"And it isn't as if I was regular out-and-out sinful. My adopted father, Ezra Calkins, he's
a good man. But, now I think of it, I don't know what church he ever did belong to. He'll go
to any of 'em,--don't make any difference which,--Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Catholic; he
says he can get all he's looking for out of any of 'em, and he kind of likes to change off
now and then. But he's a good man. He won't hire any one that cusses too bad or is hard on
animals, and he won't even let the freighters work on Sunday. He brought me up not to drink
or gamble, or go round with low folks and all like that, and not to swear except when you're
driving cattle and have to. 'Keep clean inside and out,' he says, 'and then you're safe,' he
says. 'Then tie up to some good church for company, if you want to, not thinking bad of the
others, just because you didn't happen to join them. Or it don't hurt any to graze a little
on all the ranges,' he says. And he sent me to public school and brought me up pretty well,
so you can see I'm not plumb wicked. Now after you get me coming, I may be easier than you think."

She resolved to pray for some special gift to meet his needs. If he were not really sinful,
there was all the more reason why he should be saved into the Kingdom. The sun went below the
western rim of the valley as they walked, and the cooling air was full of the fresh summer
scents from field and garden and orchard.

Down the road behind them, a half-hour later, swung the tall, loose-jointed figure of Seth
Wright, his homespun coat across his arm, his bearskin cap in his hand, his heated brow raised
to the cooling breeze. His ruffle of neck whiskers, virtuously white, looked in the dying sunlight
quite as if a halo he had worn was dropped under his chin. A little past the Rae place he met
Joel returning from the village.

"Evening, Brother Rae! You ain't looking right tol'lable."

"It's true, Brother Seth. I've thought lately that I'm standing in the end of my days."

"Peart up, peart up, man! Look at me,--sixty-eight years come December, never an ache nor a
pain, and got all my own teeth. Take another wife. That keeps a man young if he's got jedgment."
He glanced back toward the Rae house.

"And I want to speak to you special about something--this young dandy Gentile you're harbouring.
Course it's none of my business, but I wouldn't want one of my girls companying with a Gentile--off
up in that cañon with him, at that--fishing one day, reading a book the next, walking clost
together,--and specially not when Brigham had spoke for her. Oh, I know what I'm talking about!
I had my mallet and frow up there two days now, just beyond the lower dry-fork, splitting out
shakes for my new addition, and I seen 'em with my own eyes. You know what young folks is,
Elder. That reminds me--I'm going to seal up that sandy-haired daughter of Bishop Tanner's
next week some time; soon as we get the roof on the new part. But I thought I'd speak to you
about this--a word to the wise!"

The Wild Ram of the Mountains passed on, whistling a lively air. The little bent man went with
slow, troubled steps to his own home. He did know the way of young people, and he felt that
he was beginning to know the way of God. Each day one wall or another of his prison house moved
a little in upon him. In the end it would crush. He had given up everything but Prudence; and
now, for his wicked clinging to her, she was to be taken from him; if not by Brigham, then
by this Gentile, who would of course love her, and who, if he could not make her love him,
would be tempted to alienate her by exposing the crime of the man she believed to be her father.
The walls were closing about him. When he reached the house, they were sitting on the bench
outside.

"Sometimes," Follett was saying, "you can't tell at first whether a thing is right or wrong.
You have to take a long squint, like when you're in the woods on a path that ain't been used
much lately and has got blind. Put your face right close down to it and you can't see a sign
of a trail; it's the same as the ground both sides, covered with leaves the same way and not
a footprint or anything. But you stand up and look along it for fifty feet, and there she is
so plain you couldn't miss it. Isn't that so, Mr. Rae?"

Prudence went in, and her father beckoned him a little way from the door.

"You're sure you will never tell her anything about--anything, until I'm gone?--You promised
me, you know."

"Well, didn't I promise you?"

"Not under any circumstances?"

"You don't keep back anything about 'circumstances' when you make a promise," retorted Mr. Follett.

CHAPTER XXXVII.

The Gentile Issues an Ultimatum

June went; July came and went. It was a hot summer below, where the valley widens to let in
Amalon; but up in the little-sunned aisle of Box Cañon it was always cool. There the pines
are straight and reach their heads far into the sky, each a many-wired harp to the winds that
come down from the high divide. Their music is never still; now a low, ominous rush, soft but
mighty, swelling as it nears, the rush of a winged host, rising swiftly to one fearsome crescendo
until the listener cowers instinctively as if under the tread of many feet; then dying away
to mutter threats in the distance, and to come again more fiercely; or, it may be, to come
with a gentler sweep, as if pacified, even yearning, for the moment. Or, again, the same wind
will play quieter airs through the green boughs, a chamber-music of silken rustlings, of feathered
fans just stirring, of whisperings, and the sighs of a woman.

It is cool beneath these pines, and pleasant on the couches of brown needles that have fallen
through all the years. Here, in the softened light, amid the resinous pungence of the cones
and the green boughs, where the wind above played an endless, solemn accompaniment to the careless
song of the stream below, the maiden Saint tried to save into the Kingdom a youthful Gentile
of whom she discovered almost daily some fresh reason why he should not be lost. The reasons
had become so many that they were now heavy upon her. And yet, while the youth submitted meekly
to her ministry, appearing even to crave it, he was undeniably either dense or stubborn--in
either case of defective spirituality.

She was grieved by the number of times he fell asleep when she read from the Book of Mormon.
The times were many because, though she knew it not, he had come to be, in effect, a night-nurse
to the little bent man below, who was now living out his days in quiet desperation, and his
nights in a fear of something behind him. Some nights Follett would have unbroken rest; but
oftener he was awakened by the other's grip on his arm. Then he would get up, put fresh logs
on the fire or light a candle and talk with the haunted man until he became quiet again.

After a night like this it was not improbable that he would fall asleep in very sound of the
trumpet of truth as blown, by the grace of God, through the seership of Joseph Smith. Still
he had learned much in the course of the two months. She had taught him between naps that,
for fourteen hundred years, to the time of Joseph Smith, there had been a general and awful
apostasy from the true faith, so that the world had been without an authorised priesthood.
She had also taught him to be ill at ease away from her,--to be content when with her, whether
they talked of religion or tried for the big, sulky three-pounder that had his lair at the
foot of the upper Cascade.

Again she had taught him that other churches had wickedly done away with immersion for the
remission of sins and the laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost; also that there
was a peculiar quality in the satisfaction of being near her that he had never known before,--an
astonishing truth that it was fine to think about when he lay where he could look up at her
pretty, serious face.

He fell asleep at night usually with a mind full of confusion,--infant baptism--a slender figure
in a pink dress or a blue--the Trinity--a firm little brown hand pointing the finger of admonition
at him--the regeneration of man--hair, dark and lustrous, that fell often half away from what
he called its "lashings"--eternal punishment--earnest eyes--the Urim and Thummim,--and a pleading,
earnest voice.

He knew a few things definitely: that Moroni, last of the Nephites, had hidden up unto the
Lord the golden plates in the hill of Cumorah; and that the girl who taught him was in some
mysterious way the embodiment of all the wonderful things he had ever thought he wanted, of
all the strange beauties he had crudely pictured in lonely days along the trail. Here was something
he had supposed could come true only in a different world, the kind of world there was in the
first book he had ever read, where there had seemed to be no one but good fairies and children
that were uncommonly deserving. Yet he had never been able to get clearly into his mind the
nature and precise office of the Holy Ghost; nor had he ever become certain how he could bring
this wonderful young woman in closer relationship with himself. He felt that to put out his
hand toward her--except at certain great moments when he could help her over rough places and
feel her golden weight upon his arm--would be to startle her, and then all at once he would
awaken from a dream to find her gone. He thought he would feel very badly then, for probably
he would never be able to get back into the same dream again. So he was cautious, resolving
to make the thing last until it came true of itself.

Once when they followed the stream down, in the late afternoon, he had mused himself so full
of the wonder of her that he almost forgot his caution in an amiable impulse to let her share
in his feelings.

"You know," he began, "you're like as if I had been trying to think of a word I wanted to say--some
fine, big word, a fancy one--but I couldn't think of it. You know how you can't think of the
one you want sometimes, only nothing else will do in place of it, and then all at once, when
you quit trying to think, it flashes over you. You're like that. I never could think of you,
but I just had to because I couldn't get along without it, and then when I didn't expect it
you just happened along--the word came along and said itself."

Without speaking she had run ahead to pick the white and blue columbines and pink roses. And
he, alarmed at his boldness, fearing she would now be afraid of him, went forward with the
deep purpose of showing her a light, careless mood, to convince her that he had meant nothing much.

To this end he told her lively anecdotes, chaste classics of the range calculated to amuse,
until they reached the very door of home:--About the British sailor who, having drifted up
the Sacramento valley, was lured to mount a cow-pony known to be hysterical; of how he had
declared when they picked him up a moment later, "If I'd been aware of the gale I'd have lashed
myself to the rigging." Then about the other trusting tenderfoot who was directed to insist
at the stable in Santa Fé that they give him a "bucking broncho;" who was promptly accommodated
and speedily unseated with much flourish, to the wicked glee of those who had deceived him;
and who, when he asked what the horse had done and was told that he had "bucked," had thereupon
declared gratefully, "Did he only buck? It's a God's mercy he didn't broncho too, or he'd have
killed me!"

From this he drifted into the anecdote of old Chief Chew-feather, who became drunk one day
and made a nuisance of himself in the streets of Atchison; how he had been driven out of town
by Marshal Ed Lanigan, who, mounting his pony, chased him a mile or so, meantime emptying both
his six-shooters at the fleeing brave by way of making the exact situation clear even to a
clouded mind; and how the alarmed and sobered chief had ridden his own pony to a shadow, never
drawing rein until he reached the encampment of his tribe at dusk, to report that "the whites
had broken out at Atchison."

He noticed, however, that she was affected to even greater constraint of manner by these sallies,
though he laughed heartily himself at each climax as he made it, determined to show her that
he had meant absolutely nothing the moment before. He succeeded so little, that he resolved
never again to be reckless, if she would only be her old self on the morrow. He would not even
tell her, as he had meant to, that looking into her eyes was like looking off under the spruces,
where it was dark and yet light.

The little bent man at the house would look at them with a sort of helplessness when they came
in, sometimes even forgetting the smile he was wont to wear to hide his hurts. He was impressed
anew each time he saw them with the punishing power of such vengeance as was left to the Lord.
He could see more than either of the pair before him. The little white-haired boy who had fought
him with tooth and nail so long ago, to be not taken from Prudence, had now come back with
the might of a man, even the might of a lover, to take her from him when she had become all
of his life. He could think of no sharper revenge upon himself or his people. For this cowboy
was the spirit incarnate of the oncoming East, thorned on by the Lord to avenge his Church's crime.

Day after day he would lie consuming the little substance left within him in an effort to save
himself; to keep by him the child who had become his miser's gold; to keep her respect above
all, to have her think him a good man. Yet never a way would open. Here was the boy with the
man's might, and they were already lovers, for he knew too well the meaning of all those signs
which they themselves but half understood. And he became more miserable day by day, for he
saw clearly it was only his selfishness that made him suffer. He had met so many tests, and
now he must fail at the last great sacrifice.

Then in the night would come the terrors of the dark, the curses and groans of that always-dying
thing behind him. And always now he would see the hand with the silver bracelet at the wrist,
flaunting in his face the shivering strands of gold with the crimson patch at the end. Yet
even this, because he could see it, was less fearful than the thing he could not see, the thing
that crawled or lurched relentlessly behind him, with the snoring sound in its throat, the
smell of warm blood and the horrible dripping of it, whose breath he could feel on his neck
and whose nerveless hands sometimes fumbled weakly at his shoulder, as it strove to come in
front of him.

He sat sleepless in his chair with candles burning for three nights when Follett, late in August,
went off to meet a messenger from one of his father's wagon-trains which, he said, was on its
way north. Fearful as was the meaning of his presence, he was inexpressibly glad when the Gentile
returned to save him from the terrors of the night.

And there was now a new goad of remorse. The evening before Follett's return he had found Prudence
in tears after a visit to the village. With a sudden great outrush of pity he had taken her
in his arms to comfort her, feeling the selfishness strangely washed from his love, as the
sobs convulsed her.

"Come, come, child--tell your father what it is," he had urged her, and when she became a little
quiet she had told him.

"Oh, Daddy dear--I've just heard such an awful thing, what they talk of me in Amalon, and of
you and my mother--shameful!"

He knew then what was coming; he had wondered indeed, that this talk should be so long in reaching
her; but he waited silently, soothing her.

"They say, whoever my mother was, you couldn't have married her--that Christina is your first
wife, and the temple records show it. And oh, Daddy, they say it means that I am a child of
sin--and shame--and it made me want to kill myself."

Another passion of tears and sobs had overwhelmed her and all but broken down the little man.
Yet he controlled himself and soothed her again to quietness.

"It is all wrong, child, all wrong. You are not a child of sin, but a child of love, as rightly
born as any in Amalon. Believe me, and pay no heed to that talk."

"They have been saying it for years, and I never knew."

"They say what is not true."

"You were married to my mother, then?"

He waited too long. She divined, clear though his answer was, that he had evaded, or was quibbling
in some way.

"You are the daughter of a truly married husband and wife, as truly married as were ever any pair."

And though she knew he had turned her question, she saw that he must have done it for some
great reason of his own, and, even in her grief, she would not pain him by asking another.
She could feel that he suffered as she did, and he seemed, moreover, to be pitifully and strangely
frightened.

When Follett came riding back that evening he saw that Prudence had been troubled. The candle-light
showed sadness in her dark eyes and in the weighted corners of her mouth. He was moved to take
her in his arms and soothe her as he had seen mothers do with sorry little children. But instead
of this he questioned her father sharply when their corn-husk mattresses had been put before
either side of the fireplace for the night. The little man told him frankly the cause of her
grief. There was something compelling in the other's way of asking questions. When the thing
had been made plain, Follett looked at him indignantly.

"Do you mean to say you let her go on thinking that about herself?"

"I told her that her father and mother had been rightly married."

"Didn't she think you were fooling her in some way?"

"I--I can't be sure--"

"She must have, or she wouldn't be so down in the mouth now. Why didn't you tell her the truth?"

"If only--if only she could go on thinking I am her father--only a little while--"

Follett spoke with the ring of a sudden resolution in his voice.

"Now I'll tell you one thing, Mister man, something has got to be done by some one. I can't
do it because I'm tied by a promise, and so I reckon you ought to!"

"Just a little time! Oh, if you only knew how the knives cut me on every side and the fires
burn all through me!"

"Well, think of the knives cutting that girl,--making her believe she has to be ashamed of
her mother. You go to sleep now, and try to lie quiet; there ain't anything here to hurt you.
But I'll tell you one thing,--you've got to toe the mark."

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

The Mission Service in Box Cañon is Suspended

Follett waited with a new eagerness next day for their walk to the cañon. But Prudence, looking
at him with eyes that sorrow was clouding, said that she could not go. He felt a sharp new
resentment against the man who was letting her suffer rather than betray himself, and he again
resolved that this man must be made to "toe the mark," to "take his needings;" and that, meantime,
the deceived girl must be effectually reassured. Something must be said to take away the hurt
that was tugging at the corners of her smile to draw them down. To this end he pleaded with
her not to deprive him of the day's lesson, especially as the time was now at hand when he
must leave. And so ably did he word his appeal to her sense of duty that at last she consented
to go.

Once in the cañon, however, where the pines had stored away the cool gloom of the night against
the day's heat, she was glad she had come. For, better than being alone with that strange,
new hurt, was it to have by her side this friendly young man, who somehow made her feel as
if it were right and safe to lean upon him,--despite his unregenerate condition. JOSEPH great.

 He might say, 'Well, now, I'll draw a line in this marrying
business. I'll never take more than two or three wives or maybe four.' He might even be so
taken up with one young lady that he'd say, 'I won't even marry a second wife--not for some
time yet, that is--not for two or three years, till she begins to get kind of houseworn,' But
then after he's taken his second, the others would come easy. Say he marries, first time, a
tall, slim, dark girl,"--he looked at her musingly while she gazed intently into the stream
in front of them.

"--and then say he meets a little chit of a thing, kind of heavy-set like, with this light
yellow hair and pretty light blue eyes, that he saw one Sunday at church--"

Her dark face was flushing now in pained wonder.

"--why then it's so easy to keep on and marry others, with the preachers all preaching it from
the pulpit."

"But you wouldn't have to."

"No, you wouldn't have to marry any one after the second--after this little blonde--but you'd
have to marry her because it says here that you 'shall abide the law or ye shall be damned,
saith the Lord God.'"

He pulled himself along the ground closer to her, and went on again in what seemed to be an
extremity of doubt.

"Now I don't want to be lost, and yet I don't want to have a whole lot of wives like Brigham
or that old coot we see so often on the road. So what am I going to do? I might think I'd get
along with three or four, but you never can tell what religion will do to a man when he really
gets it."

He reached for her small brown hand that still held the Book of Mormon open on her lap, and
took it in both his own. He went on, appealingly:

"Now you try to tell me right--like as if I was your own brother--tell me as a sister. Try
to put yourself in the place of the girl I'd marry first--no, don't; it seems more like your
sister if I hold it this way--and try to think how she'd feel when I brought home my second.
Would that be doing square by her? Wouldn't it sort of get her on the bark? But if I join your
Church and don't do that, I might as well be one of those low-down Freewill Baptists or Episcopals.
Come now, tell me true, letting on that you're my sister."

She had not looked at him since he began, nor did she now.

"Oh, I don't know--I don't know--it's all so mixed! I thought you could be saved without that."

"There's the word of God against me."

"I wouldn't want you to marry that way,--if I were your sister."

"That's right now, try to feel like a sister. You wouldn't want me to have as many wives as
those old codgers down there below, would you?"

"No--I'm sure you shouldn't have but one. Oh, you couldn't marry more than one, could you?"
She turned her eyes for the first time upon him, and he saw that some inward warmth seemed
to be melting them.

"Well, I'd hate to disappoint you if you were my sister, but there's the word of the Lord--"

"Oh, but could you anyway, even if you didn't have a sister, and there was no one but her to
think of?"

He appeared to debate with himself cautiously.

"Well, now, I must say your teaching has taken a powerful hold on me this summer--" he reached
under her arm and caught her other hand. "You've been like a sister to me and made me think
about these things pretty deep and serious. I don't know if I could get what you've taught
me out of my mind or not."

"But how could you ever marry another wife?"

"Well, a man don't like to think he's going to the bad place when he dies, all on account of
not marrying a few more times. It sort of takes the ambition all out of him."

"Oh, it couldn't be right!"

"Well now, I'll do as you say. Do I forget all these things you've been teaching me, and settle
down with one wife,--or do I come into the Kingdom and lash the cinches of my glory good and
plenty by marrying whenever I get time to build a new end on the house, like old man Wright does?"

She was silent.

"Like a sister would tell a brother," he urged, with a tighter pressure of her two hands. But
this seemed to recall another trouble to her mind.

"I--I'm not fit to be your sister--don't talk of it--you don't know--" Her voice broke, and
he had to release her hand. Whereupon he put his own back up against the pine-tree, reached
his arm about her, and had her head upon his shoulder.

"There, there now!"

"But you don't know."

"Well, I do know--so just you straighten out that face. I do know, I tell you. Now don't cry
and I'll fix it all right, I promise you."

"But you don't even know what the trouble is."

"I do--it's about your father and mother--when they were married."

"How did you know?"

"I can't tell you now, but I will soon. Look here, you can believe what I tell you, can't you?"

"Yes, I can do that."

"Well, then, you listen. Your father and mother were married in the right way, and there wasn't
a single bit of crookedness about it. I wouldn't tell you if I didn't know and couldn't prove
it to you in a little while. Say, there's one of our wagon-trains coming along here toward
Salt Lake next Monday. It's coming out of its way on purpose to pick me up. I'll promise to
have it proved to you by that time. Now, is that fair? Can you believe me?"

She looked up at him, her face bright again.

"Oh, I do believe you! You don't know how glad you make me. It was an awful thing--oh, you
are a dear"--and full upon his lips she kissed the astounded young man, holding him fast with
an arm about his neck. "You've made me all over new--I was feeling so wretched--and of course
I can't see how you know anything about it, but I know you are telling the truth." Again she
kissed him with the utmost cordiality. Then she stood up to arrange her hair, her face full
of the joy of this assurance. The young man saw that she had forgotten both him and his religious
perplexities, and he did not wish her to be entirely divested of concern for him at this moment.

"But how about me? Here I am, lost if I do and lost if I don't. You better sit down here again
and see if there isn't some way I can get that crown of glory."

She sat down by him, instantly sobered from her own joy, and calmly gave him a hand to hold.

"Well, I'll tell you," she said, frankly. "You wait awhile. Don't do anything right away. I'll
have to ask father." And then as he reached over to pick up the Book of Mormon,--"No, let's
not read any more to-day. Let's sit a little while and only think about things." She was so
free from embarrassment that he began to doubt if he had been so very deeply clever, after
all, in suggesting the relationship between them. But after she had mused awhile, she seemed
to perceive for the first time that he was very earnestly holding both of her hands. She blushed,
and suddenly withdrew them. Whereat he was more pleased than when she had passively let them
lie. He approached the matter of salvation for himself once more.

"Of course I can wait awhile for you to find out the rights of this thing, but I'm afraid I
can't be baptised even if you tell me to be--even if you want me to obey the Lord and marry
some pretty little light-complected, yellow-haired thing afterwards--after I'd married my first
wife. Fact is, I don't believe I could. Probably I'd care so much for the first one that I'd
have blinders on for all the other women in the world. She'd have me tied down with the red
ribbon in her hair"--he touched the red ribbon in her own, by way of illustration--"just like
I can tie the biggest steer you ever saw with that little silk rag of mine--hold him, two hind
legs and one fore, so he can't budge an inch. I'd just like to see some little, short, kind
of plump, pretty yellow-haired thing come between us."

For an instant, she looked such warm, almost indignant approval that he believed she was about
to express an opinion of her own in the matter, but she stayed silent, looking away instead
with a little movement of having swallowed something.

"And you, too, if you were my sister, do you think I'd want you married to a man who'd begin
to look around for some one else as soon as he got you? No, sir--you deserve some decent young
fellow who'd love you all to pieces day in and day out and never so much as look at this little
yellow-haired girl--even if she was almost as pretty as you."

But she was not to be led into rendering any hasty decision which might affect his eternal
salvation. Moreover, she was embarrassed and disturbed.

"We must go," she said, rising before he could help her. When they had picked their way down
to the mouth of the cañon, he walking behind her, she turned back and said, "Of course you
could marry that little yellow-haired girl with the blue eyes first, the one you're thinking
so much about--the little short, fat thing with a doll-baby face--"

But he only answered, "Oh, well, if you get me into your Church it wouldn't make a bit of difference
whether I took her first or second."

CHAPTER XXXIX.

A Revelation Concerning the True Order of Marriage

While matters of theology and consanguinity were being debated in Box Cañon, the little bent
man down in the first house to the left, in his struggle to free himself, was tightening the
meshes of his fate about him. In his harried mind he had formed one great resolution. He believed
that a revelation had come to him. It seemed to press upon him as the culmination of all the
days of his distress. He could see now that he had felt it years before, when he first met
the wife of Elder Tench, the gaunt, gray woman, toiling along the dusty road; and again when
he had found the imbecile boy turning upon his tormentors. A hundred times it had quickened
within him. And it had gained in force steadily, until to-day, when it was overwhelming him.
Now that his flesh was wasted, it seemed that his spirit could see far.

His great discovery was that the revelation upon celestial marriage given to Joseph Smith had
been "from beneath,"--a trick of Satan to corrupt them. Not only did it flatly contradict earlier
revelations, but the very Book of Mormon itself declared again and again that polygamy was
wickedness. Joseph had been duped by the powers of darkness, and all Israel had sinned in consequence.
Upon the golden plates delivered to him, concerning the divine source of which there could
be no doubt, this order of marriage had been repeatedly condemned and forbidden. But as to
the revelation which sanctioned it there could rightly be doubt; for had not Joseph himself
once warned them that "some revelations are from God, some from men, and some from the Devil."
Either the Book of Mormon was not inspired, or the revelation was not from God, since they
were fatally in opposition.

It came to him with the effect of a blinding light, yet seemed to endow him with a new vigour,
so that he felt strong and eager to be up, to spread his truth abroad. Some remnant of that
old fire of inspiration flamed up within him as he lay on the hard bed in his little room,
with the summer scents floating in and the out-of-doors sounds,--a woman's voice calling a
child afar off, the lowing of cattle, the rhythmic whetting of a scythe-blade, the echoing
strokes of an axe, the mellow fluting of a robin,--all coming to him a little muted, as if
he were no longer in the world.

He raised upon his elbow, glowing with the flush of old memories when his heart had been perfect
with the Lord; when he had wrought miracles in the face of the people; when he had besought
Heaven fearlessly for signs of its favour; when he had dreamed of being a pillar of fire to
his people in their march across the desert, and another Lion of the Lord to fight their just
battles. The little bent man of sorrows had again become the Lute of the Holy Ghost.

He knew it must be a true revelation. And, while he might not now have strength to preach it
as it should be preached, there were other mighty men to spread its tidings. Even his simple
announcement of it must work a revolution. Others would see it when he had once declared it.
Others would spread it with power until the Saints were again become a purified people. But
he would have been the prophet, seer, and revelator, to whom the truth was given, and so his
suffering would not have been in vain; perhaps that suffering had been ordained to the end
that his vision should be cleared for this truth.

He remembered the day was Saturday, and he began at once to word the phrases in which he would
tell his revelation on the morrow. He knew that this must be done tactfully, in spite of its
divine source. It would be a momentous thing to the people and to the priesthood. It was conceivable,
indeed, that members of the latter might dispute it and argue with him, or even denounce him
for a heretic. But only at first; the thing was too simply true to be long questioned. In any
event, his duty was plain; with righteousness as the girdle of his loins he must go forth on
the morrow and magnify his office in the sight of Heaven.

When the decision had been taken he lay in an ecstasy of anticipation, feeling new pulses in
all his frame and the blood warm in his face. It would mean a new dawn for Israel. There would,
however, be a vexing difficulty in the matter of the present wives of the Saints. The song
of Lorena came in to him now:--

  "I was riding out this morning
     With my cousin by my side;
   She was telling her intentions
     For to soon become a bride."

The accent fell upon the first and third syllables with an upward surge of melody that seemed
to make the house vibrate. He thought perhaps some of the Saints would find it well to put
away all but the one rightful wife, making due provision, of course, for their support. Lorena's
never-ending ballad came like the horns that blew before the walls of Jericho, bringing down
the ramparts of his old belief. Some of the Saints would doubtless put away the false wives
as a penance. He might even bring himself to do it, since, in the light of his wondrous new
revelation, it would be obeying the Lord's will.

When Prudence came softly in to him, like a cool little breath of fragrance from the cañon,
he smiled up to her with a fulness of delight she had never seen in his face before.

There was a new light in her own eyes, new decisions presaged, a new desire imperfectly suppressed.
He stroked her hand as she sat beside him on the bed, wondering if she had at last learned
her own secret. But she became grave, and was diverted from her own affairs when she observed
him more closely.

"Why, you're sick--you're burning up with fever! You must be covered up at once and have sage tea."

He laughed at her, a free, full laugh, such as she had never heard from him in all the years.

"It's no fever, child. It's new life come to me. I'm strong again. My face burns, but it must
be the fire of health. I have a work given to me--God has not wholly put me aside."

"But I believe you are sick. Your hands are so hot, and your eyes look so unnatural. You must
let me--"

"Now, now--haven't I learned to tell sickness from the glow of a holy purpose?"

"You're sure you are well?"

"Better than for fifteen years."

She let herself be convinced for the moment.

"Then please tell me something. Must a man who comes into our faith, if he is baptised rightly,
also marry more than one wife if he is to be saved? Can't he be sure of his glory with one
if he loves her--oh, very, very much?"

He was moved at first to answer her out of the fulness of his heart, telling her of the wonderful
new revelation. But there came the impulse to guard it jealously in his own breast a little
longer, to glory secretly in it; half-fearful, too, that some virtue would go out of it should
he impart it too soon to another.

"Why do you want to know?"

"Ruel Follett would join our Church if he didn't have to marry more than one wife. If he loved
some one very much, I'm afraid he would find it hard to marry another girl--oh, he simply couldn't--no
matter how pretty she was. He never could do it." Here she pulled one of the scarlet ribbons
from her broad hat. She gave a little exclamation of relief as if she had really meant to detach
it.

"Tell him to wait a little."

"That's what I did tell him, but it seems hardly right to let him join believing that is necessary.
I think some one ought to find out that one wife is all God wants a man ever to have, and to
tell Mr. Follett so very plainly. His mind is really open to truth, and you know he might do
something reckless--he shouldn't be made to wait too long."

"Tell him to wait till to-morrow. I shall speak of this in meeting then. It will be all right--all
right, dear. Everything will be all right!"

"Only I am sure you are sick in spite of what you say. I know how to prove it, too--can you eat?"

"I'm too busy thinking of great things to be hungry."

"There--you would be hungry if you were well."

"I can't tell you how well I am, and as for food--our Elder Brother has been feeding me all
day with the bread of truth. Such wonderful new things the Lord has shown me!"

"But you must not get up. Lie still and we will nurse you."

He refused the food she brought him, and refused Lorena's sage tea. He was not to be cajoled
into treating as sickness the first real happiness he had felt for years. He lay still until
his little room grew shadowy in the dusk, filled with a great reviving hope that the Lord had
raised a new prophet to lead Israel out of bondage.

As the night fell, however, the shadows of the room began to trouble him as of old, and he
found himself growing hotter and hotter until he burned and gasped and the room seemed about
to stifle him. He arose from the bed, wondering that his feet should be so heavy and clumsy,
and his knees so weak, when he felt otherwise so strong. His head, too, felt large, and there
rang in his ears a singing of incessant quick beats. He made his way to the door, where he
heard the voices of Prudence and Follett. It was good to feel the cool night air upon his hot
face, and he reassured Prudence, who chided him for leaving his bed.

"When you hear me discourse tomorrow you will see how wrong you were about my being sick,"
he said. But she saw that he supported himself carefully from the doorway along the wall to
the near-by chair, and that he sank into it with every sign of weakness. His eyes, however,
were aglow with his secret, and he sat nodding his head over it in a lively way. "Brigham was
right," he said, "when he declared that any of us might receive revelations from on high; even
the least of us--only we are apt to be deaf to the whispered words until the Lord has scourged
us. I have been deaf a long time, but my ears are at last unstopped--who is it coming, dear?"

A tall figure, vague in the dusk, was walking briskly up the path that led in from the road.
It proved to be the Wild Ram of the Mountains, freshened by the look of rectitude that the
razor gave to his face each Saturday night.

"Evening, Brother Rae--evening, you young folks. Thank you, I will take a chair. You feeling
a bit more able than usual, Brother Rae?"

"Much better, Brother Seth. I shall be at meeting tomorrow."

"Glad to hear it, that's right good--you ain't been out for so long. And we want to have a
rousing time, too."

"Only we're afraid he has a fever instead of being so well," said Prudence. "He hasn't eaten
a thing all day."

"Well, he never did overeat himself, that I knew of," said the Bishop. "Not eating ain't any
sign with him. Now it would be with me. I never believed in fasting the flesh. The Spirit of
the Lord ain't ever so close to me as after I've had a good meal of victuals,--meat and potatoes
and plenty of good sop and a couple of pieces of pie. Then I can unbutton my vest and jest
set and set and hear the promptings of the Lord God of Hosts. I know some men ain't that way,
but then's the time when I beautify my inheritance in Zion the purtiest. And I'm mighty glad
Brother Joel can turn out to-morrow. Of course you heard the news?"

"What news, Brother Seth?"

"Brother Brigham gets here at eleven o'clock from New Harmony."

"Brother Brigham coming?"

"We're getting the bowery ready down in the square tonight so's to have services out of doors."

"He's coming to-morrow?" The words came from both Prudence and her father.

"Of course he's coming. Ben Hadley brought word over. They'll have a turkey dinner at Beil
Wardle's house and then services at two."

The flushed little man with the revelation felt himself grow suddenly cold. He had thought
it would be easy to launch his new truth in Amalon and let the news be carried to Brigham.
To get up in the very presence of him, in the full gaze of those cold blue eyes, was another
matter.

"But it's early for him. He doesn't usually come until after Conference, after it's got cooler."

The Bishop took on the air of a man who does not care to tell quite all that he knows.

"Yes; I suspicion some one's been sending tales to him about a certain young woman's carryings
on down here."

He looked sharply at Prudence, who looked at the ground and felt grateful for the dusk. Follett
looked hard at them both and was plainly interested. The Bishop spoke again.

"I ain't got no license to say so, but having done that young woman proud by engaging himself
to marry her, he might 'a' got annoyed if any one had 'a' told him she was being waited on
by a handsome young Gentile, gallivantin' off to cañons day after day--holding hands, too,
more than once. Oh, I ain't saying anything. Young blood is young blood; mine ain't always
been old, and I never blamed the young, but, of course, the needs of the Kingdom is a different
matter. Well, I'll have to be getting along now. We're going to put up some of the people at
our house, and I've got to fix to bed mother down in the wagon-box again, I reckon. I'll say
you'll be with us to-morrow, then, Brother Joel?"

The little bent man's voice had lost much of its life.

"Yes, Brother Seth, if I'm able."

"Well, I hope you are." He arose and looked at the sky. "Looks as if we might have some falling
weather. They say it's been moisting quite a bit up Cedar way. Well,--good night, all!"

When he was gone the matter of his visit was not referred to. With some constraint they talked
a little while of other things. But as soon as the two men were alone for the night, Follett
turned to him, almost fiercely.

"Say, now, what did that old goat-whiskered loon mean by his hintings about Prudence?"

The little man was troubled.

"Well, the fact is, Brigham has meant to marry her."

"You don't mean you'd have let him? Say, I'd hate to feel sorry for holding off on you like
I have!"

"No, no, don't think that of me."

"Well, what were you going to do?"

"I hardly knew."

"You better find out."

"I know it--I did find out, to-day. I know, and it will be all right. Trust me. I lost my faith
for a moment just now when I heard Brother Brigham was coming to-morrow; but I see how it is,--the
Lord has wished to prove me. Now there is all the more reason why I should not flinch. You
will see that I shall make it all right to-morrow."

"Well, the time's about up. I've been here over two months now, just because you were so kind
of helpless. And one of our wagon-trains will be along here about next Monday. Say, she wouldn't
ever have married him, would she?"

"No, she refused at once; she refused to consider it at all."

He was burning again with his fever, and there was something in his eagerness that seemed to
overcome Follett's indignation.

"Well, let it go till to-morrow, then. And you try to get some rest now. That's what I'm going
to do."

But the little bent man, flushed though he was, felt cold from the night air, and, piling more
logs on the fire, he drew his chair close in front of it.

As often as Follett wakened through the night he saw him sitting there, sometimes reading what
looked like a little old Bible, sometimes speaking aloud as if seeking to memorise a passage.

He fell asleep again with a feeling of pity for the little man.

CHAPTER XL.

A Procession, a Pursuit, and a Capture

Follett awoke to find himself superfluous. The women were rushing excitedly through their housework
in order to be at hand when the procession of Brigham and his suite should march in. Of Joel
Rae he caught but a glimpse through the door of his little room, the face flushed that had
a long time been sallow and bloodless. When the door had closed he could hear the voice, now
strong again. He seemed to be, as during the night, rehearsing something he meant to say. And
later it was plain that he prayed, though he heard nothing more than the high pleading of the
voice.

Follett would not have minded these things, but Prudence was gone and no one could tell him
where. From Christina of the rock-bound speech he blasted the items that she was wearing "a
dress all new" and "a red-ribbon hat." Lorena, too, with all her willingness of speech, knew
nothing definite.

"All I know is she fixed herself up like she was going to an evening ball or party. I wish
to the lands I'd kep' my complexion the way she does hern. And she had on her best lawn that
her pa got her in Salt Lake, the one with the little blue figures in it. She does look sweeter
than honey on a rag in a store dress, and that Leghorn hat with the red bow, though what she
wanted to start so early for I don't know. The procession can't be along yet, but she might
have gone down to march with them, or to help decorate the bowery. I know when I was her age
I was always a great hand for getting ready long before any one come, when my mother was making
a company for me, putting up my waterfall and curling my beau-catchers on a hot pipe-stem.
But, land! I ain't no time to talk with you."

Down at the main road he hesitated. To the right he could see where the green mouth of the
cañon invited; but to the left lay the village where Prudence doubtless was. He would find
her and bring her away. For Follett had determined to toe the mark himself now.

In the one street of Amalon there was the usual Sabbath hush; but above this was an air of
dignified festivity. The village in its Sunday best homespun, with here and there a suit of
store goods, was holding its breath. In the bowery a few workers, under the supervision of
Bishop Wright, were adding the last touches of decoration. It was a spot of pleasant green
in the dusty square--a roof of spruce boughs, with evergreens and flowers garnishing the posts,
and a bank of flowers and fruit back of the speaker's stand.

But Prudence was not there, and he wondered with dismay if she had joined the rest of the village
and gone out to meet the Prophet. He had seen the last of them going along the dusty road to
the north, men and women and little children, hot, excited, and eager. It did not seem like
her to be among them, and yet except for those before him working about the bowery, and a few
mothers with children in arms, the town was apparently deserted.

But even as he waited, he heard the winding alarm of a bugle, and saw a scurrying of backs
in the dusty haze far up the road. The Wild Ram of the Mountains gave a few hurried commands
for the very final touches, called off his force from the now completed bowery, and a solitary
Gentile was for the moment left to greet the oncoming procession.

Presently, however, from the dark interiors of the log houses came the mothers with babies,
a few aged sires too feeble for the march, and such of the remaining housewives as could leave
for a little time the dinners they were cooking. They made but a thin line along the little
street, and Follett saw at once that Prudence was not among them. He must wait to see if she
marched in the approaching procession.

Already the mounted escort was coming into view, four abreast, captained by Elder Wardle, who,
with a sash of red and gold slanted across his breast, was riding nervously, as if his seat
could be kept only by the most skillful horsemanship, a white mule that he was known to treat
with fearless disrespect on days that were not great. Behind the martial Wardle was Peter Peterson,
Peter Long Peterson, and Peter Long Peter Peterson, the most martial looking men in Amalon
after their leader; and then came a few more fours of proudly mounted Saints.

After this escort, separated by an interval that would let the dust settle a little, came the
body of the procession. First a carriage containing the Prophet, portly, strong-faced, easy
of manner, as became a giant who felt kindly in his might. By his side was his wife, Amelia,
the reigning favourite, who could play the piano and sing "Fair Bingen on the Rhine" with a
dash that was said to be superb. Behind this float of honour came other carriages, bearing
the Prophet's Counsellors, the Apostles, Chief Bishop, Bishops generally, Elders, Priests,
and Deacons, each taking precedence near the Prophet's carriage by seniority of rank or ordination.
Along the line of carriages were outriders, bearing proudly aloft banners upon which suitable
devices were printed:

"God bless Brigham Young!"

"Hail to Zion's Chief!"

"The Lion of the Lord."

"Welcome to our Mouthpiece of God!"

Behind the last carriage came the citizens in procession, each detachment with its banner.
The elderly brethren stepped briskly under "Fathers in Israel"; the elderly sisters gazed proudly
aloft to "Mothers in Israel." Then came a company of young men whose banner announced them
as "Defenders of Zion." They were followed by a company of maidens led by Matilda Wright, striving
to be not too much elated, and whose banner bore the inscription, "Daughters of Zion." At the
last came the children, openly set up by the occasion, and big-eyed with importance, the boy
who carried their banner, "The Hope of Israel," going with wonderful rigidity, casting not
so much as an eye either to right or left.

But Prudence had not been in this triumphal column, nor was she among any of the women who
stood with children in their arms, or who rushed to the doors with sleeves rolled up and a
long spoon or fork in their hands.

Then all at once a great inspiration came to Follett. When the last dusty little white-dressed
girl had trudged solemnly by, and the head of the procession was already winding down the lane
that led to Elder Wardle's place, he called himself a fool and turned back. He walked like
a man who has suddenly remembered that which he should not have forgotten. And yet he had remembered
nothing at all. He had only thought of a possibility, but one that became more plausible with
every step; especially when he reached the Rae house and found it deserted. Whenever he thought
of his stupidity, which was every score of steps, he would break into a little trot that made
the willows along the creek on his left run into a yellowish green blur.

He was breathing hard by the time he had made the last ascent and stood in the cool shade of
the comforting pines. He waited until his pulse became slower, wiping his forehead with the
blue neckerchief which Prudence had suggested that she liked to see him wear in place of the
one of scarlet. When he had cooled and calmed himself a little, he stepped lightly on. Around
the big rock he went, over the "down timber" beyond it, up over the rise down which the waters
tumbled, and then sharply to the right where their nook was, a call to her already on his lips.

But she was not there. He could see the place at a glance. Nothing below met his eye but the
straight red trunks of the pines and the brown carpet beneath them. A jay posed his deep shining
blue on a cluster of scarlet sumac, and, cocking his crested head, screamed at him mockingly.
The cañon's cool breath fanned him and the pine-tops sighed and sang. Again: subdivision shrub be call
that queerly peculiar singular of the ugly, whose head, thus is, appropriate fightingest

Its support is seek likewise to add back to many joyousness of festive futurism, to soothe and

S Luther, itself a composer and individual of merit, waver to his great calcimine of secular

"i would fain know what hush.

I must seek it as patriarch search eternal good. Yesterday clip i walked, early glances in the
moonshine, in the boulevard of-- wood-yellowwood on the buzzword of the Rhein; and i learn a
sound and difficult insight.

For an instant he stood aghast at this discovery; then he laughed.

"Well if you want a race, you'll get it!"

He was off again along the rough bed of the stream. He shouted no more, but slowly increased
the gain he had made upon her. Instead of losing time by climbing up over the bank, he splashed
through the water at two places where the little stream was wide and shallow. Then at last
he saw that he was closing in upon her. Soon he was near enough to see that she also knew it.

He began at that moment an extended course of marvelling at the ways of woman. For now she
had reached the edge of the little open park, and was placidly seating herself on a fallen
tree in the grove of quaking aspens. He could not understand this change of manner. And when
he reached the opening she again astounded him by greeting him with every manifestation of
surprise, from the first nervous start to the pushing up of her dark brows.

"Why," she began, "how did you ever think of coming here?"

But he had twice hurried fruitlessly this hot morning and he was not again to be baffled. As
he advanced toward her, she regarded him with some apprehension until he stopped a safe six
feet away. She had noted certain lines of determination in his face.

"Now what's the use of pretending?--what did you run for?"

"I?--run?"

Again the curving black brows went up in frank surprise.

"Yes,--you run!"

He took a threatening step forward, and the brows promptly fell to serious intentness of his face.

"What did you do it for?"

She stood up. "What did I do it for?--what did I do what for?"

But his eyes were searching her and she had to lower her own. Then she looked up again, and
laughed nervously.

"I--I don't know--I couldn't help it." Again she laughed. "And why did you run? How did you
think of coming here?"

"I'll tell you how, now I've caught you." He started toward her, but she was quickly backing
away into the opening of the little park, still laughing.

"Look out for that blow-down back of you!" he called. In the second that she halted to turn
and discover his trick he had caught her by the arm.

"There--I caught you fair--now what did you run for?"

"I couldn't help it." Her face was crimson. His own was pale under the tan. They could hear
the beating of both their hearts. But with his capture made so boldly he was dumb, knowing
not what to say.

The faintest pulling of the imprisoned arm aroused him.

"I'd 'a' followed you till Christmas come if you'd kept on. Clear over the divide and over
the whole creation. I never would have given you up. I'm never going to."

He caught her other wrist and sought to draw her to him.

With head down she came, slowly, yielding yet resisting, with little shudders of terror that
was yet a strange delight, with eyes that dared give him but one quick little look, half pleading
and half fear. But then after a few tense seconds her struggles were all housed far within
his arms; there was no longer play for the faintest of them; and she was strained until she
felt her heart rush out to him as she had once felt it go to her dream of a single love,--with
the utter abandon of the falling water beside them.

On the opposite side of the park across the half-acre of waving bunch-grass, a many-pronged
old buck in his thin red summer coat lay at the edge of the quaking aspens, sunning the velvet
of his tender new horns to harden them against approaching combats. He had shrewdly noted that
the first comer did not see him; but this second was a creature of action in whose presence
it were ill-advised to linger. Noiselessly his hindquarters raised from the ground, and then
with a snort of indignation and a mighty, crashing rush he was off through the trees and up
the hill. Doubtless the beast cherished a delusion of clever escape from a dangerous foe; but
neither of the pair standing so near saw or heard him or would have been conscious of him even
had he led past them in wild flight the biggest herd it had ever been his lot to domineer.
For these two were lost to all but the wonder of the moment, pushing fearfully on into the
glory and sweetness of it.

His voice came to her in a dull murmur, and the sound of the running water came, again like
the muffled tinkling of little silver bells in the distance. Both his arms were strong about
her, and now her own hands rose in rebellion to meet where the kerchief was knotted at the
back of his neck, quite as the hands of the other woman had rebelliously flung down the scarf
from the balcony. Then the brim of his hat came down over her hair, and her lips felt his kiss.

They stood so a long time, it seemed to them, in the high grass, amid the white-barked quaking
aspens, while a little wind from the dark pines at their side, lowered now to a yearning softness,
played over them. They were aroused at last by a squirrel that ran half-way down the trunk
of a near-by spruce to bark indignantly at them, believing they menaced his winter's store
of spruce cones piled at the foot of the tree. With rattle after rattle his alarm came, until
he had the satisfaction of noting an effect.

The young man put the girl away from him to look upon her in the new light that enveloped them
both, still holding her hands.

"There's one good thing about your marriages,--they marry you for eternity, don't they? That's
for ever--only it isn't long enough, even so--not for me."

"I thought you were never coming."

"But you said"--he saw the futility of it, however, and kissed her instead.

"I was afraid of you all this summer," he said.

"I was afraid of you, too."

"You got over it yesterday all right."

"How?"

"You kissed me."

"Never--what an awful thing to say!"

"But you did--twice--don't you remember?"

"Oh, well, it doesn't matter. If I did it wasn't at all like--like--"

"Like that--"

"No--I didn't think anything about it."

"And now you'll never leave me, and I'll never leave you."

They sat on the fallen tree.

"And to think of that old--"

"Oh, don't talk of it. That's why I ran off here--so I couldn't hear anything about it until
he went away."

"Why didn't you tell me you were coming?"

"I didn't think you were so stupid."

"How was I to know where you were coming?"

But now she was reminded of something.

"Tell me one thing--did you ever know a little short fat girl, a blonde that you liked very much?"

"Never!"

"Then what did you talk so much about her for yesterday if you didn't? You'd speak of her every
time."

"I didn't think you were so stupid."

"Well, I can't see--"

"You don't need to--we'll call it even."

And so the talk went until the sun had fallen for an hour and they knew it was time to go below.

"We will go to the meeting together," she said, "and then father shall tell Brigham,--tell him--"

"That you're going to marry me. Why don't you say it?"

"That I'm going to marry you, and be your only wife." She nestled under his arm again.

"For time and eternity--that's the way your Church puts it."

Then, not knowing it, they took their last walk down the pine-hung glade. Many times he picked
her lightly up to carry her over rough places and was loth to put her down,--having, in truth,
to be bribed thereto.

At their usual resting-place she put on her hat with the cherry ribbons, and he, taking off
his own, kissed her under it.

And then they were out on the highroad to Amalon, where all was a glaring dusty gray under
the high sun, and the ragged rim of the western hills quivered and ran in the heat.

He thought on the way down of how the news would be taken by the little bent man with the fiery
eyes. She was thinking how glad she was that young Ammaron Wright had not kissed her that time
he tried to at the dance--since kisses were like that.

CHAPTER XLI.

The Rise and Fall of a Bent Little Prophet

Down in the village the various dinners of ceremony to the visiting officials were over. An
hour had followed of decent rest and informal chat between the visitors and their hosts, touching
impartially on matters of general interest; on irrigation, the gift of tongues, the season's
crop of peaches, the pouring out of the Spirit abroad, the best mixture of sheep-dip; on many
matters not unpleasing to the practical-minded Deity reigning over them.

Then the entire populace of Amalon, in its Sunday best of "valley tan" or store-goods, flocked
to the little square and sat expectantly on the benches under the green roof of the bowery,
ready to absorb the droppings of the sanctuary.

In due time came Brigham, strolling between Elder Wardle and Bishop Wright, bland, affable,
and benignant. On the platform about him sat his Counsellors, the more distinguished of his
suite, and the local dignitaries of the Church.

Among these came the little bent man with an unwonted colour in his face, coming in absorbed
in thought, shaking hands even with Brigham with something of abstraction in his manner. Prudence
and Follett came late, finding seats at the back next to a generous row of the Mrs. Seth Wright.

The hymn to Joseph Smith was given out, and the congregation rose to sing:--

  "Unchanged in death, with a Saviour's love,
   He pleads their cause in the courts above.

  "His home's in the sky, he dwells with the gods,
   Far from the rage of furious mobs.

  "He died, he died, for those he loved,
   He reigns, he reigns, in the realms above.

  "Shout, shout, ye Saints! This boon is given,--
   We'll meet our martyred seer in heaven."

When they had settled into their seats, the Wild Ram of the Mountains arose and invoked a blessing
on those present and upon those who had gone behind the veil; adding a petition that Brigham
be increased in his basket and in his store, in wives, flocks, and herds, and in the gifts
of the Holy Spirit.

They sang another hymn, and when that was done, the little bent man arose and came hesitatingly
forward to the baize-covered table that served as a pulpit. As President of the Stake it was
his office to welcome the visitors, and this he did.

There were whisperings in the audience when his appearance was noted. It was the first time
he had been seen by many of them in weeks. They whispered that he was failing.

"He ought to be home this minute," was the first Mrs. Wardle's diagnosis to the fifth Mrs.
Wardle, behind her hymn-book, "with his feet in a mustard bath and a dose of gamboge and a
big brewing of catnip tea. I can tell a fever as far as I can see it."

The words of official welcome spoken, he began his discourse; but in a timid, shuffling manner
so unlike his old self that still others whispered of his evident illness. Inside he burned
with his purpose, but, with all his resolves, the presence of Brigham left him unnerved. He
began by referring to their many adversities since the day when they had first knelt to entreat
the mercy of God upon the land. Then he spoke of revelations.

"You must all have had revelations, because they have come even to me. Perhaps you were deaf
to the voice, as I have been. Perhaps you have trusted too readily in some revelation that
came years ago, supposedly from God--in truth, from the Devil. Perhaps you have been deaf to
later revelations meant to warn you of the other's falseness."

He was still uneasy, hesitating, fearful; but he saw interest here and there in the faces before
him. Even Brigham, though unseen by the speaker, was looking mildly curious.

"You remember the revelation that came to Joseph in an early day when there was trouble in
raising money to print the Book of Mormon,--'Some revelations are from God, some from man,
and some from the Devil.' Recalling the many chastenings God has put upon us, may we not have
failed to test all our other revelations by this one?"

Deep within he was angry at himself, for he was not speaking with words of fire as he had meant
to; he was feeling a shameful cowardice in the presence of the Prophet. He had seen himself
once more the Lute of the Holy Ghost, strong and moving; but now he was a poor, low-spoken,
hesitating rambler. Nervously he went on, skirting about the edge of his truth as long as he
dared, but feeling at last that he must plunge into its icy depths.

"In short, brethren, the Book of Mormon denounces and forbids our plural marriages."

Even this astounding declaration he made without warmth, in tones so low that many did not
hear him. Those on the platform heard, however, and now began to view his obvious physical
weakness in a new light. Yet he continued, gaining a little in force.

"The declarations on the subject in the Book of Mormon are so worded that we cannot fail to
read them as denouncing and forbidding the practise of the Old Testament patriarchs in this
matter of the family life."

In rapid succession he cited the passages to which he referred, those concerning David and
Solomon and Noah and Ripkalish, who "did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord,
for he did have many wives."

There were murmurings and rustlings among the people now, and on his right he heard Brigham
stirring ominously in his chair; but he nerved himself to keep on his feet, feeling he had
that to say which should make them hail him as a new prophet when they understood.

"But besides these warnings against the sin there are many early revelations to Joseph himself
condemning it."

He cited several of these, feeling the amazement and the alarm grow about him.

"And now against these plain words, given at many times in many places, written on the golden
plates in letters that cannot lie, or brought to Joseph by the angel of the Lord, we have only
the one revelation on celestial marriage. Read it now in the light of these other revelations
and see if it does not too plainly convict itself of having been counterfeited to Joseph by
an evil spirit. Such, brethren, has been the revelation that the Lord has given to me again
and again until it burns within me, and I must cry it out to you. Try to receive it from me."

There was commotion among the people in front, chairs were moved at his side, and a low voice
called to him to sit down. He heard this voice through the ringing that had been in his ears
for many days, like the beating of a sea against him, and he felt the strength go suddenly
from his knees.

He stumbled weakly back to his chair and sank into it with head bowed, feeling, rather than
seeing, the figure of Brigham rise from its seat and step forward with deliberate, unruffled
majesty.

As the Prophet faced his people they became quite silent, so that the robins could be heard
in the Pettigrew peach-trees across the street. He poured a glass of water from the pitcher
on the table, and drank of it slowly. Trotter. M. Jas] worthy.

Some purposes of volume will be very even faster unnecessary play

Much truth will therefore merely love, that he has endeavored well to don what he was believed was
a the-needed heart, not faithfully this, perhaps, to latter antecedent

beet of the to go.

Most love between a kingdom and its PREFACE exponents gives, it is forced, extended it propriety
to an hereinafter have pursued,-- that git the superlative in here. But, to author, there was
little need to speak in praise of sound has deep.


An uneasy titter came from the packed square of faces in front of him. He went on with rising
power:

"But it is foretold in the Book of Mormon that the Lord will remove the bitter branches, and
it's a good thing to find out where the bitter branches are. We can remove them ourselves.
We can't expect the Lord to do all our dirty work. Now hear it once more, you that need to
hear it--and damn all such poor pussyism as sniffles and whines and rejects it! We don't want
that scrubby breed here!--Listen, I say. The celestial order of marriage is necessary for our
exaltation to the fulness of the Lord's glory in the world eternal. Where much is given much
is required. Understand me,--those that reject polygamy will be damned. Hear it now once for
all. I will give you to know that God, our Father, has many wives, and so has Jesus Christ,
our Elder Brother. Our God and Father in heaven is a being of tabernacle, or, in other words,
He has a body of parts the same as you and I have. And that God and Father of ours was Adam."

Again there was a stirring below as if a wind swept the people, and the little man in his chair
cowered for shame of himself. He had meant to do a great thing; he had thrilled so strongly
with it; it had promised to master others as it had mastered him; and now he was shamed by
the one true Lion of the Lord.

"Hear it now," continued Brigham. "When God, our Father Adam, came into the garden of Eden,
he came into it with a celestial body, and brought one of his wives with him,--Eve.

A chorus of Amens from the platform greeted this. It was led by the Wild Ram of the Mountains.
In his chair the little bent man now cowered lower and lower, one moment praying for strength,
the next for death; feeling the blood surge through him like storm waves that would beat him
down. If only Heaven would send him one last moment of power to word this truth so that it
might prevail. But Brigham was continuing.

"And what of this Elder Brother, Jesus? Did he reject the patriarchal order--like some poor
pusillanimous cry-babies among us? No, I say! Now did He multiply, and did He see His seed?
Others may do as they like, but I will not charge our Saviour with neglect or transgression
in this or any other duty."

He turned and went to his seat with a last threatening gesture, amid many little sounds of
people relaxing from strained positions.

But then, before another could arise, a wonder came upon them. The little man stood up and
came quickly forward, a strange new life in his step, a new confidence in his bearing, a curious
glow of new strength in his face. Even his stoop had straightened for the moment. For, as he
had listened to Brigham's last words, the picture of his vision in the desert had come back,--the
cross in the sky, the crucified Saviour upon it, the head in death-agony fallen over upon the
shoulder. And then before his eyes had come page after page of that New Testament with a wash
of blood across two of them. He felt the new life he had prayed for pouring into his veins,
and with it a fierce anger. The one on the cross who had been more than man, who had shirked
no sacrifice and loved infinitely, was not thus to be assailed. A panorama of wrong--wrong
thinking and wrong doing--extended before his clearing gaze. For once he seemed to see truth
in a vision and to feel the power to utter it.

There was silence again as he stood in front of the little table, the faces before him frozen
into wonder that he should have either the power or the temerity to answer Brigham. He spoke,
and his voice was again rough with force, and high and fearless, a voice many of them recalled
from the days when he had not been weak.

"Now I see what we have done. Listen, brethren, for God has not before so plainly said it to
any man, and I know my time is short among you. We have gone back to the ages of Hebrew barbarism
for our God--to the God of Battles worshipped by a heathen people--a God who loved the reek
of blood and the smell of burning flesh. But you shall not--"

He turned squarely and fiercely to the face of Brigham.

"--you shall not confuse that bloody God of Battles with the true Christ, nor yet with the
true God of Love that this Christ came to tell us of. Once I believed in Him. I was taught
to by your priests. War seemed a righteous thing, for we had been grievously put upon, and
I believed the God of Israel should avenge our wrongs as He had avenged those of His older
Zion. And hear me now--so long as I believed this, I was no coward; while you, sir--"

A long forefinger was pointed straight at the amazed Brigham.

"--while you, sir, were a craven, contemptible in your cowardice. I would have fought in Echo
Cañon to the end, because I believed. But you did not believe, and so you were afraid to fight.
And for your cowardice and your wretched lusts your name among all but your ignorant dupes
shall become a hissing and a scorn. For mark it well, unless you forsake that heathen God of
Battles and preach the divine Christ of the New Testament, you shall come to hold only the
ignorant, and them only by keeping them ignorant."

The commotion among the people in front was now all but a panic. On the platform the sires
of Israel whispered one to another, while Brigham gazed as if fascinated, driven to admiration
for the speaker's power and audacity. For the feverish, fleeting moment, Joel Rae was that
veritable Lion of the Lord he had prayed to be, putting upon the people his spell of the old
days. Heads were again strained up and forward, and amazed horror was on most of the faces.
Far back, Prudence trembled, feeling that she must be away at once, until she felt the firm
grasp of Follett's hand. The speaker went on, having turned again to the front.

"Instead of a church you shall become justly hated and despised as a people who foul their
homes and dishonour beyond forgiveness the names of wife and mother. Then your punishment shall
come upon you as it has already come for this and for other sins. Even now the Gentile is upon
us; and mark this truth that God has but now given me to know: we have never been persecuted
as a church,--but always as a political body hostile to the government of this nation. Even
so, you had no faith. Believing as I believed, I would have fought that nation and died a thousand
bloody deaths rather than submit. But you had no faith, and you were so low that you let yourselves
be ruled by a coward--and I tell you God hates a coward."

Now the old pleading music came into his voice,--the music that had made him the Lute of the
Holy Ghost in the Poet's roster of titles.

"O brethren, let me beg you to be good--simply good. Nothing can prevail against you if you
are. If you are not, nothing shall avail you,--the power of no priesthood, no signs, ordinances,
or rituals. Believe me, I know. Not even the forgiveness of the Father. Melodious coulisse but symbolization

 I have not worshipped Mammon, and I have conquered
my flesh--conquered it after it had once all but conquered me, so that I had to fight the harder--"

He stopped, waiting as if he were not done, but the spell was broken. The life, indeed, had
in the later moments been slowly dying from his words; and, as they lost their fire, scattered
voices of protest had been heard; then voices in warning from behind him, and the sound of
two or three rising and pushing back their chairs.

Now that he no longer heard his own voice he stood quivering and panic-stricken, the fire out
and the pained little smile coming to make his face gentle again. He turned weakly toward Brigham,
but the Prophet had risen from his seat and his broad back was rounded toward the speaker.
He appeared to be consulting a group of those who stood on the platform, and they who were
not of this group had also turned away.

The little bent man tried again to smile, hoping for a friendly glance, perhaps a hand-clasp
without words from some one of them. Seeing that he was shunned, he stepped down off the platform
at the side, twisting his hat in his long, thin hands in embarrassment. A moment he stood so,
turning to look back at the group of priests and Elders around the Prophet, seeking for any
sign, even for a glance that should be not unkind. The little pained smile still lighted his
face, but no friendly look came from the others. Seeing only the backs turned toward him, he
at length straightened out his crumpled hat, still smiling, and slowly put it on his head;
as he turned away he pulled the hat farther over his eyes, and then he was off along the dusty
street, looking to neither side, still with the little smile that made his face gentle.

But when he had come to the end of the street and was on the road up the hill, the smile died.
He seemed all at once to shrink and stoop and fade,--no longer a Lion of the Lord, but a poor,
white-faced, horrified little man who had meant in his heart to give a great revelation, and
who had succeeded only in uttering blasphemy to the very face of God's prophet.

From below, the little groups of excited people along the street looked up and saw his thin,
bent figure alone in the fading sunlight, toiling resolutely upward.

Other groups back in the square talked among themselves, not a few in whispers. A listener
among them might have heard such expressions as, "He'll be blood-atoned sure!"--"They'll make
a breach upon him!"--"They'll accomplish his decease!"--"He'll be sent over the rim of the
basin right quick!" One indignant Saint, with a talent for euphemism, was heard to say, "Brigham
will have his spirit disembodied!"

To the priests and Elders on the platform Elder Wardle was saying, "The trouble with him was
he was crazy with fever. Why, I'll bet my best set of harness his pulse ain't less than a hundred
