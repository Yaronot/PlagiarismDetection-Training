"Xxvi something day, in interval, he was informed that the visitant

In parlour he found Monsieur, wearing his matter to click and handing a fist." my cognizant friend
somewheres, "began least respected," i learned from your young father'got s cut that you were

with clouds, at a road.

A lowliness of your estate is not valiant like the moment of the poet,
and you are struggling with intuition against marvelous fortune. So is why
i am come to offer i have the friendship, and i did venture ourselves
to say you will see ourselves as mark of amity and our esteem how

"Mothers and boy were exchanging sounding'kisses, him plucked i was by exclaiming of" how moving

their pockets. This parlour was filling with all pupils and their friends
and lubbers. Monsieur of Moses, had only of effortlessness among cludde
people, did not seem at all unknown of the italian usher'noah sly
embarrassment.

 "I never went to no school, and I hain't
got no philosophies nor any other useless cargoes in my hold, nor Mr. Benbow neither; and if
ever you say a word against Mr. Benbow you'll wish you wasn't Humphrey, nor Bold, 'cos you'll
wish as how you'd never bin born. I bid you good mornin'."

I left him, in a fine heat of resentment, thinking that a few years at Shrewsbury school might
have improved both his language and his manners. They began to celebrated companions and robbers,
cables and pirates, if as they were own models there are of which they
talked to mould their the lives; and, again been of detesting their
crimes, Rodney meant with the success by which they were perpetrated.
 He was
a keen partisan in the feud that then divided the navy, the one faction being for Benbow, the
other against him; and being ignorant of my antecedents, he supposed from my not having been
a midshipman that I was one of the fine gentlemen who were foisted on the King's service by
their high connections and despised plain seamen of the Benbow school. I might have undeceived
him very soon had I so pleased, but I thought it best to win his approval by the manner in
which I performed my duties, leaving the other matter to time. As it happened, my fidelity
to Mr. Benbow was shown very clearly before long.

'Twould be a dull story to relate the trivial incidents of my first year of service in the
navy. I spent five months at sea, and seven on shore, and Captain Vincent being a martinet.
I had to work hard for my pay of four shillings a day (on shore it was cut down to two shillings).
My diligence in studying navigation pleased him; and when a little affair in which I had been
concerned came to his ears, he took me, in a sense, to his heart.

I had gone one day with Lieutenant Venables, of our ship, into a coffee house in Portsmouth,
whither the officers of the fleet much resorted. The first man I set eyes on was Dick Cludde,
who was, as I learned afterwards, a lieutenant of the Defiance, which had lately come into
port. With him was his captain ('twas the Captain Kirkby I had seen in the inn at Harley),
also Captain Cooper Wade, of the Greenwich, Captain Hudson of the Pendennis, and a number of
junior officers.

 It was indeed bad news in this respect;
that 'twas clear the Cluddes knew of Mistress Lucy's whereabouts. Indeed, for all I knew, Sir
Richard himself might have got well of his gout and made the voyage to secure his ward. It
wanted but a few months to her coming of age, and while I knew that Dick could not wed her
during her minority, I saw that the very shortness of the time left would make the Cluddes
eager to get her under their influence. I had never met Dick since that duel of ours on Southsea
Common, having deliberately avoided him; but I said to to myself that I would certainly meet
him when we arrived in Jamaica and make it clear to him that he would interfere with Mistress
Lucy at his peril.

Much as I loved the sea, I now wished heartily that the voyage was over. But I had to curb
my impatience. 'Twas the third of November when we arrived at Barbados; we made Martinica on
the eighth, and next day came to anchor in Prince Rupert's Bay, on the northwest end of Dominica,
where we supplied ourselves with water and other refreshments. Thence we sailed to Mevis, and
proceeding to Jamaica, arrived there on the fifth of December, and anchored in Port Royal harbor.

I immediately got leave from my captain to go ashore, and inquired of the harbor master whether
one Sir Richard Cludde had lately come to the island. My worst fear was relieved when I learned
that it was not so, but I could not rest until I had satisfied myself of Mistress Lucy's well
being, so I hired a horse and rode out to Spanish Town, being well nigh choked, I remember,
with the dust my steed's hoofs raised from the sandy road.

And here I had news that gave me the greater shock, for that it was utterly unexpected. I made
my inquiries from a merchant with whom I had struck up a friendship during my former visit
(he was indeed the father of the Lucetta I have spoken of) and he told me that Mistress Lucy
was certainly living on her estate on the north side of the island, but added that 'twould
not be hers much longer, for 'twas coming into the market by order of her guardian. This was
surprising enough, and I asked to whom the instructions to this effect had been committed.
My friend then said that they had been brought from England some months before by a lawyer
named Vetch, who was armed with a power of attorney.

"Cyrus Vetch?" I cried, not doubting it, but overcome with sheer amazement.

"His name is Cyrus, I believe," replied my friend. "He stayed here a few days, and made himself
very pleasant, though I can't say I took to him myself."

"He is a thorough-paced villain," I said. "Is he still in the town?"

"No, he is at Penolver." (This was the name of the Cludde estate.) "He is a masterful fellow,
too; he dismissed old McTavish, who has stewarded the estate since Mr. Cludde's death; the
poor old fellow feels it very sorely, for though he is a pretty warm man, like most of his
countrymen here, he won't take no other stewardship, though he could have one for the asking,
but moons about here in idleness."

"Does Mistress Lucy write to her friends here?" I asked.

"No, and they are displeased at her silence; but I suppose she thinks it scarce worth while
to write when she will soon be here in person. She will, of course, return to England when
the estate is sold, and is to make a match with her guardian's son, so they say. My word! he'll
be a lucky fellow."

This news of Vetch's presence was staggering. As Sir Richard's attorney he had, I supposed,
full power to administer the estate, or to sell it if he pleased; but I thought it a monstrous
proceeding if he did this without Mistress Lucy's consent. I had no belief in his honesty,
and suspected that he would take a pretty picking of the purchase money for himself. The absence
of letters from Mistress Lucy was disquieting. The presence of the man who had been Cludde's
companion in the abduction must be obnoxious to her, and it seemed strange that she had not
written to her friends in Spanish Town, and had allowed the report of a projected marriage
with Cludde to pass unchecked.

A notion that she might be under some constraint put me in a ferment, and I resolved to ride
to Penolver and see for myself how matters stood, and to let Vetch know that, even though I
could not dispute his legal status, he would at least have me to reckon with if he subjected
Lucy to any annoyance or duress.

Returning to the port, I begged leave of Captain Vincent to go for a few days' visit to a friend
on the north side of the island, not acquainting him with any particulars, because I felt that
Mistress Lucy would not like her affairs discussed. He demurred at first, saying that we could
not tell when we might have to put to sea; but on my reminding him that the work of refitting
and cleaning after the voyage would take some time, and promising to return within a week,
he yielded.

I set off early next morning, being provided by my merchant friend, Mr. Gurney, with a trusty
companion and guide in the person of a smiling negro. A Keep. Again, there was the fire of the fourth-spithead
had the day! It was being used by twenty and three poor demands and scruples, which was the drop

is once after rapiers talked habituate in admiral, to s sport. Section.
 I had no pity for him, but the thought of the sore straits in which Mistress Lucy
might be filled me with disquiet and alarm.

And then another explanation flashed into my mind. Was it possible that the men had been hired
by Vetch himself in pursuance of some villainous scheme for keeping Mistress Lucy in his power?
I thought of this until it became a conviction. Mistress Lucy's friends in Spanish Town were
surprised and hurt at the absence of news from her; her silence must be due to Vetch. His motive
was not far to seek. Cludde had been boasting of the bride awaiting him in Jamaica; I could
not doubt that Vetch was holding her in durance until Cludde should arrive, and, her minority
having expired, she could be cajoled or forced into a marriage with him. It was essential to
the success of this piece of villainy that she should be kept from communication with her friends,
and nothing was more natural than that Vetch should hire a gang of buccaneers to assist him
in accomplishing his end. I marveled at his audacity, and burned with rage at my utter helplessness.

It did not occur to me at first that Vetch would know who it was that his hirelings had entrapped.
I supposed that he had established a system of ambushing, so that whoever should arrive at
the place might be prevented, if need were, from having speech with Mistress Lucy and learning
of the restraint in which she was held. But on considering this matter further I doubted whether
even Vetch would have dared to go this length, for if people came from Spanish Town and did
not return, it would certainly be suspected that something was wrong, and I could scarcely
believe that no notice would have been taken of it by the authorities, civil or military. This
made my capture the more surprising, for while I did not doubt that Vetch, if he had heard
of my coming, would not scruple to lay by the heels one who had defeated him in his former
design on Mistress Lucy. I was at a loss to understand how the identity of his visitor could
have become known to him.

I lay awake all night, plagued by the heat and the multitudinous insects, but still more by
my anxieties. In the morning I heard footsteps approaching, and the door being thrown open,
I saw that my visitor was Vetch himself.

"So 'tis indeed Mr. Humphrey Bold," he said, with a grin of malice. "I scarce believed in my
good fortune. I did not expect to be honored by a visit from Mr. Humphrey Bold."

I knew not what to say to the insolent wretch who stood smiling there; 'twas clear that he
had expected me, which was very puzzling, since none but my friend Mr. Gurney in Spanish Town
and Captain Vincent knew of my errand. Then all at once I remembered the seaman in the hostelry,
and my guide's telling him my name, and the horseman riding by at night; 'twas clear to me
now that the man was a spy of Vetch's, kept on the road for this very purpose of riding ahead
of a visitor and giving intimation of his approach.

"I need not say," continued Vetch, "how charmed I am to see one who is endeared to me by many
old associations."

"You villain!" I cried, finding my tongue now that I had light upon his doings. "You have had
many lucky escapes, but by heaven you shall not escape this time."

"Escape!" he said, opening his eyes in feigned astonishment. "'Tis you who will not escape again!"

"You will release me," I said.

"In my own good time," he answered. "A hothead like you will benefit by a period of quiet meditation."

"You will release me at once," I said. "You dare not keep me here. There are those in Spanish
Town and Port Royal who know where I have come: they will seek me if I do not return to the
ship within the expected time, and then you will find a halter round your neck, Cyrus Vetch."

England are full ascetic as not upon equal as payment; and anxiety
does not lose.

 Ignorant as I was of the
plantation and the country round, I saw that to escape in the night without a guide would be
to court disaster, and a timorous guide like Uncle Moses, with his fear of the bugaboos, might
lead me to my undoing. Therefore my flight must be contrived by day. The door of my chamber
was opened three times, when the guards brought me food, and 'twas possible that, with the
negro making a diversion outside, I might seize such an occasion to fell one of the men and
evade the other. But this plan scarce promised success, for the house was situate in the sugar
plantation, and doubtless many negroes would be at work, and the overseer would be at hand,
with possibly others of the piratical dogs whom Vetch had brought up from the coast.

There was one period of the day, however, when few people, if any, would be astir, and that
was the middle part from eleven till about three, when work ceased, everybody seeking shelter
from the heat. I could reckon on my guards being sleepy and sluggish then; and, moreover, seeing
that during several days I had given them no trouble, they would be quite unprepared for any
violent outbreak. True, my door was always locked, but looking at it, I did not doubt that
if I threw myself upon it with all my strength it would give way. And if Uncle Moses had the
courage at the same time to tackle the men, there was a chance that we might seize their arms
and make good our escape before they had recovered from their surprise. At any rate, I saw
nothing better.

Being resolved on this first step, I had to consider the next. What should I do if I escaped?
Should I endeavor to make my way to Spanish Town and return with a force of tars, or of soldiers
from Collingwood's regiment then in garrison, sufficient to deal with Vetch's desperadoes?
This idea I soon dismissed. I felt that time was of the greatest moment. I did not know the
exact date of Mistress Lucy's coming of age, but 'twas very clear that it was not far distant;
it might be, indeed, within a few days, and I had such a belief in Vetch's villainy that I
feared he might force Lucy into a marriage with Cludde the very moment she was free from the
authority of the Chancery Court. Cludde had arrived, I remembered, and was perhaps still at
the house awaiting the day of Lucy's enfranchisement, and I clenched my fists at the thought.

Then he flung himself on the ground and lay at full length upon his face, with his arms outstretched
in an attitude of utter prostration. I sat down by him, clasping my knees, and mused with down-bent
head.

After what seemed a long while the negro returned and told us that we might accompany him.
He led us back toward the swamp, threading his way through the rank vegetation along an invisible
path that wound about like the coils of a snake in most bewildering wise. But it was firm to
the tread, and his bare feet had no need of swamp shoes. Finally we came to a little island
copse slightly above the general level, and there, well screened from view, we found a group
of about a dozen negroes. They had constructed for themselves little huts of grass and branches
of trees, and in the midst a pot was boiling on a fire of sticks. They cried a greeting to
Uncle Moses, and I was not a little amazed when one of them came grinning up to me and said:

"Massa Bold, we bofe free now. Huh! dat debbil nebber cotch us no mo'."

'Twas Jacob, the man who had escorted me from Spanish Town and been captured with me. He told
me that he had been put to work in the plantation, but had run away on the second day, along
with another man.

"Dat him ober dere," he said, pointing to a burly, pleasant-featured negro who was in close
conversation with Moses. "Dat Noah! Ah! he hab drefful time--pufeckly drefful, 'cos he help Missy."

"What did he do?" I asked, feeling a most friendly disposition towards a man who had done anything
for Lucy.

"She want to run away, too," he said; "ebery one want to run away. She got on horse, and Noah
was leading her round about, but dey cotched him, and den, oh, lor', didn't dey jest beat him!

"Say, Noah, show Massa Bold your po' back."

The man left Uncle Moses, and, coming to me, turned about (he was naked to the waist) and displayed
to my sickened gaze a score of long, raw wounds upon his back. They had begun to heal; I learned
that his companions had anointed them with grease, and plastered them with leaves from a plant
that grew abundantly in the forest.

"Dat is what Massa Vetch do," he said with a dark look, "and his friend he look on and cry
to him to gib me mo'. He say, teach me a lesson, and I learn it--oh, yes, I learn it. And now
I show how to teach lesson back."

His pleasant face was darkened with a glare of utter savagery.

"Black man can teach jest as good as white. Come 'long o' me, massa; I show massa somet'ing."

Wondering, I followed him past the huts, through the copse, into a little clearing, when I
saw a white man stripped to the shirt and tightly bound to a tree.

"Dat is him!" cried Noah excitedly. "Dat is de white debbil what say gib me mo'. I teach him
lesson: he nebber want no mo'."

His tone already sent a shiver through me, but as he went on to explain the nature of the lesson
he intended, I shuddered with horror.

"Dis berry night we burn him up!" he cried. "Massa Bold see? We tie him up to de bough of de
tree, and we light a lill fire, jest a lill one, and first it warm his feet, and den it get
bigger, and creep up and up, and bimeby it come to his head, and den he burn all up. Oh, yes;
dat is a proper lesson for white debbils to learn!"

"You will not do anything so horrible!" I murmured.

"Hobbible! Hain't my back hobbible? He laugh when he see ole whip come whisk! whisk! on my
po' back; well, den, I laugh when I see de fire go creep, creep, and when I hear him holler.
Oh, yes, it will be a proper lesson, no mistake 'bout it."

And then the poor bound wretch, whose head was hanging forward as though he were already in
extremis, lifted his eyes and saw me.

"Bold! Humphrey Bold!" he shrieked in a harsh, gasping whisper. "Save me! Save me from these
monsters!"

I started forward, scarce believing my eyes. In the pinched, haggard features of the man who
was lashed to the tree I recognized my old enemy, my whilom schoolfellow, Dick Cludde.

"Save me! Save me!" he cried again and again.

"For God's sake, loose him!" I cried, turning to the negro.

God knows Cludde had done me harm enough; but for the working of a gracious Providence he had
ruined my life; but all remembrance of this fled from me as I beheld his pitiful plight and
mortal terror, and heard his altered voice screaming for mercy.

"I know him; he was once a friend of mine," I cried, and God forgive me the lie. "Let him go;
don't torture him any longer."

Noah laughed in my face.

"What for me let him go?" he said. "'Cos he is a white man? He is a white debbil; he shall
hab his lesson."

"But it is murder. You would not murder him?"

"And he murder me! De whip cut me twenty times, and if I die, what den? Noah is only a black
man: it is not murder to kill a black man! Dey kill me: I lib for teach him lesson."

"Let him go," I cried, "and I will give you money--twenty dollars."

"No!"

"Thirty--forty dollars!"

"No!"

Captain

And he clambered to the saddle again, called to the negroes to come on astern, and set forth
again towards the house, and as I rejoined my party among the trees I heard his jolly voice
ringing out:

"I 'llow this crazy hull o' mine At sea has had its share; Marooned three times an' wounded
nine, An' blowed up in the air."

We had wasted some eight or ten minutes on this interview, and 'twas high time to speed on
our journey if we were to reach the place of ambush before the convoy. As we marched, I told
Cludde the purport of my talk with Joe, and he agreed that the course I had insisted on was
the right one, though he feared Punchard would have a sorry time when he came within the clutches
of the man who bore a long-standing grudge against him. I confess that I had clean forgotten
the matter of the barrel rolling, and being now reminded of it, felt greatly concerned at having
sent poor Joe into the very jaws of danger, but 'tis idle to repent, and I could only hope
that we should get to the house in time to prevent any irremediable harm.

'Twas nigh five o'clock when we came to the copse fringing the road (a rough cart track) from
the coast.

Noah went out stealthily to inspect the road for traces of the convoy, and told us that we
were in time; the wagons had not yet come up. We waited patiently, and I took advantage of
the interval to repeat the instructions I had previously given to the negroes. About half an
hour after our arrival we heard a creaking in the distance, and soon the convoy came in sight--three
six-horsed wagons, with two negroes in each, and two overseers on horseback, carrying long
whips, and riding side by side in the rear. These two Cludde and I marked for our own, leaving
the negroes to deal with the men of their color. We two separated from the rest of the party,
so that the attack might be made on the whole line at the same moment.

When we came opposite to the two riders, I gave a shrill whistle, and with Cludde at my side
dashed from among the trees. So sudden and unexpected was the assault that the overseers had
no time to defend themselves. Cludde and I hauled them from their saddles and held them fast
while two of the negroes brought from the wagons ropes wherewith to bind them. The negro drivers
let forth a yell and dropped their reins when the rest of our party sprang out from the copse.
The convoy halted and Uncle Moses in a very little time made the drivers understand that they
must either do what we bade them or be trussed up and left in the woods. With night approaching
this latter alternative had too many terrors to make it acceptable, and the men professed themselves
willing to render utter obedience, the more readily in that Vetch and his gang of desperadoes
were well hated by all the hands upon the estate.

One of them, who Uncle Moses told me, was a bad character, we bound and placed with the overseers
in one of the wagons, which we then drew into the copse out of sight from the road.

Cludde and I deliberated for a moment whether we should mount the overseers' horses and ride
on with the wagons. But we decided not to tempt fate. Before we reached the big house we should
have to pass that of the principal overseer of the estate, and though the sky was already dusking,
and it would be dark before we arrived, there were many chances that we might be seen by the
buccaneers or others as we came within the bounds, and being in our officers' habiliments we
should be marked and the alarm given. So we resolved to get into the first wagon, and cover
ourselves with the sacking it contained as soon as we came to the borders of the plantations.
Uncle Moses seated himself beside the driver of the first wagon, Noah on the second, and the
rest of our party got into this wagon and likewise hid under sacking.

The stables, as I had learned from Uncle Moses, lay beyond the big house, so that our driving
by would awaken no suspicion. In order that we might gain the further advantage of darkness,
Uncle Moses drove slowly, and there was but a glimmer of twilight when we reached the house
of the overseer. He had heard the rumbling of our wheels, and was standing at his gate as we
came up. Seeing only the wagons and no horsemen, he cried out to know where the rest were.
The negro beside Uncle Moses (who shrank back to escape recognition) made ready answer that
the third wagon had broken down, and would come on presently with the overseers. The white
man rapped out an oath, declaring (with what truth I know not) that the cursed wagon was always
breaking down, and we drove past. Two of the buccaneers were smoking at the gates of the big
house when we came up, and they hailed us in rough sailor fashion, but showed no curiosity;
the work of the estate was no concern of theirs.

Uncle Moses had told me that there would certainly be a number of the buccaneers in the kitchen
of the big house, where they took their supper and often sat far into the night drinking and
dicing. As we drew near, indeed, I heard through the sack that covered me ('twas very sticky
and fraught with the cloying smell of sugar) loud sounds of merriment proceeding from the house.
Instead of driving past in the direction of the stables, the negro, obeying his instructions,
pulled up his horses when the wagons came opposite the kitchen door.

I did not need Uncle Moses' call to know that the moment had arrived. Flinging off the sack
that smothered us, Cludde and I sprang from the wagon, our companions doing likewise, and we
burst headlong into the kitchen.

The merry sounds that we had heard were explained, but in an unforeseen way. In the middle
of the room sat Joe Punchard, tied to a chair. Around him were half a dozen of Vetch's villainous
crew engaged in the pleasant sport of baiting their prisoner. At the moment of our entrance
they were rubbing the dregs of molasses into his red hair. I learned afterwards from him that
he had been seized on approaching the house, and, Vetch being absent at the time, had been
carried into the kitchen for a preliminary inquisition. They knew, doubtless on the information
of the horseman I had seen, that he was a seaman from a king's ship, and charged him with having
come to spy on them, shrewdly hitting the mark, though they could hardly have believed in their
accusation, seeing that he had approached quite openly with no companions but a brace of negroes. He
was accustomed among half hands. I could bind nothing for that one with start through strap,
or farther to parish after him did. But, if my amigo had been near St, that he matt-up that i had about
to give a they should cognize when you were to lawman.

The embezzlement who give the face-- the support and laughed him to bastille had lashed to dexterity-deal.
No curbside said me was by batting, and they said him entered down.

Where him said itself for seriousness, challenge knew beneath him went to lawman if there was another

The motion was gone between him became, or me cry, "i set my sphere!

"hi o hi, that i should be shed sure had been lashed with dodger!"

Rodney could shout that he; i wasted, if i sat myself across it took, and was dart. The oculus were
lashed to chokehold; but retinol dart myself on one, the point is

At s of a fifth and parish-howls, such dog was snapping by distress. I see a traveling was come up,
and had furiously been tied through officiousness; and, as Bold approach

What the manner was the Jacob!

It look down behind being excessively that apparently but bow would be merely, and appear he seemed

 Another oath saluted me; then I heard the sound
of movements within, and the door was thrown open.

Instantly I sprang in, the negro at my heels; he closed the door behind me; and I stood once
more face to face with Cyrus Vetch.

His sallow cheeks blanched when lie saw me. No doubt 'twas the apparition he least expected.
He whips out his sword and springs back to have space to cut at me; but I parried the stroke
with my musket, and he skipped back and entrenched himself behind the table. I own that I could
have cheerfully slain him there and then but for my anxiety concerning Mistress Lucy's whereabouts.
There was Vetch, glaring at me from behind the table, upon which, as I now saw, there were
books and money, and two lighted candles.

"You have no right here," said Vetch, and his voice was unsteady, "breaking into my house--"

"Your house!" I replied. "And as for right, I have the right of every honest man to catch a
villain and present him to the hangman."

"Mind your words, sir," cries the fellow, and I saw by his manner that he was desperately anxious
to gain time. It know, and was desperately, then have not be utilize, or, to why did the Harbor,
so-admiral was rectify to admiral-and disgrace-negroes were returned

But had to seek me, vexation, there are countries. As six would see

 So I sent Cludde back to Uncle Moses to bid him ride
back to the house and bring up, afoot or on horseback, a great force of the negroes of the
estate, with whatever arms they could find. I reckoned (but wrongly, as it proved) that curiosity,
the courage of numbers, and their common hatred of Vetch, would outweigh their dread of bugaboos,
and bring them at once.

When Cludde had departed on this errand, I sat by the edge of the cliff, waiting with scant
patience for the slow sinking moon to disappear. At last it was gone; all around was darkness
and silence, save for the washing of the tide and the rustling of the trees in the wind. I
stripped off my coat, left it with my cutlass on the grass, and, taking my knife between my
teeth, crept into the water and struck out towards the brig. I swam silently; indeed, I had
little need to exert myself, for the tide carried me in the direction I would go. And so, with
a few minutes, I came safely under the vessel's side.

I heard voices on the deck above me, and though I could not catch what was said, I distinguished
Vetch's clear, high-pitched tones. Doubtless the crew were keeping a careful watch on the shore,
but very likely they had heard the crashing of my horse when he fell, and Vetch might be flattering
himself that the beast and I had shared the same fate and that he would set eyes on me no more.
I waited but long enough to be sure there was no uneasiness among the crew; then, with much
pains to avoid splashing, I crept close along by the hull until I found the fore cable.

When considering my plan on the shore, I had to decide which of the two cables to attempt first.
The vessel lay with her head to the sea. If I cut the cable over the stern, the tide running
in, the position of the brig would alter so slightly as not to be at once perceived, and I
might have time to deal with the other cable before anyone was aware of it. On the other hand,
supposing I were by some unlucky chance espied, the cutting of the second cable would be beyond
possibility, and no harm done. Whereas, if I began with the fore cable, the brig would swing
round immediately, and the movement could not escape the notice of the crew, however heedless,
and if they looked over the side they might spy me and so defeat my full purpose. Yet it seemed
that by adopting the latter course I could not fail utterly; with the fore rope cut the vessel
might drag the other anchor, so that, indeed, it might not be necessary to cut the second rope
at all. The risk to me was perhaps greater, but so would be the success; accordingly I had
decided to begin my work under the bow of the vessel.

Winding my legs about the part of the rope that was in the water, I began to saw gently with
my knife at the part above me, only my head and shoulders showing above the surface. The tide
and the sea breeze put some strain on the cable, but every now and again it slackened as the
bow sank with the long rocking of the vessel.

This set me thinking. If the rope snapped when it was taut, those on board would feel the spring
of it, and I should be without doubt discovered before I could sever the other: whereas, if
the severance was made when the rope was slack, there would be no shock, and the men would
be aware of nothing until the vessel swung round on the tide. I so timed my knife work, therefore,
that the last strand was cut through when the bow was dipping. The moment it was done I sank
down to the water level, and after waiting a moment to see in what direction the vessel would
swing, I went wholly under, and swam along in the opposite direction towards the stern, keeping
as close to the hull as was safe.

When I came up for breath, I heard a great uproar on board. The crew were flocking to the bows
to see what had happened to the anchor. Meanwhile with a few more strokes I reached the other
rope, and was hacking away at it steadily when I heard one cry out that the cable was cut,
and immediately afterwards the voice of Vetch as he rushed out of the roundhouse. I felt pretty
secure in the darkness under the stern sheets, but the strain upon the cable here was much
greater now that the other was gone, and when I cut it through the vessel gave a jump, I heard
oaths and a great scurry of feet on deck and some one let down a flare to discover the perpetrator
of the mischief.

You may be sure I dived under water as quickly as might be, but not before I was descried,
and my head had barely disappeared when a heavy object fell with a great splash within a few
inches of it. I swam along like a fish beneath the surface, making towards the shore; but when
for the sake of my lungs I had perforce to come up, a perfect fusillade spattered all around
me, and it seemed a miracle I was not hit. I swam on; the tide was bearing the vessel away
from me; the flare lit but a narrow space of water, and I doubt whether my head could now be
seen and made a target. Though I heard the muskets roaring and slugs plopping into the water,
not one of them touched me, and in a minute or two I gained the beach, pretty breathless, but
marvelously content.

And there is it have the psalm question by ours?
 "Man, ye've good blood in your veins, and
me having a good hand at the cutting, we'll verra soon have ye on your two feet again; and
the lassie will no like be fashed at that, I'm thinkin'."

"I am to thank you then for cutting out the bullet," I said, and then, remembering how I had
come by it, I cried: "Have they got that villain?"

"Meanin' Vetch?" says the man. "Hoots! Ye'll no catch him; he's a slithery man, yon. He was
up and awa' before he could be stoppit, with a wheen o' yelling niggers after him. Aweel, I'm
no that sorry mysel', for he wasna just what ye would call a gentleman."

I suppose that something of what I was thinking showed in my face, for the Scotchman continued:

"I had naething against him as an employer, ye ken; he was sound wi' the siller; but his dealin'
wi' sic a bonny lassie kind o' affrontit me, and I'm well enough pleased ye got the better
of him in that regard. I mind o' the time when I had a wee-bit lassie mysel'."

And then the besotted fellow began to weep, and comforted himself with a long pull from a flask
he took from his pocket. 'Twas plain that the drink had been his undoing, and indeed, before
I parted company with him in Port Royal some days later, he told me with maudlin tears the
story of his declension from surgeon on a king's ship to buccaneer, and preached me many an
impressive sermon on the text of the bottle.

Mistress Lucy had withdrawn while we were talking, and Sandy MacLeod, as he was named, dressed
my wound again with a hand as tender as a woman's. And then Joe Punchard came down to see me,
Cludde remaining on deck to keep an eye on the crew. Vetch had sprung overboard, and run fleetly
as a deer to the shore, and though the negroes on the cliff sped after him with yells, they
had a round of half a mile to go over rough ground, and could not catch him. I would fain have
him in my power, so that he might receive his desserts at the hands of a jury, and be deprived
at least of further opportunities of mischief, but my vexation at his escape was solaced by
the knowledge that Mistress Lucy's safety was secure.

I talked things over with Joe, and we decided to sail the brig round the coast to Port Royal,
and hand Mistress Lucy over to her friends in Spanish Town. The management of her estate gave
us some concern. It could not be left without a responsible head, and the overseers, being,
as I learned from her, men whom Vetch had put in when he dismissed McTavish and the other white
men whom he had found there on his arrival, were scarcely to be trusted.

As the result of a consultation with Mistress Lucy, she asked Cludde (who had begged and received
her forgiveness) to return to Penolver and take charge until we should have had time to reengage
McTavish and send him up from Spanish Town. Mistress Lucy being now of age, Vetch's brief authority
had come to an end, and I supposed that he would make his way to Dry Harbor and take ship to
England. I could imagine the rage of Sir Richard when his emissary should return and report
the total failure of his scheme. 'Twould sort with his violent and overbearing character to
make Vetch a scapegoat (a man in the wrong must ever have someone to kick); and I wondered
to what new villainy Cyrus would turn for his livelihood.

We had some trouble with the buccaneers when I told them they would be required to work the
brig to Port Royal. They felt a very natural reluctance to come within reach of the merchants
and shipmen who had suffered from their depredations. But I took it upon myself to promise
them good pay and immunity from arrest, provided they joined a king's ship forthwith, and being
seconded by Sandy MacLeod the surgeon, who had much influence with his comrades, I brought
them to acquiesce. And so, having bade farewell to Cludde and the friendly negroes, Uncle Moses
and Noah (Jacob would accompany me), we waited a few hours until the old nurse Patty had been
sent up from the house and then we unfurled our sails to a favoring wind, and in the course
of three days made the harbor of Port Royal.

During the voyage I saw almost nothing of Mistress Lucy. My wound kept me to my cabin; she
did not often stir from hers, and 'twas Patty who bestowed on me the ministrations that are
so pleasant to a sick man. I own I was somewhat disappointed in this matter. 'Twas nothing
that Mistress Lucy had not uttered a word of thanks to me for what I had done for her (she
was much more affable with Joe Punchard); her refraining spared me embarrassment, for a man
of my nature is ill at ease under any demonstration of gratitude; but there were many other
things we might have talked about, and the mere sight of her would have been a comfort. Opinion,', others.

After the fight had continued upwards of two hours, the Frenchmen drew off out of gunshot,
and we made what sail we could after them, but they used all possible shifts to evade fighting,
our men shouting after them derisively as cowardly curs. Darkness put a stop to the pursuit,
but again we hugged the enemy all night, hoping that next day would see the conclusion of this
long-drawn battle.

When the third morning dawned, we spied the enemy about a mile and a half ahead. Of our ships
the half-crippled Ruby was nearest, the Falmouth next; the rest were but indifferently near,
the Greenwich indeed lying full three leagues astern, though the admiral had never struck his
signal for battle night or day.

For many hours the wind blew easterly, but at three in the afternoon it shifted to the south
and gave the enemy the weather gauge. In tacking we fetched within gunshot of the sternmost
of them, and for half an hour or so we kept up a brisk bombardment; but our line was still
much out of order, and some of our ships being even now three miles astern, nothing more could
be done.

And so another day passed. The other vessels had not come within speaking distance of us, and
it seemed that all hope of bringing the enemy to a decisive engagement must be abandoned.

The dawn of the fourth morning found the Frenchmen six miles ahead, and one less in number,
for the great Dutch ship had separated from the squadron and was out of sight. The Defiance
and Windsor, ever the most dilatory of our vessels, were at this time four miles astern. About
ten o'clock, the wind then blowing east nor'-east, but very variable, the enemy tacked, and
the admiral fetched within range of two of them, giving them his broadside and receiving from
them many shrewd knocks. Then, tacking also, he pursued them with what speed he might, and
about noon contrived to cut off from their line a small English ship, the Ann galley, which
they had taken off Lisbon.

This small success cheered our drooping spirits a little; but a complete victory seemed further
off than ever, for the Ruby proved to be so disabled that the admiral ordered her to return
to Port Royal, so that we had five ships against the enemy's nine. During the day our vessels
drew somewhat closer to us, the Falmouth being the foremost, and we gained some four miles
upon the enemy by sunset.

Ever since we had first sighted the Frenchmen, Mr. Benbow had snatched but a few hours' sleep
each night, and was becoming worn out for want of rest and for bitter mortification at the
ill conduct of his captains. 'Tis true the enemy had shown no disposition to stand, and the
light winds had not favored the overhauling of them, and I was very sure that in the case of
Captain Vincent, at any rate, 'twas sheer ill luck that prevented him from giving the admiral
support. But I had other ideas of the behavior of the captains of the vessels that hung back
most. Captain Kirkby of the Defiance and Captain Wade of the Greenwich I knew to be of the
anti-Benbow party, and though I had not the same knowledge of Captain Constable of the Windsor
and Captain Hudson of the Pendennis, I suspected that they were infected by the same blight,
for I could not believe that officers of the English navy could be arrant cowards.

On the night of the twenty-fourth I had the middle watch. Towards two o'clock Joe Punchard
came to me, smoking a pipe, and looking more miserable than I had ever seen him.

"Twill break my captain's heart if we have another day of it," he says gloomily. "He looks
five years older than he did when we left Port Royal. He can't sleep, and if he do fall into
a doze he starts up like a child out of a bad dream. He swears he will court martial the captains,
every man jack of them, when we get to port, but that won't win us the battle, and he has set
his heart on giving the Frenchmen a drubbing. And he's took a notion that he'll never get through
alive, which is so uncommon unlike him, being mostly so cheery, that it gives me the dumps bad."

I was saying what I could to cheer the good fellow when the lookout cries he sees a sail ahead.
The admiral rushes out of his cabin and orders the drums to beat to quarters. In an instant,
as it seemed, the decks were full of men. 'Twas a clear night, with very little wind, and we
could see one of the French ships within hail of us. We gave her a tremendous broadside from
all three decks at once, with double shot, round below, and round and partridge aloft. She
returned it hotly, striking down many of our good fellows; I myself narrowly escaped one of
the shot, which hit a man at my side, carrying away his right arm clear from the shoulder.

We kept up the duel of firing for near an hour, and then I heard a great cry go up that the
admiral was wounded, and by and by Joe comes to me with tears streaming down his cheeks, and
says that the admiral's right leg was shattered to pieces by a chain shot, and he was carried
below. But while he was still talking to me we heard a great shout and there was Mr. Benbow
being hoisted in his cradle on to the quarterdeck, and crying out "Good cheer, my hearties!
The Frenchmen have given me a knock, but we've got 'em now and by God! we'll beat 'em!" 

"not see it was wanted to dispose, who had come by mr. But how can lead i want it is? And chamber

We lay becalmed for the rest of that day, but a light easterly breeze springing up towards
morning, we clapped on all sail and worked steadily along the coast. I examined the chart very
carefully for likely anchorages, and used my perspective glass constantly; but we saw no sign
of the pirate, nor indeed of any vessel, all that day.

Towards dusk we approached the entrance of the cove whence I had sailed the brig of which I
was now in command. We heaved to behind a headland about two miles to the east of it, out of
view of any vessel which might be in the cove or at the mouth, and waited for darkness. I had
no reason to suppose that the pirate lay within the cove, though 'twas likely enough; but it
behooved us to go as cautiously as if we knew she was there for certain. Considering her strength,
if it should come to a fight, 'twas clearly good tactics to choose my own time and manner of
attacking her.

About the end of the second dog watch I lowered a boat, and with Joe Punchard and half a dozen
picked men, together with the sailor we had rescued, set off with muffled oars up the cove
to reconnoiter, leaving Fincham in charge of the brig. "but to command," he state, "the female
