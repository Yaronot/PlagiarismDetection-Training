A man had appeared in Poland--such was the burden of Basmanov's story--coming none knew exactly
whence, who claimed to be Demetrius, the son of Ivan Vassielivitch, and lawful Tsar of Russia--Demetrius,
who was believed to have died at Uglich ten years ago, and whose remains lay buried in Moscow,
in the Church of St. Michael. This man had found shelter in Lithuania, in the house of Prince
Wisniowiecki, and thither the nobles of Poland were now flocking to do him homage, acknowledging
him the son of Ivan the Terrible. He was said to be the living image of the dead Tsar, save
that he was swarthy and black-haired, like the dowager Tsarina, and there were two warts on
his face, such as it was remembered had disfigured the countenance of the boy Demetrius.

Thus Basmanov, adding that he had dispatched a messenger into Lithuania to obtain more precise
confirmation of the story. That messenger--chosen in consequence of something else that Basmanov
had been told--was Smirnoy Otrepiev.

The Tsar Boris sat back in his chair, his eyes on the gem encrusted goblet, the stem of which
his fingers were mechanically turning. There was now no vestige of the smile on his round white
face. It had grown set and thoughtful.

"Find Prince Shuiski," he said presently, "and send him to me here."

Upon the tale the boyar had brought him he offered now no comment.

"We will talk of this again, Basmanov," was all he said in acknowledgment that he had heard,
and in dismissal.

But when the boyar had gone, Boris Godunov heaved himself to his feet, and strode over to the
fire, his great head sunk between his massive shoulders. He was a short, thick-set, bow-legged
man, inclining to corpulence. He set a foot, shod in red leather reversed with ermine, upon
an andiron, and, leaning an elbow on the carved overmantel, rested his brow against his hand.
His eyes stared into the very heart of the fire, as if they beheld there the pageant of the
past, upon which his mind was bent.

Nineteen years were sped since Ivan the Terrible had passed away, leaving two sons, Feodor
Ivanovitch, who had succeeded him, and the infant Demetrius. Feodor, a weakling who was almost
imbecile, had married Irene, the daughter of Boris Godunov, whereby it had fallen out that
Boris became the real ruler of Russia, the power behind the throne. But his insatiable ambition
coveted still more. He must wear the crown as well as wield the sceptre; and this could not
be until the Ruric dynasty which had ruled Russia for nearly seven centuries should be stamped
out. Between himself and the throne stood his daughter's husband and their child, and the boy
Demetrius, who had been dispatched with his mother, the dowager Tsarina, to Uglich. The three
must be removed.

Boris began with the last, and sought at first to drive him out of the succession without bloodshed.
He attempted to have him pronounced illegitimate, on the ground that he was the son of Ivan's
seventh wife (the orthodox Church recognizing no wife as legitimate beyond the third). But
in this he failed. The memory of the terrible Tsar, the fear of him, was still alive in superstitious
Russia, and none dared to dishonour his son. So Boris had recourse to other and surer means.
He dispatched his agents to Uglich, and presently there came thence a story that the boy, whilst
playing with a knife, had been taken with a fit of epilepsy, and had fallen, running the blade
into his throat. But it was not a story that could carry conviction to the Muscovites, since
with it came the news that the town of Uglich had risen against the emissaries of Boris, charging
them with the murder of the boy, and killing them out of hand.

Terrible had been the vengeance which Boris had exacted. Of the luckless inhabitants of the
town two hundred were put to death by his orders, and the rest sent into banishment beyond
the Ural Mountains, whilst the Tsarina Maria, Demetrius's mother, for having said that her
boy was murdered at the instigation of Boris, was packed off to a convent, and had remained
there ever since in close confinement.

That had been in 1591. The next to go was Feodor's infant son, and lastly--in 1598--Feodor
himself, succumbing to a mysterious illness, and leaving Boris a clear path to the throne.
But he ascended it under the burden of his daughter's curse. Feodor's widow had boldly faced
her father, boldly accused him of poisoning her husband to gratify his remorseless ambitions,
and on a passionate appeal to God to let it be done by him as he had done by others she had
departed to a convent, swearing never to set eyes upon him again.

The thought of her was with him now, as he stood there looking into the heart of the fire;
and perhaps it was the memory of her curse that turned his stout heart to water, and made him
afraid where there could surely be no cause for fear. For five years now had he been Tsar of
Russia, and in these five years he had taken such a grip of power as was not lightly to be
loosened.

Long he stood there, and there he was found by the magnificent Prince Shuiski, whom he had
bidden Basmanov to summon.

"You went to Uglich when the Tsarevitch Demetrius was slain," said Boris. His voice and mien
were calm and normal. "Yourself you saw the body. There is no possibility that you could have
been mistaken in it?"

"Mistaken?" The boyar was taken aback by the question. He was a tall man, considerably younger
than Boris, who was in his fiftieth year. His face was lean and saturnine, and there was something
sinister in the dark, close-set eyes under a single, heavy line of eyebrow.

Boris explained his question, telling him what he had learnt from Basmanov. Basil Shuiski laughed.
The story was an absurd one. Demetrius was dead. Himself he had held the body in his arms,
and no mistake was possible.

Despite himself, a sigh of relief fluttered from the lips of Boris. Shuiski was right. It was
an absurd story, this. There was nothing to fear. He had been a fool to have trembled for a moment.

Nevertheless, in the weeks that followed, he brooded more and more over all that Basmanov had
said. It was in the thought that the nobility of Poland was flocking to the house of Wisniowiecki
to do honour to this false son of Ivan the Terrible, that Boris found the chief cause of uneasiness.
There was famine in Moscow, and empty bellies do not make for loyalty. Then, too, the Muscovite
nobles did not love him. He had ruled too sternly, and had curbed their power. There were men
like Basil Shuiski who knew too much--greedy, ambitious men, who might turn their knowledge
to evil account. The moment might be propitious to the pretender, however false his claim.
Therefore Boris dispatched a messenger to Wisniowiecki with the offer of a heavy bribe if he
would yield up the person of this false Demetrius.

But that messenger returned empty-handed. He had reached Bragin too late. The pretender had
already left the place, and was safely lodged in the castle of George Mniszek, the Palatine
of Sandomir, to whose daughter Maryna he was betrothed. If these were ill tidings for Boris,
there were worse to follow soon. Within a few months he learned from Sandomir that Demetrius
had removed to Cracow, and that there he had been publicly acknowledged by Sigismund III. of
Poland as the son of Ivan Vassielivitch, the rightful heir to the crown of Russia. He heard,
too, the story upon which this belief was founded. Demetrius had declared that one of the agents
employed by Boris Godunov to procure his murder at Uglich had bribed his physician Simon to
perform the deed. Simon had pretended to agree as the only means of saving him. He had dressed
the son of a serf, who slightly resembled Demetrius, in garments similar to those worn by the
young prince, and thereafter cut the lad's throat, leaving those who had found the body to
presume it to be the prince's. Meanwhile, Demetrius himself had been concealed by the physician,
and very shortly thereafter carried away from Uglich, to be placed in safety in a monastery,
where he had been educated.

Such, in brief, was the story with which Demetrius convinced the court of Poland, and not a
few who had known the boy at Uglich came forward now to identify with him the grown man, who
carried in his face so strong a resemblance to Ivan the Terrible. That story which Boris now
heard was soon heard by all Russia, and Boris realized that something must be done to refute it.

But something more than assurances--his own assurances--were necessary if the Muscovites were
to believe him. And so at last Boris bethought him of the Tsarina Maria, the mother of the
murdered boy. He had her fetched to Moscow from her convent, and told her of this pretender
who was setting up a claim to the throne of Russia, supported by the King of Poland.

She listened impassively, standing before him in the black robes and conventual coif which
his tyranny had imposed upon her. When he had done, a faint smile swept over the face that
had grown so hard in these last twelve years since that day when her boy had been slain almost
under her very eyes.

"It is a circumstantial tale," she said. "It is perhaps true. It is probably true."

"True!" He bounded from his seat. "True? What are you saying, woman? Yourself you saw the boy
dead."

"I did, and I know who killed him."

"But you saw him. You recognized him for your own, since you set the people on to kill those
whom you believed had slain him."

"Yes," she answered. And added the question: "What do you want of me now?"

"What do I want?" He was amazed that she should ask, exasperated. Had the conventual confinement
turned her head? "I want your testimony. I want you to denounce this fellow for the impostor
that he is. The people will believe you."

"You think they will?" Interest had kindled in her glance.

"What else? Are you not the mother of Demetrius, and shall not a mother know her own son?"

"You forget. He was ten years of age then--a child. Now he is a grown man of three-and-twenty.
How can I be sure? How can I be sure of anything?"

He swore a full round oath at her. "Because you saw him dead."

"Yet I may have been mistaken. I thought I knew the agents of yours who killed him. Yet you
made me swear--as the price of my brothers' lives--that I was mistaken. Perhaps I was more
mistaken than we thought. Perhaps my little Demetrius was not slain at all. Perhaps this man's
tale is true."

"Perhaps..." He broke off to stare at her, mistrustfully, searchingly. "What do you mean?"
he asked her sharply.

Again that wan smile crossed the hard, sharp-featured face that once had been so lovely. "I
mean that if the devil came out of hell and called himself my son, I should acknowledge him
to your undoing."

Thus the pent-up hate and bitterness of years of brooding upon her wrongs broke forth. Taken
aback, he quailed before it. His jaw dropped foolishly, and he stared at her with wide, unblinking
eyes.

"The people will believe me, you say--they will believe that a mother should know her own son.
Then are your hours of usurpation numbered."

If for a moment it appalled him, yet in the end, forewarned, he was forearmed. It was foolish
of her to let him look upon the weapon with which she could destroy him. The result of it was
that she went back to her convent under close guard, and was thereafter confined with greater
rigour than hitherto.

Desperately Boris heard how the belief in Demetrius was gaining ground in Russia with the people.
The nobles might still be sceptical, but Boris knew that he could not trust them, since they
had no cause to love him. He began perhaps to realize that it is not good to rule by fear.

And then at last came Smirnoy Otrepiev back from Cracow, where he had been sent by Basmanov
to obtain with his own eyes confirmation of the rumour which had reached the boyar on the score
of the pretender's real identity.

The rumour, he declared, was right. The false Demetrius was none other than his own nephew,
Grishka Otrepiev, who had once been a monk, but, unfrocked, had embraced the Roman heresy,
and had abandoned himself to licentious ways. You realize now why Smirnoy had been chosen by
Basmanov for this particular mission.

The news heartened Boris. At last he could denounce the impostor in proper terms, and denounce
him he did. He sent an envoy to Sigismund III. to proclaim the fellow's true identity, and
to demand his expulsion from the Kingdom of Poland; and his denunciation was supported by a
solemn excommunication pronounced by the Patriarch of Moscow against the unfrocked monk, Grishka
Otrepiev, who now falsely called himself Demetrius Ivanovitch.

But the denunciation did not carry the conviction that Boris expected. It was reported that
the Tsarevitch was a courtly, accomplished man, speaking Polish and Latin, as well as Russian,
skilled in horsemanship and in the use of arms, and it was asked how an unfrocked monk had
come by these accomplishments. Moreover, although Boris, fore-warned, had prevented the Tsarina
Maria from supporting the pretender out of motives of revenge, he had forgotten her two brothers;
he had not foreseen that, actuated by the same motives, they might do that which he had prevented
her from doing. This was what occurred. The brothers Nagoy repaired to Cracow publicly to acknowledge
Demetrius their nephew, and to enrol themselves under his banner.

Against this Boris realized that mere words were useless. The sword of Nemesis was drawn indeed.
His sins had found him out. Nothing remained him but to arm and go forth to meet the impostor,
who was advancing upon Moscow with a great host of Poles and Cossacks.

He appraised the support of the Nagoys at its right value. They, too, had been at Uglich, and
had seen the dead boy, almost seen him slain. Vengeance upon himself was their sole motive.
But was it possible that Sigismund of Poland was really deceived, as well as the Palatine of
Sandomir, whose daughter was betrothed to the adventurer, Prince Adam Wisniowiecki, in whose
house the false Demetrius had first made his appearance, and all those Polish nobles who flocked
to his banner? Or were they, too, moved by some ulterior motive which he could not fathom?

That was the riddle that plagued Boris Godunov what time--in the winter of 1604--he sent his
armies to meet the invader. He sent them because, crippled now by gout, even the satisfaction
of leading them was denied him. He was forced to stay at home in the gloomy apartments of the
Kremlin, fretted by care, with the ghosts of his evil past to keep him company, and assure
him that the hour of judgment was at hand.

With deepening rage he heard how town after town capitulated to the adventurer, and mistrusting
Basmanov, who was in command, he sent Shuiski to replace him. In January of 1605 the armies
met at Dobrinichi, and Demetrius suffered a severe defeat, which compelled him to fall back
on Putioli. He lost all his infantry, and every Russian taken in arms on the pretender's side
was remorselessly hanged as Boris had directed.

Hope began to revive in the heart of Boris; but as months passed and no decision came, those
hopes faded again, and the canker of the past gnawed at his vitals and sapped his strength.
And then there was ever present to his mind the nightmare riddle of the pretender's identity.
At last, one evening in April, he sent for Smirnoy Otrepiev to question him again concerning
that nephew of his. Otrepiev came in fear this time. It is not good to be the uncle of a man
who is giving so much trouble to a great prince.

Boris glared at him from blood-injected eyes. His round, white face was haggard, his cheeks
sagged, and his fleshly body had lost all its erstwhile firm vigour.

"I have sent for you to question you again," he said, "touching this lewd nephew of yours,
this Grishka Otrepiev, this unfrocked monk, who claims to be Tsar of Muscovy. Are you sure,
man, that you have made no mistake--are you sure?"

Otrepiev was shaken by the Tsar's manner, by the ferocity of his mien. But he made answer:
"Alas, Highness! I could not be mistaken. I am sure."

Boris grunted, and moved his body irritably in his chair. His terrible eyes watched Otrepiev
mistrustfully. He had reached the mental stage in which he mistrusted everything and everybody.

"You lie, you dog," he snarled savagely.

"Highness, I swear..."

"Lies!" Boris roared him down. "And here's the proof. Would Sigismund of Poland have acknowledged
him had he been what you say? When I denounced him the unfrocked monk Grishka Otrepiev, would
not Sigismund have verified the statement had it been true?"

"The brothers Nagoy, the uncles of the dead Demetrius..." Otrepiev was beginning, when again
Boris interrupted him.

"Their acknowledgment of him came after Sigismund's, after--long after--my denunciation." He
broke into oaths. "I say you lie. Will you stand there and pelter with me, man? Will you wait
until the rack pulls you joint from joint before you speak the truth?"

"Highness!" cried Otrepiev, "I have served you faithfully these years."

"The truth, man; as you hope for life," thundered the Tsar, "the whole truth of this foul nephew
of yours, if so be he is your nephew."

And Otrepiev spoke the whole truth at last in his great dread. "He is not my nephew."

"Not?" It was a roar of rage. "You dared lie to me?"

Otrepiev's knees were loosened by terror, and he went down upon them before the irate Tsar.

"I did not lie--not altogether. I told you a half-truth, Highness. His name is Grishka Otrepiev;
it is the name by which he always has been known, and he is an unfrocked monk, all as I said,
and the son of my brother's wife."

"Then... then..." Boris was bewildered. Suddenly he understood. "And his father?"

"Was Stephen Bathory, King of Poland. Grishka Otrepiev is King Stephen's natural son."

Boris seemed to fight for breath for a moment.

"This is true?" he asked, and himself answered the question. "Of course it is true. It is the
light at last... at last. You may go."

Otrepiev stumbled out, thankful, surprised to escape so lightly. He could not know of how little
account to Boris was the deception he had practiced in comparison with the truth he had now
revealed, a truth that shed a fearful, dazzling light upon the dark mystery of the false Demetrius.
The problem that so long had plagued the Tsar was solved at last.

This pretended Demetrius, this unfrocked monk, was a natural son of Stephen Bathory, and a
Roman Catholic. Such men as Sigismund of Poland and the Voyvode of Sandomir were not deceived
on the score of his identity. They, and no doubt other of the leading nobles of Poland, knew
the man for what he was, and because of it supported him, using the fiction of his being Demetrius
Ivanovitch to impose upon the masses, and facilitate the pretenders occupation of the throne
of Russia. And the object of it was to set up in Muscovy a ruler who should be a Pole and a
Roman Catholic. Boris knew the bigotry of Sigismund, who already had sacrificed a throne--that
of Sweden--to his devout conscience, and he saw clearly to the heart of this intrigue. Had
he not heard that a Papal Nuncio had been at Cracow, and that this Nuncio had been a stout
supporter of the pretender's claim? What could be the Pope's concern in the Muscovite succession?
Why should a Roman priest support the claim of a prince to the throne of a country devoted
to the Greek faith?

At last all was clear indeed to Boris. Rome was at the bottom of this business, whose true
aim was the Romanization of Russia; and Sigismund had fetched Rome into it, had set Rome on.
Himself an elected King of Poland, Sigismund may have seen in the ambitious son of Stephen
Bathory one who might perhaps supplant him on the Polish throne. To divert his ambition into
another channel he had fathered--if he had not invented--this fiction that the pretender was
the dead Demetrius.

Had that fool Smirnoy Otrepiev but dealt frankly with him from the first, what months of annoyance
might he not have been spared; how easy it might have been to prick this bubble of imposture.
But better late than never. To-morrow he would publish the true facts, and all the world should
know the truth; and it was a truth that must give pause to those fools in this superstitious
Russia, so devoted to the Orthodox Greek Church, who favoured the pretender. They should see
the trap that was being baited for them.

There was a banquet in the Kremlin that night to certain foreign envoys, and Boris came to
table in better spirits than he had been for many a day. He was heartened by the thought of
what was now to do, by the conviction that he held the false Demetrius in the hollow of his
hand. There to those envoys he would announce to-night what to-morrow he would announce to
all Russia--tell them of the discovery he had made, and reveal to his subjects the peril in
which they stood. Towards the close of the banquet he rose to address his guests, announcing
that he had an important communication for them. In silence they waited for him to speak. And
then, abruptly, with no word yet spoken, he sank back into his chair, fighting for breath,
clawing the air, his face empurpling until suddenly the blood gushed copiously from his mouth
and nostrils.

He was vouchsafed time in which to strip off his splendid apparel and wrap himself in a monk's
robe, thus symbolizing the putting aside of earthly vanities, and then he expired.

It has been now and then suggested that he was poisoned. His death was certainly most opportune
to Demetrius. But there is nothing in the manner of it to justify the opinion that it resulted
from anything other than an apoplexy.

His death brought the sinister opportunist Shuiski back to Moscow to place Boris's son Feodor
on the throne. But the reign of this lad of sixteen was very brief. Basmanov, who had gone
back to the army, being now inspired by jealousy and fear of the ambitious Shuiski, went over
at once to the pretender, and proclaimed him Tsar of Russia. Thereafter events moved swiftly.
Basmanov marched on Moscow, entered it in triumph, and again proclaimed Demetrius, whereupon
the people rose in revolt against the son of the usurper Boris, stormed the Kremlin, and strangled
the boy and his mother.

Basil Shuiski would have shared their fate had he not bought his life at the price of betrayal.
Publicly he declared to the Muscovites that the boy whose body he had seen at Uglich was not
that of Demetrius, but of a peasant's son, who had been murdered in his stead.

That statement cleared the last obstacle from the pretender's path, and he advanced now to
take possession of his throne. Yet before he occupied it, he showed the real principles that
actuated him, proved how true had been Boris's conclusion. He ordered the arrest and degradation
of the Patriarch who had denounced and excommunicated him, and in his place appointed Ignatius,
Bishop of Riazan, a man suspected of belonging to the Roman communion.

On the 30th of June of that year 1605, Demetrius made his triumphal entry into Moscow. He went
to prostrate himself before the tomb of Ivan the Terrible, and then to visit the Tsarina Maria,
who, after a brief communion with him in private, came forth publicly to acknowledge him as
her son.

Just as Shuiski had purchased his life by a falsehood, so did she purchase her enlargement
from that convent where so long she had been a prisoner, and restoration to the rank that was
her proper due. After all, she had cause for gratitude to Demetrius, who, in addition to restoring
her these things, had avenged her upon the hated Boris Godunov.

His coronation followed in due season, and at last this amazing adventurer found himself firmly
seated upon the throne of Russia, with Basmanov at his right hand to help and guide him. And
at first all went well, and the young Tsar earned a certain measure of popularity. If his swarthy
face was coarse-featured, yet his bearing was so courtly and gracious that he won his way quickly
to the hearts of his people. For the rest he was of a tall, graceful figure, a fine horseman,
and of a knightly address at arms.

But he soon found himself in the impossible position of having to serve two masters. On the
one hand there was Russia, and the orthodox Russians whose tsar he was, and on the other there
were the Poles, who had made him so at a price, and who now demanded payment. Because he saw
that this payment would be difficult and fraught with peril to himself he would--after the
common wont of princes who have attained their objects--have repudiated the debt. And so he
was disposed to ignore, or at least to evade, the persistent reminders that reached him from
the Papal Nuncio, to whom he had promised the introduction into Russia of the Roman faith.

But presently came a letter from Sigismund couched in different terms. The King of Poland wrote
to Demetrius that word had reached him that Boris Godunov was still alive, and that he had
taken refuge in England, adding that he might be tempted to restore the fugitive to the throne
of Muscovy.

The threat contained in that bitter piece of sarcasm aroused Demetrius to a sense of the responsibilities
he had undertaken, which were precisely as Boris Godunov had surmised. As a beginning he granted
the Jesuits permission to build a church within the sacred walls of the Kremlin, whereby he
gave great scandal. Soon followed other signs that he was not a true son of the Orthodox Greek
Church; he gave offence by his indifference to public worship, by his neglect of Russian customs,
and by surrounding himself with Roman Catholic Poles, upon whom he conferred high offices and
dignities.

And there were those at hand ready to stir up public feeling against him, resentful boyars
quick to suspect that perhaps they had been swindled. Foremost among these was the sinister
turncoat Shuiski, who had not derived from his perjury all the profit he expected, who resented,
above all, to see Basmanov--who had ever been his rival--invested with a power second only
to that of the Tsar himself. Shuiski, skilled in intrigue, went to work in his underground,
burrowing fashion. He wrought upon the clergy, who in their turn wrought upon the populace,
and presently all was seething disaffection under a surface apparently calm.

The eruption came in the following May, when Maryna, the daughter of the Palatine of Sandomir,
made her splendid entry into Moscow, the bride-elect of the young Tsar. The dazzling procession
and the feasting that followed found little favour in the eyes of the Muscovites, who now beheld
their city aswarm with heretic Poles.

The marriage was magnificently solemnized on the 18th of May, 1606. And now Shuiski applied
a match to the train he had so skilfully laid. Demetrius had caused a timber fort to be built
before the walls of Moscow for a martial spectacle which he had planned for the entertainment
of his bride. Shuiski put it abroad that the fort was intended to serve as an engine of destruction,
and that the martial spectacle was a pretence, the real object being that from the fort the
Poles were to cast firebrands into the city, and then proceed to the slaughter of the inhabitants.

No more was necessary to infuriate an already exasperated populace. They flew to arms, and
on the night of the 29th of May they stormed the Kremlin, led on by the arch-traitor Shuiski
himself, to the cry of "Death to the heretic! Death to the impostor!"

They broke into the palace, and swarmed up the stairs into the Tsar's bedchamber, slaying the
faithful Basmanov, who stood sword in hand to bar the way and give his master time to escape.
The Tsar leapt from a balcony thirty feet to the ground, broke his leg, and lay there helpless,
to be dispatched by his enemies, who presently discovered him.

He died firmly and fearlessly protesting that he was Demetrius Ivanovitch. Nevertheless, he
was Grishka Otrepiev, the unfrocked monk.

It has been said that he was no more than an instrument in the hands of priestcraft, and that
because he played his part badly he met his doom. But something more he was. He was an instrument
indeed, not of priestcraft, but of Fate, to bring home to Boris Godunov the hideous sins that
stained his soul, and to avenge his victims by personating one of them. In that personation
he had haunted Boris as effectively as if he had been the very ghost of the boy murdered at
Uglich, haunted and tortured, and finally broken him so that he died.

That was the part assigned him by Fate in the mysterious scheme of human things. And that part
being played, the rest mattered little. In the nature of him and of his position it was impossible
that his imposture should be other than ephemeral.

III. THE HERMOSA FEMBRA

An Episode of the Inquisition in Seville

Apprehension hung like a thundercloud over the city of Seville in those early days of the year
1481. It had been growing since the previous October, when the Cardinal of Spain and Frey Tomas
de Torquemada, acting jointly on behalf of the Sovereigns--Ferdinand and Isabella--had appointed
the first inquisitors for Castile, ordering them to set up a Tribunal of the Faith in Seville,
to deal with the apostatizing said to be rampant among the New-Christians, or baptized Jews,
who made up so large a proportion of the population.

Among the many oppressive Spanish enactments against the Children of Israel, it was prescribed
that all should wear the distinguishing circlet of red cloth on the shoulder of their gabardines;
that they should reside within the walled confines of their ghettos and never be found beyond
them after nightfall, and that they should not practice as doctors, surgeons, apothecaries,
or innkeepers. The desire to emancipate themselves from these and other restrictions upon their
commerce with Christians and from the generally intolerable conditions of bondage and ignominy
imposed upon them, had driven many to accept baptism and embrace Christianity.

But even such New-Christians as were sincere in their professions of faith failed to find in
this baptism the peace they sought. Bitter racial hostility, though sometimes tempered, was
never extinguished by their conversion.

Hence the alarm with which they viewed the gloomy, funereal, sinister pageant--the white-robed,
black-mantled and hooded inquisitors, with their attendant familiars and barefoot friars--headed
by a Dominican bearing the white Cross, which invaded the city of Seville one day towards the
end of December and took its way to the Convent of St. Paul, there to establish the Holy Office
of the Inquisition. The fear of the New-Christians that they were to be the object of the attentions
of this dread tribunal had sufficed to drive some thousands of them out of the city, to seek
refuge in such feudal lordships as those of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Marquis of Cadiz,
and the Count of Arcos.

This exodus had led to the publication by the newly appointed inquisitors of the edict of 2nd
January, in which they set forth that inasmuch as it had come to their knowledge that many
persons had departed out of Seville in fear of prosecution upon grounds of heretical pravity,
they commanded the nobles of the Kingdom of Castile that within fifteen days they should make
an exact return of the persons of both sexes who had sought refuge in their lordships or jurisdictions;
that they arrest all these and lodge them in the prison of the Inquisition in Seville, confiscating
their property, and holding it at the disposal of the inquisitors; that none should shelter
any fugitive under pain of greater excommunication and of other penalties by law established
against abettors of heretics.

The harsh injustice that lay in this call to arrest men and women merely because they had departed
from Seville before departure was in any way forbidden, revealed the severity with which the
inquisitors intended to proceed. It completed the consternation of the New-Christians who had
remained behind, and how numerous these were may be gathered from the fact that in the district
of Seville alone they numbered a hundred thousand, many of them occupying, thanks to the industry
and talent characteristic of their race, positions of great eminence. It even disquieted the
well-favoured young Don Rodrigo de Cardona, who in all his vain, empty, pampered and rather
vicious life had never yet known perturbation. Not that he was a New-Christian. He was of a
lineage that went back to the Visigoths, of purest red Castilian blood, untainted by any strain
of that dark-hued, unclean fluid alleged to flow in Hebrew veins. But it happened that he was
in love with the daughter of the millionaire Diego de Susan, a girl whose beauty was so extraordinary
that she was known throughout Seville and for many a mile around as la Hermosa Fembra; and
he knew that such commerce--licit or illicitly conducted--was disapproved by the holy fathers.
His relations with the girl had been perforce clandestine, because the disapproval of the holy
fathers was matched in thoroughness by that of Diego de Susan. It had been vexatious enough
on that account not to be able to boast himself the favoured of the beautiful and opulent Isabella
de Susan; it was exasperating to discover now a new and more imperative reason for this odious
secrecy.

Never sped a lover to his mistress in a frame of mind more aggrieved than that which afflicted
Don Rodrigo as, tight-wrapped in his black cloak, he gained the Calle de Ataud on that January
night.

Anon, however, when by way of a garden gate and an easily escaladed balcony he found himself
in the presence of Isabella, the delight of her effaced all other considerations. Her father
was from home, as she had told him in the note that summoned him; he was away at Palacios on
some merchant's errand, and would not return until the morrow. The servants were all abed,
and so Don Rodrigo might put off his cloak and hat, and lounge at his ease upon the low Moorish
divan, what time she waited upon him with a Saracen goblet filled with sweet wine of Malaga.
The room in which she received him was one set apart for her own use, her bower, a long, low
ceilinged chamber, furnished with luxury and taste. The walls were hung with tapestries, the
floor spread with costly Eastern rugs; on an inlaid Moorish table a tall, three-beaked lamp
of beaten copper charged with aromatic oil shed light and perfume through the apartment.

Don Rodrigo sipped his wine, and his dark, hungry eyes followed her as she moved about him
with vaguely voluptuous, almost feline grace. The wine, the heavy perfume of the lamp, and
the beauty of her played havoc among them with his senses, so that he forgot for the moment
his Castilian lineage and clean Christian blood, forgot that she derived from the accursed
race of the Crucifiers. All that he remembered was that she was the loveliest woman in Seville,
daughter to the wealthiest man, and in that hour of weakness he decided to convert into reality
that which had hitherto been no more than an infamous presence. He would loyally fulfil the
false, disloyal promises he had made. He would take her to wife. It was a sacrifice which her
beauty and her wealth should make worth while. Upon that impulse he spoke now, abruptly:

"Isabella, when will you marry me?"

She stood before him, looking down into his weak, handsome face, her fingers interlacing his
own. She merely smiled. The question did not greatly move her. Not knowing him for the scoundrel
that he was, guessing nothing of the present perturbation of his senses, she found it very
natural that he should ask her to appoint the day.

"It is a question you must ask my father," she answered him.

"I will," said he, "to-morrow, on his return." And he drew her down beside him.

But that father was nearer than either of them dreamed. At that very moment the soft thud of
the closing housedoor sounded through the house. It brought her sharply to her feet, and loose
from his coiling arms, with quickened breath and blanching face. A moment she hung there, tense,
then sped to the door of the room, set it ajar and listened.

Up the stairs came the sound of footsteps and of muttering voices. It was her father, and others
with him.

With ever-mounting fear she turned to Don Rodrigo, and breathed the question: "If they should
come here?"

The Castilian stood where he had risen by the divan, his face paler now than its pale, aristocratic
wont, his eyes reflecting the fear that glittered in her own. He had no delusion as to what
action Diego de Susan would take upon discovering him. These Jewish dogs were quickly stirred
to passion, and as jealous as their betters of the honour of their womenfolk. Already Don Rodrigo
in imagination saw his clean red Christian blood bespattering that Hebrew floor, for he had
no weapon save the heavy Toledo dagger at his girdle, and Diego de Susan was not alone.

It was, he felt, a ridiculous position for a Hidalgo of Spain. But his dignity was to suffer
still greater damage. In another moment she had bundled him into an alcove behind the arras
at the chamber's end, a tiny closet that was no better than a cupboard contrived for the storing
of household linen. She had-moved with a swift precision which at another time might have provoked
his admiration, snatching up his cloak and hat, and other evidences of his presence, quenching
the lamp, and dragging him to that place of cramped concealment, which she remained to share
with him.

Came presently movements in the room beyond, and the voice of her father:

"We shall be securest from intrusion here. It is my daughter's room. If you will give me leave,
I will go down again to admit our other friends."

Those other friends, as Don Rodrigo gathered, continued to arrive for the next half-hour, until
in the end there must have been some twenty of them assembled in that chamber. The mutter of
voices had steadily increased, but so confused that no more than odd words, affording no clue
to the reason of this gathering, had reached the hidden couple.

And then quite suddenly a silence fell, and on that silence beat the sharp, clear voice of
Diego de Susan addressing them.

"My friends," he said, "I have called you hither that we may concert measures for the protection
of ourselves and all New-Christians in Seville from the fresh peril by which we are menaced.
The edict of the inquisitors reveals how much we have to fear. You may gather from it that
the court of the Holy Office is hardly likely to deal in justice, and that the most innocent
may find himself at any moment exposed to its cruel mercies. Therefore it is for us now to
consider how to protect ourselves and our property from the unscrupulous activities of this
tribunal. You are the principal New Christian citizens of Seville; you are wealthy, not only
in property, but also in the goodwill of the people, who trust and respect, and at need will
follow, you. If nothing less will serve, we must have recourse to arms; and so that we are
resolute and united, my friends, we shall prevail against the inquisitors."

Within the alcove, Don Rodrigo felt his skin roughening with horror at this speech, which breathed
sedition not only against the Sovereigns, but against the very Church. And with his horror
was blent a certain increase of fear. If his situation had been perilous before, it was tenfold
more dangerous now. Discovery, since he had overheard this treason, must mean his certain death.
And Isabella, realizing the same to the exclusion of all else, clutched his arm and cowered
against him in the dark.

There was worse to follow. Susan's address was received with a murmur of applause, and then
others spoke, and several were named, and their presence thus disclosed. There was the influential
Manuel Sauli, who next to Susan was the wealthiest man in Seville; there was Torralba, the
Governor of Triana; Juan Abolafio, the farmer of the royal customs, and his brother Fernandez,
the licentiate, and there were others--all of them men of substance, some even holding office
under the Crown. Not one was there who dissented from anything that Susan had said; rather
did each contribute some spur to the general resolve. In the end it was concerted that each
of those present should engage himself to raise a proportion of the men, arms and money that
would be needed for their enterprise. And upon that the meeting was dissolved, and they departed.
Susan himself went with them. He had work to do in the common cause, he announced, and he would
do it that very night in which it was supposed that he was absent at Palacios.

At last, when all had gone, and the house was still again, Isabella and her lover crept forth
from their concealment, and in the light of the lamp which Susan had left burning each looked
into the other's white, startled face. So shaken was Don Rodrigo with horror of what he had
overheard, and with the terror of discovery, that it was with difficulty he kept his teeth
from chattering.

"Heaven protect us!" he gasped. "What Judaizing was this?"

"Judaizing!" she echoed. It was the term applied to apostacy, to the relapse of New-Christians
to Judaism, an offense to be expiated at the stake. "Here was no Judaizing. Are you mad, Rodrigo?
You heard no single word that sinned against the Faith."

"Did I not? I heard treason enough to."

"No, nor treason either. You heard honourable, upright men considering measures of defence
against oppression, injustice, and evil acquisitiveness masquerading in the holy garments of
religion."

He stared askance at her for a moment, then his full lips curled into a sneer. "Of course you
would seek to justify them," he said. "You are of that foul brood yourself. But you cannot
think to cozen me, who am of clean Old-christian blood and a true son of Mother Church. These
men plot evil against the Holy Inquisition. Is that not Judaizing when it is done by Jews?"

She was white to the lips, and a new horror stared at him from her great dark eyes; her lovely
bosom rose and fell in tumult. Yet still she sought to reason with him.

"They are not Jews--not one of them. Why, Perez is himself in holy orders. All of them are
Christians, and..."

"Newly-baptized!" he broke in, sneering viciously. "A defilement of that holy sacrament to
gain them worldly advantages. That is revealed by what passed here just now. Jews they were
born, the sons of Jews, and Jews they remain under their cloak of mock Christianity, to be
damned as Jews in the end." He was panting now with fiery indignation; a holy zeal inflamed
this profligate defiler. "God forgive me that ever I entered here. Yet I do believe that it
was His will that I should come to overhear what is being plotted. Let me depart from hence."

With a passionate gesture of abhorrence he swung towards the door. Her clutch upon his arm
arrested him.

"Whither do you go?" she asked trim sharply. He looked now into her eyes, and of all that they
contained he saw only fear; he saw nothing of the hatred into which her love had been transmuted
in that moment by his unsparing insults to herself, her race and her home, by the purpose which
she clearly read in him.

"Whither?" he echoed, and sought to shake her off.

"Whither my Christian duty bids me."

It was enough for her. Before he could prevent or suspect her purpose, she had snatched the
heavy Toledo blade from his girdle, and armed with it stood between the door and him.

"A moment, Don Rodrigo. Do not attempt to advance, or, as Heaven watches us, I strike, and
it maybe that I shall kill you. We must talk awhile before you go."

Amazed, chapfallen, half-palsied, he stood before her, his fine religious zeal wiped out by
fear of that knife in her weak woman's hand. Rapidly to-night was she coming into real knowledge
of this Castilian gentleman, whom with pride she had taken for her lover. It was a knowledge
that was to sear her presently with self-loathing and self-contempt. But for the moment her
only consideration was that, as a direct result of her own wantonness, her father stood in
mortal peril. If he should perish through the deletion of this creature, she would account
herself his slayer.

"You have not considered that the deletion you intend will destroy my father," she said quietly.

"There is my Christian duty to consider," answered he, but without boldness now.

"Perhaps. But there is something you must set against it. Have you no duty as a lover--no duty
to me?"

"No earthly duty can weigh against a spiritual obligation...."

"Ah, wait! Have patience. You have not well considered, that is plain. In coming here in secret
you wronged my father. You will not trouble to deny it.

"Jointly we wronged him, you and I. Will you then take advantage of something learnt whilst
you were hiding there like a thief from the consequences of what you did, and so do him yet
this further wrong?"

"Must I wrong my conscience?" he asked her sullenly.

"Indeed, I fear you must."

"Imperil my immortal soul?" He almost laughed.

"You talk in vain."

"But I have something more than words for you." With her left hand she drew upon the fine gold
chain about her neck, and brought forth a tiny jewelled cross. Passing the chain over her head,
she held it out.

"Take this," she bade him. "Take it, I say. Now, with that sacred symbol in your hand, make
solemn oath to divulge no word of what you have learnt here tonight, or else resign yourself
to an unshriven death. For either you take that oath, or I rouse the servants and have you
dealt with as one who has intruded here unbidden for an evil end." She backed away from him
as she spoke, and threw wide the door. Then, confronting him from the threshold, she admonished
him again, her voice no louder than a whisper. "Quick now! Resolve yourself. Will you die here
with all your sins upon you, and so destroy for all eternity the immortal soul that urges you
to this betrayal, or will you take the oath that I require?"

He began an argument that was like a sermon of the Faith. But she cut him short. "For the last
time!" she bade him. "Will you decide?"

He chose the coward's part, of course, and did violence tomb fine conscience. With the cross
in his hand he repeated after her the words of the formidable oath that she administered an
oath which it must damn his immortal soul to break. Because of that, because she imagined that
she had taken the measure of his faith, she returned him his dagger, and let him go at last.
She imagined that she had bound him fast in irrefragable spiritual bonds.

And even on the morrow, when her father and all those who had been present at that meeting
at Susan's house were arrested by order of the Holy Office of the Inquisition, she still clung
to that belief. Yet presently a doubt crept in, a doubt that she must at all costs resolve.
And so presently she called for her litter, and had herself carried to the Convent of St. Paul,
where she asked to see Frey Alonso de Ojeda, the Prior of the Dominicans of Seville.

She was left to wait in a square, cheerless, dimly-lighted room pervaded by a musty smell,
that had for only furniture a couple of chairs and a praying-stool, and for only ornament a
great, gaunt crucifix hanging upon one of its whitewashed walls.

Thither came presently two Dominican friars. One of these was a harsh-featured man of middle
height and square build, the uncompromising zealot Ojeda. The other was tall and lean, stooping
slightly at the shoulders, haggard and pale of countenance, with deep-set, luminous dark eyes,
and a tender, wistful mouth. This was the Queen's confessor, Frey Tomas de Torquemada, Grand
Inquisitor of Castile. He approached her, leaving Ojeda in the background, and stood a moment
regarding her with eyes of infinite kindliness and compassion.

"You are the daughter of that misguided man, Diego de Susan," he said, in a gentle voice. "God
help and strengthen you, my child, against the trials that may be in store for you. What do
you seek at our poor hands? Speak, child, without fear."

"Father," she faltered, "I come to implore your pity."

"No need to implore it, child. Should I withhold pity who stand myself in need of pity, being
a sinner--as are we all."

"It is for my father that I come to beg your mercy."

"So I supposed." A shade crossed the gentle, wistful face; the tender melancholy deepened in
the eyes that regarded her. "If your father is innocent of what has been alleged against him,
the benign tribunal of the Holy Office will bring his innocence to light, and rejoice therein;
if he is guilty, if he has strayed--as we may all stray unless fortified by heavenly grace--he
shall be given the means of expiation, that his salvation may be assured him."

She shivered at the words. She knew the mercy in which the inquisitors dealt, a mercy so spiritual
that it took no account of the temporal agonies inflicted to ensure it.

"My father is innocent of any sin against the Faith," said she.

"Are you so sure?" croaked the harsh voice of Ojeda, breaking in. "Consider well. Remember
that your duty as a Christian is above your duty as a daughter."

Almost had she bluntly demanded the name of her father's accuser, that thus she might reach
the object of her visit. Betimes she checked the rash impulse, perceiving that subtlety was
here required; that a direct question would close the door to all information. Skilfully, then,
she chose her line of attack.

"I am sure," she exclaimed, "that he is a more fervent and pious Christian--New-Christian though
he be--than his accuser."

The wistfulness faded from Torquemada's eyes. They grew keen, as became the eyes of an inquisitor,
the eyes of a sleuth, quick to fasten on a spoor. But he shook his head.

Ojeda advanced. "That I cannot believe," said he. "The deletion was made from a sense of duty
so pure that the delator did not hesitate to confess the sin of his own commission through
which he had discovered the treachery of Don Diego and his associates."

She could have cried out in anguish at this answer to her unspoken question. Yet she controlled
herself, and that no single doubt should linger, she thrust boldly home.

"He confessed it?" she cried, seemingly aghast. The friar slowly nodded. "Don Rodrigo confessed?"
she insisted, as will the incredulous.

Abruptly the friar nodded again; and as abruptly checked, recollecting himself.

"Don Rodrigo?" he echoed, and asked: "Who mentioned Don Rodrigo?"

But it was too late. His assenting nod had betrayed the truth, had confirmed her worst fear.
She swayed a little; the room swam round her, she felt as she would swoon. Then blind indignation
against that forsworn betrayer surged to revive her. If it was through her weakness and undutifulness
that her father had been destroyed, through her strength should he be avenged, though in doing
so she pulled down and destroyed herself.

"And he confessed to his own sin?" she was repeating slowly, ever on that musing, incredulous
note. "He dared confess himself a Judaizer?"

"A Judaizer!" Sheer horror now overspread the friar's grim countenance. "A Judaizer! Don Rodrigo?
Oh, impossible!"

"But I thought you said he had confessed."

"Why, yes, but... but not to that." Her pale lips smiled, sadly contemptuous.

"I see. He set limits of prudence upon his confession. He left out his Judatting practices.
He did not tell you, for instance, that this deletion was an act of revenge against me who
refused to marry him, having discovered his unfaith, and fearing its consequences in this world
and the next."

Ojeda stared at her in sheer, incredulous amazement.

And then Torquemada spoke: "Do you say that Don Rodrigo de Cardona is a Judaizer? Oh, it is
unbelievable."

"Yet I could give you evidence that should convince you."

"Then so you shall. It is your sacred duty, lest you become an abettor of heresy, and yourself
liable to the extreme penalty."

It would be a half-hour later, perhaps, when she quitted the Convent of St. Paul to return
home, with Hell in her heart, knowing in life no purpose but that of avenging the parent her
folly had destroyed. As she was being carried past the Alcazar, she espied across the open
space a tall, slim figure in black, in whom she recognized her lover, and straightway she sent
the page who paced beside her litter to call him to her side. The summons surprised him after
what had passed between them; moreover, considering her father's present condition, he was
reluctant to be seen in attendance upon the beautiful, wealthy Isabella de Susan. Nevertheless,
urged on by curiosity, he went.

Her greeting increased his surprise.

"I am in deep distress, Rodrigo, as you may judge," she told him sadly. "You will have heard
what has befallen my father?"

He looked at her sharply, yet saw nothing but loveliness rendered more appealing by sorrow.
Clearly she did not suspect him of betrayal; did not realize that an oath extorted by violence--and
an oath, moreover, to be false to a sacred duty--could not be accounted binding.

"I... I heard of it an hour ago," he lied a thought unsteadily. "I... I commiserate you deeply."

"I deserve commiseration," answered she, "and so does my poor father, and those others. It
is plain that amongst those he trusted there was a traitor, a spy, who went straight from that
meeting to inform against them. If I but had a list it were easy to discover the betrayer.
One need but ascertain who is the one of all who were present whose arrest has been omitted."
Her lovely sorrowful eyes turned full upon him. "What is to become of me now, alone in the
world?" she asked him. "My father was my only friend."

The subtle appeal of her did its work swiftly. Besides, he saw here a noble opportunity worth
surely some little risk.

"Your only friend?" he asked her thickly. "Was there no one else? Is there no one else, Isabella?"

"There was," she said, and sighed heavily. "But after what befell last night, when... You know
what is in my mind. I was distraught then, mad with fear for this poor father of mine, so that
I could not even consider his sin in its full heinousness, nor see how righteous was your intent
to inform against him. Yet I am thankful that it was not by your deletion that he was taken.
The thought of that is to-day my only consolation."

They had reached her house by now. Don Rodrigo put forth his arm to assist her to alight from
her litter, and begged leave to accompany her within. But she denied him.

"Not now--though I am grateful to you, Rodrigo. Soon, if you will come and comfort me, you
may. I will send you word when I am more able to receive you--that is, if I am forgiven for..."

"Not another word," he begged her. "I honour you for what you did. It is I who should sue to
you for forgiveness."

"You are very noble and generous, Don Rodrigo. God keep you!" And so she left him.

She had found him--had she but known it--a dejected, miserable man in the act of reckoning
up all that he had lost. In betraying Susan he had acted upon an impulse that sprang partly
from rage, and partly from a sense of religious duty. In counting later the cost to himself,
he cursed the folly of his rage, and began to wonder if such strict observance of religious
duty was really worth while to a man who had his way to make in the world. In short, he was
in the throes of reaction. But now, in her unsuspicion, he found his hopes revive. She need
never know. The Holy Office preserved inviolate secrecy on the score of deletions--since to
do otherwise might be to discourage delators--and there were no confrontations of accuser and
accused, such as took place in temporal courts. Don Rodrigo left the Calle de Ataud better
pleased with the world than he had been since morning.

On the morrow he went openly to visit her; but he was denied, a servant announcing her indisposed.
This fretted him, damped his hopes, and thereby increased his longing. But on the next day
he received from her a letter which made him the most ample amends:

"Rodrigo,--There is a matter on which we must come early to an understanding. Should my poor
father be convicted of heresy and sentenced, it follows that his property will be confiscated,
since as the daughter of a convicted heretic I may not inherit. For myself I care little; but
I am concerned for you, Rodrigo, since if in spite of what has happened you would still wish
to make me your wife, as you declared on Monday, it would be my wish to come to you well cowered.
Now the inheritance which would be confiscated by the Holy Office from the daughter of a heretic
might not be so confiscated from the wife of a gentleman of Castile. I say no more. Consider
this well, and decide as your heart dictates. I shall receive you to-morrow if you come to me.

"Isabella."

She bade him consider well. But the matter really needed little consideration. Diego de Susan
was sure to go to the fire. His fortune was estimated at ten million maravedis. That fortune,
it seemed, Rodrigo was given the chance to make his own by marrying the beautiful Isabella
at once, before sentence came to be passed upon her father. The Holy Office might impose a
fine, but would not go further where the inheritance of a Castilian nobleman of clean lineage
was concerned. He was swayed between admiration of her shrewdness and amazement at his own
good fortune. Also his vanity was immensely flattered.

He sent her three lines to protest his undying love, and his resolve to marry her upon the
morrow, and went next day in person, as she had bidden him, to carry out the resolve.

She received him in the mansion's best room, a noble chamber furnished with a richness such
as no other house in Seville could have boasted. She had arrayed herself for the interview
with an almost wanton cunning that should enhance her natural endowments. Her high-waisted
gown, low-cut and close-fitting in the bodice, was of cloth of gold, edged with miniver at
skirt and cuffs and neck. On her white bosom hung a priceless carcanet of limpid diamonds,
and through the heavy tresses of her bronze-coloured hair was coiled a string of lustrous pearls.
Never had Don Rodrigo found her more desirable; never had he felt so secure and glad in his
possession of her. The quickening blood flushing now his olive face, he gathered her slim shapeliness
into his arms, kissing her cheek, her lips, her neck.

"My pearl, my beautiful, my wife!" he murmured, rapturously. Then added the impatient question:
"The priest? Where is the priest that shall make us one?"

Deep, unfathomable eyes looked up to meet his burning glance. Languorously she lay against
his breast, and her red lips parted in a smile that maddened him.

"You love me, Rodrigo--in spite of all?"

"Love you!" It was a throbbing, strangled cry, an almost inarticulate ejaculation. "Better
than life--better than salvation."

She fetched a sigh, as of deep content, and nestled closer. "Oh, I am glad--so glad--that your
love for me is truly strong. I am about to put it to the test, perhaps."

He held her very close. "What is this test, beloved?"

"It is that I want this marriage knot so tied that it shall be indissoluble save by death."

"Why, so do I," quoth he, who had so much to gain.

"And, therefore, because after all, though I profess Christianity, there is Jewish blood in
my veins, I would have a marriage that must satisfy even my father when he regains his freedom,
as I believe he will--for, after all, he is not charged with any sin against the faith."

She paused, and he was conscious of a premonitory chill upon his ardour.

"What do you mean?" he asked her, and his voice was strained.

"I mean--you'll not be angry with me?--I mean that I would have us married not only by a Christian
priest, and in the Christian manner, but also and first of all by a Rabbi, and in accordance
with the Jewish rites."

Upon the words, she felt his encircling arms turn limp, and relax their grip upon her, whereupon
she clung to him the more tightly.

"Rodrigo! Rodrigo! If you truly love me, if you truly want me, you'll not deny me this condition,
for I swear to you that once I am your wife you shall never hear anything again to remind you
that I am of Jewish blood."

His face turned ghastly pale, his lips writhed and twitched, and beads of sweat stood out upon
his brow.

"My God!" he groaned. "What do you ask? I... I can't. It were a desecration, a defilement."

She thrust him from her in a passion. "You regard it so? You protest love, and in the very
hour when I propose to sacrifice all to you, you will not make this little sacrifice for my
sake, you even insult the faith that was my forbears', if it is not wholly mine. I misjudged
you, else I had not bidden you here to-day. I think you had better leave me."

Trembling, appalled, a prey to an ineffable tangle of emotion, he sought to plead, to extenuate
his attitude, to move her from her own. He ranted torrentially, but in vain. She stood as cold
and aloof as earlier she had been warm and clinging. He had proved the measure of his love.
He could go his ways.

The thing she proposed was to him, as he had truly said, a desecration, a defilement. Yet to
have dreamed yourself master of ten million maravedis, and a matchless woman, is a dream not
easily relinquished. There was enough cupidity in his nature, enough neediness in his condition,
to make the realization of that dream worth the defilement of the abominable marriage rites
upon which she insisted. But fear remained where Christian scruples were already half-effaced.

"You do not realize," he cried. "If it were known that I so much as contemplated this, the
Holy Office would account it clear proof of apostasy, and send me to the fire."

"If that were your only objection it were easily overcome," she informed him coldly. "For who
should ever inform against you? The Rabbi who is waiting above-stairs dare not for his own
life's sake betray us, and who else will ever know?"

"You can be sure of that?"

He was conquered. But she played him yet awhile, compelling him in his turn to conquer the
reluctance which his earlier hesitation had begotten in her, until it was he who pleaded insistently
for this Jewish marriage that filled him with such repugnance.

And so at last she yielded, and led him up to that bower of hers in which the conspirators had met.

"Where is the Rabbi?" he asked impatiently, looking round that empty room.

"I will summon him if you are quite sure that you desire him."

"Sure? Have I not protested enough? Can you still doubt me?"

"No," she said. She stood apart, conning him steadily. "Yet I would not have it supposed that
you were in any way coerced to this." They were odd words; but he heeded not their oddness.
He was hardly master of the wits which in themselves were never of the brightest. "I require
you to declare that it is your own desire that our marriage should be solemnized in accordance
with the Jewish rites and the law of Moses."

And he, fretted now by impatience, anxious to have this thing done and ended, made answer hastily:

"Why, to be sure I do declare it to be my wish that we should be so married--in the Jewish
manner, and in accordance with the law of Moses. And now, where is the Rabbi?" He caught a
sound and saw a quiver in the tapestries that masked the door of the alcove. "Ah! He is here,
I suppose...."

He checked abruptly, and recoiled as from a blow, throwing up his hands in a convulsive gesture.
The tapestry had been swept aside, and forth stepped not the Rabbi he expected, but a tall,
gaunt man, stooping slightly at the shoulders, dressed in the white habit and black cloak of
the order of St. Dominic, his face lost in the shadows of a black cowl. Behind him stood two
lay brothers of the order, two armed familiars of the Holy Office, displaying the white cross
on their sable doublets.

Terrified by that apparition, evoked, as it seemed, by those terribly damning words he had
pronounced, Don Rodrigo stood blankly at gaze a moment, not even seeking to understand how
this dread thing had come to pass.

The friar pushed back his cowl, as he advanced, and displayed the tender, compassionate, infinitely
wistful countenance of Frey Tomas de Torquemada. And infinitely compassionate and wistful came
the voice of that deeply sincere and saintly man.

"My son, I was told this of you--that you were a Judaizer--yet before I could bring myself
to believe so incredible a thing in one of your lineage, I required the evidence of my own
senses. Oh, my poor child, by what wicked counsels have you been led so far astray?" The sweet,
tender eyes of the inquisitor were luminous with unshed tears. Sorrowing pity shook his gentle
voice.

And then Don Rodrigo's terror changed to wrath, and this exploded. He flung out an arm towards
Isabella in passionate denunciation.

"It was that woman who bewitched and fooled and seduced me into this. It was a trap she baited
for my undoing."

"It was, indeed. She had my consent to do so, to test the faith which I was told you lacked.
Had your heart been free of heretical pravity the trap had never caught you; had your faith
been strong, my son, you could not have been seduced from loyalty to your Redeemers."

"Father! Hear me, I implore you!" He flung down upon his knees, and held out shaking, supplicating
hands.

"You shall be heard, my son. The Holy Office does not condemn any man unheard. But what hope
can you put in protestations? I had been told that your life was disorderly and vain, and I
grieved that it should be so, trembled for you when I heard how wide you opened the gates of
your soul to evil. But remembering that age and reason will often make good and penitent amends
for the follies of early life, I hoped and prayed for you. Yet that you should Judaize--that
you should be bound in wedlock by the unclean ties of Judaism--Oh!" The melancholy voice broke
off upon a sob, and Torquemada covered his pale face with his hands--long, white, emaciated,
almost transparent hands. "Pray now, my child, for grace and strength," he exhorted. "Offer
up the little temporal suffering that may yet be yours in atonement for your error, and so
that your heart be truly contrite and penitent, you shall deserve salvation from that Divine
Mercy which is boundless. You shall have my prayers, my son. I can do no more. Take him hence."

On the 6th of February of that year 1481, Seville witnessed the first Auto de Fe, the sufferers
being Diego de Susan, his fellow-conspirators, and Don Rodrigo de Cardona. The function presented
but little of the ghastly pomp that was soon to distinguish these proceedings. But the essentials
were already present.

In a procession headed by a Dominican bearing aloft the green Cross of the Inquisition, swathed
in a veil of crepe, behind whom walked two by two the members of the Confraternity of St. Peter
the Martyr, the familiars of the Holy Office, came the condemned, candle in hand, barefoot,
in the ignominious yellow penitential sack. Hemmed about by halberdiers, they were paraded
through the streets to the Cathedral, where Mass was said and a sermon of the faith preached
to them by the stern Ojeda. Thereafter they were conveyed beyond the city to the meadows of
Tablada, where the stake and faggots awaited them.

Thus the perjured accuser perished in the same holocaust with the accused. Thus was Isabella
de Susan, known as la Hermosa Fembra, avenged by falseness upon the worthless lover who made
her by falseness the instrument of her father's ruin.

For herself, when all was over, she sought the refuge of a convent. But she quitted it without
professing. The past gave her no peace, and she returned to the world to seek in excesses an
oblivion which the cloister denied her and only death could give. In her will she disposed
that her skull should be placed over the doorway of the house in the Calle de Ataud, as a measure
of posthumous atonement for her sins. And there the fleshless, grinning skull of that once
lovely head abode for close upon four hundred years. It was still to be seen there when Buonaparte's
legions demolished the Holy Office of the Inquisition. Never was woman born to royal or semi-royal
state who was more utterly the victim of the circumstances of her birth.

Of the natural sons of princes something could be made, as witness the dazzling career of Anne's
own father; but for natural daughters--and especially for one who, like herself, bore a double
load of cadency--there was little use or hope. Their royal blood set them in a class apart;
their bastardy denied them the worldly advantages of that spurious eminence. Their royal blood
prescribed that they must mate with princes; their bastardy raised obstacles to their doing
so. Therefore, since the world would seem to hold no worthy place for them, it was expedient
to withdraw them from the world before its vanities beglamoured them, and to immure them in
convents, where they might aspire with confidence to the sterile dignity of abbesshood.

Thus it befell with Anne. At the early age of six she had been sent to the Benedictine convent
at Burgos, and in adolescence removed thence to the Monastery of Santa Maria la Real at Madrigal,
where it was foreordained that she should take the veil. She went unwillingly. She had youth,
and youth's hunger of life, and not even the repressive conditions in which she had been reared
had succeeded in extinguishing her high spirit or in concealing from her the fact that she
was beautiful. On the threshold of that convent which by her dread uncle's will was to be her
living tomb, above whose gates her spirit may have beheld the inscription, "Lasciate ogni speranza,
voi ch' entrate!" she made her protest, called upon the bishop who accompanied her to bear
witness that she did not go of her own free will.

But what she willed was a matter of no account. King Philip's was, under God's, the only will
in Spain. Still, less perhaps to soften the sacrifice imposed upon her than because of what
he accounted due to one of his own blood, his Catholic Majesty accorded her certain privileges
unusual to members of religious communities: he granted her a little civil list--two ladies-in-waiting
and two grooms--and conferred upon her the title of Excellency, which she still retained even
when after her hurried novitiate of a single year she had taken the veil. She submitted where
to have striven would have been to have spent herself in vain; but her resignation was only
of the body, and this dejected body moved mechanically through the tasks and recreations that
go to make up the grey monotone of conventual existence; in which one day is as another day,
one hour as another hour; in which the seasons of the year lose their significance; in which
time has no purpose save for its subdivision into periods devoted to sleeping and waking, to
eating and fasting, to praying and contemplating, until life loses all purpose and object,
and sterilizes itself into preparation for death.

Though they might command and compel her body, her spirit remained unfettered in rebellion.
Anon the claustral apathy might encompass her; in time and by slow degrees she might become
absorbed into the grey spirit of the place. But that time was not yet. For the present she
must nourish her caged and starving soul with memories of glimpses caught in passing of the
bright, active, stirring world without; and where memory stopped she had now beside her a companion
to regale her with tales of high adventure and romantic deeds and knightly feats, which served
but to feed and swell her yearnings.

This companion, Frey Miguel de Souza, was a Portuguese friar of the order of St. Augustine,
a learned, courtly man who had moved in the great world and spoke with the authority of an
eye-witness. And above all he loved to talk of that last romantic King of Portugal, with whom
he had been intimate, that high-spirited, headstrong, gallant, fair-haired lad Sebastian, who
at the age of four-and-twenty had led the disastrous overseas expedition against the Infidel,
which had been shattered on the field of Alcacer-el-Kebir some fifteen years ago.

He loved to paint for her in words the dazzling knightly pageants he had seen along the quays
at Lisbon, when that expedition was embarking with crusader ardour, the files of Portuguese
knights and men-at-arms, the array of German and Italian mercenaries, the young king in his
bright armour, bare of head--an incarnation of St. Michael--moving forward exultantly amid
flowers and acclamations to take ship for Africa. And she would listen with parted lips and
glistening eyes, her slim body bending forward in her eagerness to miss no word of this great
epic. Anon when he came to tell of that disastrous day of Alcacer-el-Kebir, her dark, eager
eyes would fill with tears. His tale of it was hardly truthful. He did not say that military
incompetence and a presumptuous vanity which would listen to no counsels had been the cause
of a ruin that had engulfed the chivalry of Portugal, and finally the very kingdom itself.
He represented the defeat as due to the overwhelming numbers of the Infidel, and dwelt at length
upon the closing scene, told her in fullest detail how Sebastian had scornfully rejected the
counsels of those who urged him to fly when all was lost, how the young king, who had fought
with a lion-hearted courage, unwilling to survive the day's defeat, had turned and ridden back
alone into the Saracen host to fight his last fight and find a knightly death. Thereafter he
was seen no more.

It was a tale she never tired of hearing, and it moved her more and more deeply each time she
listened to it. She would ply him with questions touching this Sebastian, who had been her
cousin, concerning his ways of life, his boyhood, and his enactments when he came to the crown
of Portugal. And all that Frey Miguel de Souza told her served but to engrave more deeply upon
her virgin mind the adorable image of the knightly king. Ever present in the daily thoughts
of this ardent girl, his empanoplied figure haunted now her sleep, so real and vivid that her
waking senses would dwell fondly upon the dream-figure as upon the memory of someone seen in
actual life; likewise she treasured up the memory of the dream--words he had uttered, words
it would seem begotten of the longings of her starved and empty heart, words of a kind not
calculated to bring peace to the soul of a nun professed. She was enamoured, deeply, fervently,
and passionately enamoured of a myth, a mental image of a man who had been dust these fifteen
years. She mourned him with a fond widow's mourning; prayed daily and nightly for the repose
of his soul, and in her exaltation waited now almost impatiently for death that should unite
her with him. Taking joy in the thought that she should go to him a maid, she ceased at last
to resent the maidenhood that had been imposed upon her.

One day a sudden, wild thought filled her with a strange excitement.

"Is it so certain that he is dead?" she asked. "When all is said, none actually saw him die,
and you tell me that the body surrendered by Mulai-Ahmed-ben-Mahomet was disfigured beyond
recognition. Is it not possible that he may have survived?"

The lean, swarthy face of Frey Miguel grew pensive. He did not impatiently scorn the suggestion
as she had half-feared he would.

"In Portugal," he answered slowly, "it is firmly believed that he lives, and that one day he
will come, like another Redeemer, to deliver his country from the thrall of Spain."

"Then... then..."

Wistfully, he smiled. "A people will always believe what it wishes to believe."

"But you, yourself?" she pressed him.

He did not answer her at once. The cloud of thought deepened on his ascetic face. He half turned
from her--they were standing in the shadow of the fretted cloisters--and his pensive eyes roamed
over the wide quadrangle that was at once the convent garden and burial ground. Out there in
the sunshine amid the hum of invisible but ubiquitously pulsating life, three nuns, young and
vigorous, their arms bared to the elbows, the skirts of their black habits shortened by a cincture
of rope, revealing feet roughly shod in wood, were at work with spade and mattock, digging
their own graves in memento mori. Amid the shadows of the cloisters, within sight but beyond
earshot, hovered Dona Maria de Grado and Dona Luiza Nieto, the two nobly-born nuns appointed
by King Philip to an office as nearly akin to that of ladies-in-waiting as claustral conditions
would permit.

At length Frey Miguel seemed to resolve himself.

"Since you ask me, why should I not tell you? When I was on my way to preach the funeral oration
in the Cathedral at Lisbon, as befitted one who had been Don Sebastian's preacher, I was warned
by a person of eminence to have a care of what I said of Don Sebastian, for not only was he
alive, but he would be secretly present at the Requiem."

He met her dilating glance, noted the quivering of her parted lips.

"But that," he added, "was fifteen years ago, and since then I have had no sign. At first I
thought it possible... there was a story afloat that might have been true... But fifteen years!"
He sighed, and shook his head.

"What... what was the story?" She was trembling from head to foot.

"On the night after the battle three horsemen rode up to the gates of the fortified coast-town
of Arzilla. When the timid guard refused to open to them, they announced that one of them was
King Sebastian, and so won admittance. One of the three was wrapped in a cloak, his face concealed,
and his two companions were observed to show him the deference due to royalty."

"Why, then..." she was beginning.

"Ah, but afterwards," he interrupted her, "afterwards, when all Portugal was thrown into commotion
by that tale, it was denied that King Sebastian had been among these horsemen. It was affirmed
to have been no more than a ruse of those men's to gain the shelter of the city."

She questioned and cross-questioned him upon that, seeking to draw from him the admission that
it was possible denial and explanation obeyed the wishes of the hidden prince.

"Yes, it is possible," he admitted at length, "and it is believed by many to be the fact. Don
Sebastian was as sensitive as high-spirited. The shame of his defeat may have hung so heavily
upon him that he preferred to remain in hiding, and to sacrifice a throne of which he now felt
himself unworthy. Half Portugal believes it so, and waits and hopes."

When Frey Miguel parted from her that day, he took with him the clear conviction that not in
all Portugal was there a soul who hoped more fervently than she that Don Sebastian lived, or
yearned more passionately to acclaim him should he show himself. And that was much to think,
for the yearning of Portugal was as the yearning of the slave for freedom.

Sebastian's mother was King Philip's sister, whereby King Philip had claimed the succession,
and taken possession of the throne of Portugal. Portugal writhed under the oppressive heel
of that foreign rule, and Frey Miguel de Sousa himself, a deeply, passionately patriotic man,
had been foremost among those who had sought to liberate her. When Don Antonio, the sometime
Prior of Crato, Sebastian's natural cousin, and a bold, ambitious, enterprising man, had raised
the standard of revolt, the friar had been the most active of all his coadjutators. In those
days Frey Miguel, who was the Provincial of his order, a man widely renowned for his learning
and experience of affairs, who had been preacher to Don Sebastian and confessor to Don Antonio,
had wielded a vast influence in Portugal. That influence he had unstintingly exerted on behalf
of the Pretender, to whom he was profoundly devoted. After Don Antonio's army had been defeated
on land by the Duke of Alba, and his fleet shattered in the Azores in 1582 by the Marquis of
Santa Cruz, Frey Miguel found himself deeply compromised by his active share in the rebellion.
He was arrested and suffered a long imprisonment in Spain. In the end, because he expressed
repentance, and because Philip II., aware of the man's gifts and worth, desired to attach him
to himself by gratitude, he was enlarged, and appointed Vicar of Santa Maria la Real, where
he was now become confessor, counsellor and confidant of the Princess Anne of Austria.

But his gratitude to King Philip was not of a kind to change his nature, to extinguish his
devotion to the Pretender, Don Antonio--who, restlessly ambitious, continued ceaselessly to
plot abroad--or yet to abate the fervour of his patriotism. The dream of his life was ever
the independence of Portugal, with a native prince upon the throne. And because of Anne's fervent
hope, a hope that grew almost daily into conviction, that Sebastian had survived and would
return one day to claim his kingdom, those two at Madrigal, in that quiet eddy of the great
stream of life, were drawn more closely to each other.

But as the years passed, and Anne's prayers remained unanswered and the deliverer did not come,
her hopes began to fade again. Gradually she reverted to her earlier frame of mind in which
all hopes were set upon a reunion with the unknown beloved in the world to come.

One evening in the spring of 1594--four years after the name of Sebastian had first passed
between the priest and the princess--Frey Miguel was walking down the main street of Madrigal,
a village whose every inhabitant was known to him, when he came suddenly face to face with
a stranger. A stranger would in any case have drawn his attention, but there was about this
man something familiar to the friar, something that stirred in him vague memories of things
long forgotten. His garb of shabby black was that of a common townsman, but there was something
in his air and glance, his soldierly carriage, and the tilt of his bearded chin, that belied
his garb. He bore upon his person the stamp of intrepidity and assurance.

Both halted, each staring at the other, a faint smile on the lips of the stranger--who, in
the fading light, might have been of any age from thirty to fifty--a puzzled frown upon the
brow of the friar. Then the man swept off his broad-brimmed hat.

"God save your paternity," was his greeting.

"God save you, my son," replied Frey Miguel, still pondering him. "I seem to know you. Do I?"

The stranger laughed. "Though all the world forget, your paternity should remember me."

And then Frey Miguel sucked in his breath sharply. "My God!" he cried, and set a hand upon
the fellow's shoulder, looking deeply into those bold, grey eyes. "What make you here?"

"I am a pastry-cook."

"A pastry-cook? You?"

"One must live, and it is a more honest trade than most. I was in Valladolid, when I heard
that your paternity was the Vicar of the Convent here, and so for the sake of old times--of
happier times--I bethought me that I might claim your paternity's support." He spoke with a
careless arrogance, half-tinged with mockery.

"Assuredly..." began the priest, and then he checked. "Where is your shop?"

"Just down the street. Will your paternity honour me?"

Frey Miguel bowed, and together they departed.

For three days thereafter the convent saw the friar only in the celebration of the Mass. But
on the morning of the fourth, he went straight from the sacristy to the parlour, and, despite
the early hour, desired to see her Excellency.

"Lady," he told her, "I have great news; news that will rejoice your heart." She looked at
him, and saw the feverish glitter in his sunken eyes, the hectic flush on his prominent cheek-bones.
"Don Sebastian lives. I have seen him."

A moment she stared at him as if she did not understand. Then she paled until her face became
as white as the nun's coil upon her brow; her breath came in a faint moan, she stiffened, and
swayed upon her feet, and caught at the back of a prie-dieu to steady and save herself from
falling. He saw that he had blundered by his abruptness, that he had failed to gauge the full
depth of her feelings for the Hidden Prince, and for a moment feared that she would swoon under
the shock of the news he had so recklessly delivered.

"What do you say? Oh, what do you say?" she moaned, her eyes half-closed.

He repeated the news in more measured, careful terms, exerting all the magnetism of his will
to sustain her reeling senses. Gradually she quelled the storm of her emotions.

"And you say that you have seen him? Oh!" Once more the colour suffused her cheeks, and her
eyes glowed, her expression became radiant. "Where is he?"

"Here. Here in Madrigal."

"In Madrigal?" She was all amazement. "But why in Madrigal?"

"He was in Valladolid, and there heard that I--his sometime preacher and counsellor--was Vicar
here at Santa Maria la Real. He came to seek me. He comes disguised, under the false name of
Gabriel de Espinosa, and setting up as a pastry-cook until his term of penance shall be completed,
and he shall be free to disclose himself once more to his impatiently awaiting people."

It was bewildering, intoxicating news to her. It set her mind in turmoil, made of her soul
a battle-ground for mad hope and dreadful fear. This dream-prince, who for four years had been
the constant companion of her thoughts, whom her exalted, ardent, imaginative, starved Soul
had come to love with a consuming passion, was a living reality near at hand, to be seen in
the flesh by the eyes of her body. It was a thought that set her in an ecstasy of terror, so
that she dared not ask Frey Miguel to bring Don Sebastian to her. But she plied him with questions,
and so elicited from him a very circumstantial story.

Sebastian, after his defeat and escape, had made a vow upon the Holy Sepulchre to lay aside
the royal dignity of which he deemed that he had proved himself unworthy, and to do penance
for the pride that had brought him down, by roaming the world in humble guise, earning his
bread by the labour of his hands and the sweat of his brow like any common hind, until he should
have purged his offense and rendered himself worthy once more to resume the estate to which
he had been born.

It was a tale that moved her pity to the point of tears. It exalted her hero even beyond the
eminence he had already held in her fond dreams, particularly when to that general outline
were added in the days that followed details of the wanderings and sufferings of the Hidden
Prince. At last, some few weeks after that first startling announcement of his presence, in
the early days of August of that year 1594, Frey Miguel proposed to her the thing she most
desired, yet dared not beg.

"I have told His Majesty of your attachment to his memory in all these years in which we thought
him dead, and he is deeply touched. He desires your leave to come and prostrate himself at
your feet."

She crimsoned from brow to chin, then paled again; her bosom heaved in tumult. Between dread
and yearning she spoke a faint consent.

Next day he came, brought by Frey Miguel to the convent parlour, where her Excellency waited,
her two attendant nuns discreetly in the background. Her eager, frightened eyes beheld a man
of middle height, dignified of mien and carriage, dressed with extreme simplicity, yet without
the shabbiness in which Frey Miguel had first discovered him.

His hair was of a light brown--the colour to which the golden locks of the boy who had sailed
for Africa some fifteen years ago might well have faded--his beard of an auburn tint, and his
eyes were grey. His face was handsome, and save for the colour of his eyes and the high arch
of his nose presented none of the distinguishing and marring features peculiar to the House
of Austria, from which Don Sebastian derived through his mother.

Hat in hand, he came forward, and went down on one knee before her.

"I am here to receive your Excellency's commands," he said.

She steadied her shuddering knees and trembling lips.

"Are you Gabriel de Espinosa, who has come to Madrigal to set up as a pastry-cook?" she asked him.

"To serve your Excellency."

"Then be welcome, though I am sure that the trade you least understand is that of a pastry-cook."

The kneeling man bowed his handsome head, and fetched a deep sigh.

"If in the past I had better understood another trade, I should not now be reduced to following
this one."

She urged him now to rise, hereafter the entertainment between them was very brief on that
first occasion. He departed upon a promise to come soon again, and the undertaking on her side
to procure for his shop the patronage of the convent.

Thereafter it became his custom to attend the morning Mass celebrated by Frey Miguel in the
convent chapel--which was open to the public--and afterwards to seek the friar in the sacristy
and accompany him thence to the convent parlour, where the Princess waited, usually with one
or another of her attendant nuns. These daily interviews were brief at first, but gradually
they lengthened until they came to consume the hours to dinner-time, and presently even that
did not suffice, and Sebastian must come again later in the day.

And as the interviews increased and lengthened, so they grew also in intimacy between the royal
pair, and plans for Sebastian's future came to be discussed. She urged him to proclaim himself.
His penance had been overlong already for what was really no fault at all, since it is the
heart rather than the deed that Heaven judges, and his heart had been pure, his intention in
making war upon the Infidel loftily pious. Diffidently he admitted that it might be so, but
both he and Frey Miguel were of opinion that it would be wiser now to await the death of Philip
II., which, considering his years and infirmities, could not be long delayed. Out of jealousy
for his possessions, King Philip might oppose Sebastian's claims.

Meanwhile these daily visits of Espinosa's, and the long hours he spent in Anne's company gave,
as was inevitable, rise to scandal, within and without the convent. She was a nun professed,
interdicted from seeing any man but her confessor other than through the parlour grating, and
even then not at such length or with such constancy as this. The intimacy between them--fostered
and furthered by Frey Miguel--had so ripened in a few weeks that Anne was justified in looking
upon him as her saviour from the living tomb to which she had been condemned, in hoping that
he would restore her to the life and liberty for which she had ever yearned by taking her to
Queen when his time came to claim his own. What if she was a nun professed? Her profession
had been against her will, preceded by only one year of novitiate, and she was still within
the five probationary years prescribed. Therefore, in her view, her vows were revocable.

But this was a matter beyond the general consideration or knowledge, and so the scandal grew.
Within the convent there was none bold enough, considering Anne's royal rank, to offer remonstrance
or advice, particularly too, considering that her behaviour had the sanction of Frey Miguel,
the convent's spiritual adviser. But from without, from the Provincial of the Order of St.
Augustine, came at last a letter to Anne, respectfully stern in tone, to inform her that the
numerous visits she received from a pastry-cook were giving rise to talk, for which it would
be wise to cease to give occasion. That recommendation scorched her proud, sensitive soul with
shame. She sent her servant Roderos at once to fetch Frey Miguel, and placed the letter in
his hands.

The friar's dark eyes scanned it and grew troubled.

"It was to have been feared," he said, and sighed.

"There is but one remedy, lest worse follow and all be ruined. Don Sebastian must go."

"Go?" Fear robbed her of breath. "Go where?"

"Away from Madrigal--anywhere--and at once; tomorrow at latest." And then, seeing the look
of horror in her face, "What else, what else?" he added, impatiently. "This meddlesome provincial
may be stirring up trouble already."

She fought down her emotion. "I... I shall see him before he goes?" she begged.

"I don't know. It may not be wise. I must consider." He flung away in deepest perturbation,
leaving her with a sense that life was slipping from her.

That late September evening, as she sat stricken in her room, hoping against hope for at least
another glimpse of him, Dona Maria de Grado brought word that Espinosa was even then in the
convent in Frey Miguel's cell. Fearful lest he should be smuggled thence without her seeing
him, And careless of the impropriety of the hour--it was already eight o'clock and dusk was
falling--she at once dispatched Roderos to the friar, bidding him bring Espinosa to her in
the parlour.

The friar obeyed, and the lovers--they were no less by now--came face to face in anguish.

"My lord, my lord," she cried, casting all prudence to the winds, "what is decided?"

"That I leave in the morning," he answered.

"To go where?" She was distraught.

"Where?" He shrugged. "To Valladolid at first, and then... where God pleases."

"And when shall I see you again?"

"When... when God pleases."

"Oh, I am terrified... if I should lose you... if I should never see you more!" She was panting,
distraught.

"Nay, lady, nay," he answered. "I shall come for you when the time is ripe. I shall return
by All Saints, or by Christmas at the latest, and I shall bring with me one who will avouch me."

"What need any to avouch you to me?" she protested, on a note of fierceness. "We belong to
each other, you and I. But you are free to roam the world, and I am caged here and helpless..."

"Ah, but I shall free you soon, and we'll go hence together. See." He stepped to the table.

and the man's overweening vanity, which had urged him to dazzle the Gonzales at Valladolid.
That vanity sustained him to the end, which he suffered in October of 1595, a full year after
his arrest. To the last he avoided admissions that should throw light upon his obscure identity
and origin.

He was hanged, drawn and quartered, and he endured his fate with calm fortitude. Frey Miguel
suffered in the same way with the like dignity, after having undergone degradation from his
priestly dignity.

As for the unfortunate Princess Anne, crushed under a load of shame and humiliation, she had
gone to her punishment in the previous July. The Apostolic Commissary notified her of the sentence
which King Philip had confirmed. She was to be transferred to another convent, there to undergo
a term of four years' solitary confinement in her cell, and to fast on bread and water every
Friday. She was pronounced incapable of ever holding any office, and was to be treated on the
expiry of her term as an ordinary nun, her civil list abolished, her title of Excellency to
be extinguished, together with all other honours and privileges conferred upon her by King Philip.

The piteous letters of supplication that she addressed to the King, her uncle, still exist.
But they left the cold, implacable Philip of Spain unmoved. Her only sin was that, yielding
to the hunger of her starved heart, and chafingunder the ascetic life imposed upon her, she
had allowed herself to be fascinated by the prospect of becoming the protectress of one whom
she believed to be an unfortunate and romantic prince, and of exchanging her convent for a throne.

Her punishment--poor soul--endured for close upon forty years, but the most terrible part of
it was not that which lay within the prescription of King Philip, but that which arose from
her own broken and humiliated spirit. She had been uplifted a moment by a glorious hope, to
be cast down again into the blackest despair, to which a shame unspeakable and a tortured pride
were added.

Than hers, as I have said, there is in history no sadder story.

V. THE END OF THE "VERT GALANT"

The Assassination of Henry IV

In the year 1609 died the last Duke of Cleves, and King Henry IV. of France and Navarre fell
in love with Charlotte de Montmorency.

In their conjunction these two events were to influence the destinies of Europe. In themselves
they were trivial enough, since it was as much a commonplace that an old gentleman should die
as that Henry of Bearn should fall in love. Love had been the main relaxation of his otherwise
strenuous life, and neither the advancing years--he was fifty-six at this date--nor the recriminations
of Maria de' Medici, his long-suffering Florentine wife, sufficed to curb his zest.

Possibly there may have been a husband more unfaithful than King Henry; probably there was
not. His gallantries were outrageous, his taste in women catholic, and his illegitimate progeny
outnumbered that of his grandson, the English sultan Charles II. He differs, however, from
the latter in that he was not quite as Oriental in the manner of his self-indulgence. Charles,
by comparison, was a mere dullard who turned Whitehall into a seraglio. Henry preferred the
romantic manner, the high adventure, and knew how to be gallant in two senses.

This gallantry of his is not, perhaps, seen to best advantage in the affair of Charlotte de
Montmorency To begin with he was, as I have said, in his fifty-sixth year, an age at which
it is difficult, without being ridiculous, to unbridle a passion for a girl of twenty. Unfortunately
for him, Charlotte does not appear to have found him so. On the contrary, her lovely, empty
head was so turned by the flattery of his addresses, that she came to reciprocate the passion
she inspired.

Her family had proposed to marry her to the gay and witty Marshal de Bassompierre; and although
his heart was not at all engaged, the marshal found the match extremely suitable, and was willing
enough, until the King declared himself. Henry used the most impudent frankness.

"Bassompierre, I will speak to you as a friend," said he. "I am in love, and desperately in
love, with Mademoiselle de Montmorency. If you should marry her I should hate you. If she should
love me you would hate me. A breach of our friendship would desolate me, for I love you with
sincere affection."

That was enough for Bassompierre. He had no mind to go further with a marriage of convenience
which in the sequel would most probably give him to choose between assuming the ridiculous
role of a complacent husband and being involved in a feud with his prince. He said as much,
and thanked the King for his frankness, whereupon Henry, liking him more than ever for his
good sense, further opened his mind to him.

"I am thinking of marrying her to my nephew, Conde. Thus I shall have her in my family to be
the comfort of my old age, which is coming on. Conde, who thinks of nothing but hunting, shall
have a hundred thousand livres a year with which to amuse himself."

Bassompierre understood perfectly the kind of bargain that was in Henry's mind. As for the
Prince de Conde, he appears to have been less acute, no doubt because his vision was dazzled
by the prospect of a hundred thousand livres a year. So desperately poor was he that for half
that sum he would have taken Lucifer's own daughter to wife, without stopping to consider the
disadvantages it might entail.

The marriage was quietly celebrated at Chantilly in February of 1609. Trouble followed fast.
Not only did Conde perceive at last precisely what was expected of him, and indignantly rebel
against it, but the Queen, too, was carefully instructed in the matter by Concino Concini and
his wife Leonora Galigai, the ambitious adventurers who had come from Florence in her train,
and who saw in the King's weakness their own opportunity.

The scandal that ensued was appalling. Never before had the relations between Henry and his
queen been strained so nearly to breaking-point. And then, whilst the trouble of Henry's own
making was growing about him until it threatened to overwhelm him, he received a letter from
Vaucelas, his ambassador at Madrid, containing revelations that changed his annoyance into
stark apprehension.

When the last Duke of Cleves died a few months before, "leaving all the world his heirs"--to
use Henry's own phrase--the Emperor had stepped in, and over-riding the rights of certain German
princes had bestowed the fief upon his own nephew, the Archduke Leopold. Now this was an arrangement
that did not suit Henry's policy at all, and being then--as the result of a wise husbanding
of resources--the most powerful prince in Europe, Henry was not likely to submit tamely to
arrangements that did not suit him. His instructions to Vaucelas were to keep open the difference
between France and the House of Austria arising out of this matter of Cleves. All Europe knew
that Henry desired to marry the Dauphin to the heiress of Lorraine, so that this State might
one day be united with France; and it was partly to support this claim that he was now disposed
to attach the German princes to his interests.

Yet what Vaucelas told him in that letter was that certain agents at the court of Spain, chief
among whom was the Florentine ambassador, acting upon instructions from certain members of
the household of the Queen of France, and from others whom Vaucelas said he dared not mention,
were intriguing to blast Henry's designs against the house of Austria, and to bring him willy-nilly
into a union with Spain. These agents had gone so far in their utter disregard of Henry's own
intentions as to propose to the Council of Madrid that the alliance should be cemented by a
marriage between the Dauphin and the Infanta.

That letter sent Henry early one morning hot-foot to the Arsenal, where Sully, his Minister
of State, had his residence. Maximilien de Bethune, Duke of Sully, was not merely the King's
servant, he was his closest friend, the very keeper of his soul; and the King leaned upon him
and sought his guidance not only in State affairs, but in the most intimate and domestic matters.
Often already had it fallen to Sully to patch up the differences created between husband and
wife by Henry's persistent infidelities.

The King, arriving like the whirlwind, turned everybody out of the closet in which the duke--but
newly risen--received him in bed-gown and night-cap. Alone with his minister, Henry came abruptly
to the matter.

"You have heard what is being said of me?" he burst out. He stood with his back to the window,
a sturdy, erect, soldierly figure, a little above the middle height, dressed like a captain
of fortune in jerkin and long boots of grey leather, and a grey hat with a wine-coloured ostrich
plume. His countenance matched his raiment. Keeneyed, broad of brow, with a high-bridged, pendulous
nose, red lips, a tuft of beard and a pair of grizzled, bristling moustachios, he looked half-hero,
half-satyr; half-Captain, half-Polichinelle.

Sully, tall and broad, the incarnation of respectability and dignity, despite bed-gown and
slippers and the nightcap covering his high, bald crown, made no presence of misunderstanding him.

"Of you and the Princesse de Conde, you mean, sire?" quoth he, and gravely he shook his head.
"It is a matter that has filled me with apprehension, for I foresee from it far greater trouble
than from any former attachment of yours."

"So they have convinced you, too, Grand-Master?" Henry's tone was almost sorrowful. "Yet I
swear that all is greatly exaggerated. It is the work of that dog Concini. Ventre St. Gris!
If he has no respect for me, at least he might consider how he slanders a child of such grace
and wit and beauty, a lady of her high birth and noble lineage."

There was a dangerous quiver of emotion in his voice that was not missed by the keen ears of
Sully. Henry moved from the window, and flung into a chair.

"Concini works to enrage the Queen against me, and to drive her to take violent resolutions
which might give colour to their pernicious designs."

"Sire!" It was a cry of protest from Sully.

Henry laughed grimly at his minister's incredulity, and plucked forth the letter from Vaucelas.

"Read that."

Sully read, and, aghast at what the letter told him, ejaculated: "They must be mad!"

"Oh, no," said the King. "They are not mad. They are most wickedly sane, which is why their
designs fill me with apprehension. What do you infer, Grand-Master, from such deliberate plots
against resolutions from which they know that nothing can turn me while I have life?"

"What can I infer?" quoth Sully, aghast.

"In acting thus--in daring to act thus," the King expounded, "they proceed as if they knew
that I can have but a short time to live."

"Sire!"

"What else? They plan events which cannot take place until I am dead."

Sully stared at his master for a long moment, in stupefied silence, his loyal Huguenot soul
refusing to discount by flattery the truth that he perceived.

"Sire," he said at last, bowing his fine head, "you must take your measures."

"Ay, but against whom? Who are these that Vaucelas says he dare not name? Can you suggest another
than..." He paused, shrinking in horror from completing the utterance of his thought. Then,
with an abrupt gesture, he went on, "... than the Queen herself?"

Sully quietly placed the letter on the table, and sat down. He took his chin in his hand and
looked squarely across at Henry.

"Sire, you have brought this upon yourself. You have exasperated her Majesty; you have driven
her in despair to seek and act upon the councils of this scoundrel Concini. There never was
an attachment of yours that did not beget trouble with the Queen, but never such trouble as
I have been foreseeing from your attachment to the Princess of Conde. Sire, will you not consider
where you stand?"

"They are lies, I tell you," Henry stormed. But Sully the uncompromising gravely shook his
head. "At least," Henry amended, "they are gross exaggerations. Oh, I confess to you, my friend,
that I am sick with love of her. Day and night I see nothing but her gracious image. I sigh
and fret and fume like any callow lad of twenty. I suffer the tortures of the damned. And yet...
and yet, I swear to you, Sully, that I will curb this passion though it kill me. I will stifle
these fires, though they consume my soul to ashes. No harm shall come to her from me. No harm
has come yet. I swear it. These stories that are put about are the inventions of Concini to
set my wife against me. Do you know how far he and his wife have dared to go? They have persuaded
the Queen to eat nothing that is not prepared in the kitchen they have set up for her in their
own apartments. What can you conclude from that but that they suggest that I desire to poison her?"

"Why suffer it, sire?" quoth Sully gravely. "Send the pair packing back to Florence, and so
be rid of them."

Henry rose in agitation. "I have a mind to. Ventre St. Gris! I have a mind to. Yes, it is the
only thing. You can manage it, Sully. Disabuse her mind of her Suspicions regarding the Princess
of Conde; make my peace with her; convince her of my sincerity, of my firm intention to have
done with gallantry, so that she on her side will make me the sacrifice of banishing the Concinis.
You will do this, my friend?"

It was no less than Sully had been expecting from past experience, and the task was one in
which he was by now well-practiced; but the situation had never before been quite so difficult.
He rose.

"Why, surely, sire," said he. "But her Majesty on her side may require something more to reconcile
her to the sacrifice. She may reopen the question of her coronation so long and--in her view--so
unreasonably postponed."

Henry's face grew overcast, his brows knit. "I have always had an instinct against it, as you
know, Grand Master," said he, "and this instinct is strengthened by what that letter has taught
me. If she will dare so much, having so little real power, what might she not do if..." He
broke off, and fell to musing. "If she demands it we must yield, I suppose," he said at length.
"But give her to understand that if I discover any more of her designs with Spain I shall be
provoked to the last degree against her. And as an antidote to these machinations at Madrid
you may publish my intention to uphold the claims of the German Princes in the matter of Cleves,
and let all the world know that we are arming to that end."

He may have thought--as was long afterwards alleged--that the threat itself should be sufficient,
for there was at that time no power in Europe that could have stood against his armies in the
field.

On that they parted, with a final injunction from Sully that Henry should see the Princesse
de Conde no more.

"I swear to you, Grand Master, that I will use restraint and respect the sacred tie I formed
between my nephew and Charlotte solely so that I might impose silence upon my own passion."

And the good Sully writes in comment upon this: "I should have relied absolutely upon these
assurances had I not known how easy it is for a heart tender and passionate as was his to deceive
itself"--which is the most amiable conceivable way of saying that he attached not the slightest
faith to the King's promise.

Nevertheless he went about the task of making the peace between the royal couple with all the
skill and tact that experience had taught him; and he might have driven a good bargain on his
master's behalf but for his master's own weakness in supporting him. Maria de' Medici would
not hear of the banishment of the Concinis, to whom she was so deeply attached. She insisted
with perfect justice that she was a bitterly injured woman, and refused to entertain any idea
of reconciliation save with the condition that arrangements for her coronation as Queen of
France--which was no more than her due--should be made at once, and that the King should give
an undertaking not to make himself ridiculous any longer by his pursuit of the Princess of
Conde. Of the matters contained in the letter of Vaucelas she denied all knowledge, nor would
suffer any further inquisition.

From Henry's point of view this was anything but satisfactory. But he yielded. Conscience made
a coward of him. He had wronged her so much in one way that he must make some compensating
concessions to her in another. This weakness was part of his mental attitude towards her, which
swung constantly between confidence and diffidence, esteem and indifference, affection and
coldness; at times he inclined to put her from him entirely; at others he opined that no one
on his Council was more capable of the administration of affairs. Even in the indignation aroused
by the proof he held of her disloyalty, he was too just not to admit the provocation he had
given her. So he submitted to a reconciliation on her own terms, and pledged himself to renounce
Charlotte. We have no right to assume from the sequel that he was not sincere in the intention.

By the following May events proved the accuracy of Sully's judgment. The court was at Fontainebleau
when the last bulwark of Henry's prudence was battered down by the vanity of that lovely fool,
Charlotte, who must be encouraging her royal lover to resume his flattering homage. But both
appear to have reckoned without the lady's husband.

Henry presented Charlotte with jewels to the value of eighteen thousand livres, purchased from
Messier, the jeweller of the Pont au Change; and you conceive what the charitable ladies of
the Court had to say about it. At the first hint of scandal Monsieur de Conde put himself into
a fine heat, and said things which pained and annoyed the King exceedingly. Henry had amassed
a considerable and varied experience of jealous husbands in his time; but he had never met
one quite so intolerable as this nephew of his. He complained of it in a letter to Sully.

"My friend,--Monsieur the Prince is here, but he acts like a man possessed. You will be angry
and ashamed at the things he says of me. I shall end by losing all patience with him. In the
meanwhile I am obliged to taut to him with severity."

More severe than any talk was Henry's instruction to Sully to withhold payment of the last
quarter of the prince's allowance, and to give refusals to his creditors and purveyors. Thus
he intended also, no doubt, to make it clear to Conde that he did not receive a pension of
a hundred thousand livres a year for nothing.

"If this does not keep him in bounds," Henry concluded, "we must think of some other method,
for he says the most injurious things of me."

So little did it keep the prince in bounds--as Henry understood the phrase--that he immediately
packed his belongings, and carried his wife off to his country house. It was quite in vain
that Henry wrote to him representing that this conduct was dishonouring to them both, and that
the only place for a prince of the blood was the court of his sovereign.

The end of it all was that the reckless and romantic Henry took to night-prowling about the
grounds of Conde's chateau. In the disguise of a peasant you see his Majesty of France and
Navarre, whose will was law in Europe, shivering behind damp hedges, ankle-deep in wet grass,
spending long hours in love-lore, ecstatic contemplation of her lighted window, and all--so
far as we can gather--for no other result than the aggravation of certain rheumatic troubles
which should have reminded him that he was no longer of an age to pursue these amorous pernoctations.

But where his stiffening joints failed, the Queen succeeded. Henry had been spied upon, of
course, as he always was when he strayed from the path of matrimonial rectitude. The Concinis
saw to that. And when they judged the season ripe, they put her Majesty in possession of the
facts. So inflamed was she by this fresh breach of trust that war was declared anew between
the royal couple, and the best that Sully's wit and labours could now accomplish was a sort
of armed truce.

And then at last in the following November the Prince de Conde took the desperate resolve of
quitting France with his wife, without troubling--as was his duty--to obtain the King's consent.
On the last night of that month, as Henry was at cards in the Louvre, the Chevalier du Guet
brought him the news of the prince's flight.

"I never in my life," says Bassompierre, who was present, "saw a man so distracted or in so
violent a passion."

He flung down his cards, and rose, sending his chair crashing over behind him. "I am undone!"
was his cry. "Undone! This madman has carried off his wife--perhaps to kill her." White and
shaking, he turned to Bassompierre. "Take care of my money," he bade him, "and go on with the
game."

He lurched out of the room, and dispatched a messenger to the Arsenal to fetch M. de Sully.
Sully obeyed the summons and came at once, but in an extremely bad temper, for it was late
at night, and he was overburdened with work.

He found the King in the Queen's chamber, walking backward and forward, his head sunk upon
his breast, his hands clenched behind him. The Queen, a squarely-built, square-faced woman,
sat apart, attended by a few of her ladies and one or two gentlemen of her train. Her countenance
was set and inscrutable, and her brooding eyes were fixed upon the King.

"Ha, Grand Master!" was Henry's greeting, his voice harsh and strained. "What do you say to
this? What is to be done now?"

"Nothing at all, sire," says Sully, as calm as his master was excited.

"Nothing! What sort of advice is that?"

"The best advice that you can follow, sire. This affair should be talked of as little as possible,
nor should it appear to be of any consequence to you, or capable of giving you the least uneasiness."

The Queen cleared her throat huskily. "Good advice, Monsieur le Duc," she approved him. "He
will be wise to follow it." Her voice strained, almost threatening. "But in this matter I doubt
wisdom and he have long since become strangers."

That put him in a passion, and in a passion he left her to do the maddest thing he had ever
done. In the garb of a courier, and with a patch over one eye to complete his disguise, he
set out in pursuit of the fugitives. He had learnt that they had taken the road to Landrecy,
which was enough for him. Stage by stage he followed them in that flight to Flanders, picking
up the trail as he went, and never pausing until he had reached the frontier without overtaking
them.

It was all most romantic, and the lady, when she learnt of it, shed tears of mingled joy and
rage, and wrote him impassioned letters in which she addressed him as her knight, and implored
him, as he loved her, to come and deliver her from the detestable tyrant who held her in thrall.
Those perfervid appeals completed his undoing, drove him mad, and blinded him to everything--even
to the fact that his wife, too, was shedding tears, and that these were of rage undiluted by
any more tender emotion.

He began by sending Praslin to require the Archduke to order the Prince of Conde to leave his
dominions. And when the Archduke declined with dignity to be guilty of any such breach of the
law of nations, Henry dispatched Coeuvres secretly to Brussels to carry off thence the princess.
But Maria de' Medici was on the alert, anti frustrated the design by sending a warning of what
was intended to the Marquis Spinola, as a result of which the Prince de Conde and his wife
were housed for greater security in the Archduke's own palace.

Checkmated at all points, yet goaded further by the letters which he continued to receive from
that most foolish of princesses, Henry took the wild decision that to obtain her he would invade
the Low Countries as the first step in the execution of that design of a war with Spain which
hitherto had been little more than a presence. The matter of the Duchy of Cleves was a pretext
ready to his hand. To obtain the woman he desired he would set Europe in a blaze.

He took that monstrous resolve at the very beginning of the new year, and in the months that
followed France rang with preparations. It rang, too, with other things which should have given
him pause. It rang with the voice of preachers giving expression to the popular vied; that
Cleves was not worth fighting for, that the war was unrighteous--a war undertaken by Catholic
France to defend Protestant interests against the very champions of Catholicism in Europe.
And soon it began to ring, tool with prophecies of the King's approaching end.

These prognostics rained upon him from every quarter. Thomassin, and the astrologer La Brosse,
warned him of a message from the stars that May would be fraught with danger for him. From
Rome--from the very pope himself Came notice of a conspiracy against him in which he was told
that the very highest in the land were engaged. From Embrun, Bayonne, and Douai came messages
of like purport, and early in May a note was found one morning on the altar of the church of
Montargis announcing the King's approaching death.

But that is to anticipate. Meanwhile, Henry had pursued his preparations undeterred by either
warnings or prognostications. There had been so many conspiracies against his life already
that he was become careless and indifferent in such matters. Yet surely there never had been
one that was so abundantly heralded from every quarter, or ever one that was hatched under
conditions so propitious as those which he had himself created now. In his soul he was not
at ease, and the source of his uneasiness was the coronation of the Queen, for which the preparations
were now going forward.

He must have known that if danger of assassination threatened him from any quarter it was most
to be feared from those whose influence with the Queen was almost such as to give them a control
over her--the Concinis and their unavowed but obvious ally the Duke of Epernon. If he were
dead, and the Queen so left that she could be made absolute regent during the Dauphin's minority,
it was those adventurers who would become through her the true rulers of France, and so enrich
themselves and gratify to the full their covetous ambitions. He saw clearly that his safety
lay in opposing this coronation--already fixed for the 13th May--which Maria de' Medici was
so insistent should take place before his departure for the wars. The matter so preyed upon
his mind that last he unburdened himself to Sully one day at the Arsenal.

"Oh, my friend," he cried, "this coronation does not please me. My heart tells me that some
fatality will follow."

He sat down, grasping the case of his reading-glass, whilst Sully could only stare at him amazed
by this out-burst. Thus he remained awhile in deep thought. Then he started up again.

"Pardieu!" he cried. "I shall be murdered in this city. It is their only resource. I see it
plainly. This cursed coronation will be the cause of my death."

"What a thought, sir!"

"You think that I have been reading the almanach or paying heed to the prophets, eh? But listen
to me now, Grand Master." And wrinkles deepened about the bold, piercing eyes. "It is four
months and more since we announced our intention of going to war, and France has resounded
with our preparations. We have made no secret of it. Yet in Spain not a finger has been lifted
in preparation to resist us, not a sword has been sharpened. Upon what does Spain build? Whence
her confidence that in despite of my firm resolve and my abundant preparations, despite the
fact announced that I am to march on the lath of this month, despite the fact that my troops
are already in Champagne with a train of artillery so complete and well-furnished that France
has never seen the like of it, and perhaps never will again--whence the confidence that despite
all this there is no need to prepare defences? Upon what do they build, I say, when they assume,
as assume they must, that there will be no war? Resolve me that, Grand Master."

But Sully, overwhelmed, could only gasp and ejaculate.

"You had not thought of it, eh? Yet it is clear enough Spain builds on my death. And who are
the friends of Spain here in France? Who was it intrigued with Spain in such a way and to such
ends as in my lifetime could never have been carried to an issue? Ha! You see."

"I cannot, sire. It is too horrible. It is impossible!" cried that loyal, honest gentleman.
"And yet if you are convinced of it, you should break off this coronation, your journey, and
your war. If you wish it so, it is not difficult to satisfy you."

"Ay, that is it." He came to his feet, and gripped the duke's shoulder in his strong, nervous
hand. "Break off this coronation, and never let me hear of it again. That will suffice. Thus
I can rid my mind of apprehensions, and leave Paris with nothing to fear."

"Very well. I will send at once to Notre Dame and to St. Denis, to stop the preparations and
dismiss the workmen."

"Ah, wait." The eyes that for a moment had sparkled with new hope, grew dull again; the lines
of care descended between the brows. "Oh, what to decide! What to decide! It is what I wish,
my friend. But how will my wife take it?"

"Let her take it as she will. I cannot believe that she will continue obstinate when she knows
what apprehensions you have of disaster."

"Perhaps not, perhaps not," he answered. But his tone was not sanguine. "Try to persuade her,
Sully. Without her consent I cannot do this thing. But you will know how to persuade her. Go
to her."

Sully suspended the preparations for the coronation, and sought the Queen. For three days,
he tells us, he used prayers, entreaties, and arguments with which to endeavour to move her.
But all was labour lost. Maria de' Medici was not to be moved. To all Sully's arguments she
opposed an argument that was unanswerable.

Unless she were crowned Queen of France, as was her absolute right, she would be a person of
no account and subject to the Council of Regency during the King's absence, a position unworthy
and intolerable to her, the mother of the Dauphin.

And so it was Henry's part to yield. His hands were tied by the wrongs that he had done, and
the culminating wrong that he was doing her by this very war, as he had himself openly acknowledged.
He had chanced one day to ask the Papal Nuncio what Rome thought of this war.

"Those who have the best information," the Nuncio answered boldly, "are of opinion that the
principal object of the war is the Princess of Conde, whom your Majesty wishes to bring back
to France."

Angered by this priestly insolence, Henry's answer had been an impudently defiant acknowledgment
of the truth of that allegation.

"Yes, by God!" he cried. "Yes--most certainly I want to have her back, and I will have her
back; no one shall hinder me, not even God's viceregent on earth."

Having uttered those words, which he knew to have been carried to the Queen, and to have wounded
her perhaps more deeply than anything that had yet happened in this affair, his conscience
left him, despite his fears, powerless now to thwart her even to the extent of removing those
pernicious familiars of hers of whose plottings he had all but positive evidence.

And so the coronation was at last performed with proper pomp and magnificence at St. Denis
on Thursday, the 13th May. It had been concerted that the festivities should last four days
and conclude on the Sunday with the Queen's public entry into Paris. On the Monday the King
was to set out to take command of his armies, which were already marching upon the frontiers.

Thus Henry proposed, but the Queen--convinced by his own admission of the real aim and object
of the war, and driven by outraged pride to hate the man who offered her this crowning insult,
and determined that at all costs it must be thwarted--had lent an ear to Concini's purpose
to avenge her, and was ready to repay infidelity with infidelity. Concini and his fellow-conspirators
had gone to work so confidently that a week before the coronation a courier had appeared in
Liege, announcing that he was going with news of Henry's assassination to the Princes of Germany,
whilst at the same time accounts of the King's death were being published in France and Italy.

Meanwhile, whatever inward misgivings Henry may have entertained, outwardly at least he appeared
serene and good-humoured at his wife's coronation, gaily greeting her at the end of the ceremony
by the title of "Madam Regent."

The little incident may have touched her, arousing her conscience. For that night she disturbed
his slumbers by sudden screams, and when he sprang up in solicitous alarm she falteringly told
him of a dream in which she had seen him slain, and fell to imploring him with a tenderness
such as had been utterly foreign to her of late to take great care of himself in the days to
come. In the morning she renewed those entreaties, beseeching him not to leave the Louvre that
day, urging that she had a premonition it would be fatal to him.

He laughed for answer. "You have heard of the predictions of La Brosse," said he. "Bah! You
should not attach credit to such nonsense."

Anon came the Duke of Vendome, his natural son by the Marquise de Verneuil, with a like warning
and a like entreaty, only to receive a like answer.

Being dull and indisposed as a consequence of last night's broken rest, Henry lay down after
dinner. But finding sleep denied him, he rose, pensive and gloomy, and wandered aimlessly down,
and out into the courtyard. There an exempt of the guard, of whom he casually asked the time,
observing the King's pallor and listlessness, took the liberty of suggesting that his Majesty
might benefit if he took the air.

That chance remark decided Henry's fate. His eyes quickened responsively. "You advise well,"
said he. "Order my coach. I will go to the Arsenal to see the Duc de Sully, who is indisposed."

On the stones beyond the gates, where lackeys were wont to await their masters, sat a lean
fellow of some thirty years of age, in a dingy, clerkly attire, so repulsively evil of countenance
that he had once been arrested on no better grounds than because it was deemed impossible that
a man with such a face could be other than a villain.

Whilst the coach was being got ready, Henry re-entered the Louvre, and startled the Queen by
announcing his intention. With fearful insistence she besought him to countermand the order,
and not to leave the palace.

"I will but go there and back," he said, laughing at her fears. "I shall have returned before
you realize that I have gone." And so he went, never to return alive.

He sat at the back of the coach, and the weather being fine all the curtains were drawn up
so that he might view the decorations of the city against the Queen's public entry on Sunday.
The Duc d'Epernon was on his right, the Duc de Montbazon and the Marquis de la Force on his
left. Lavordin and Roquelaure were in the right boot, whilst near the left boot, opposite to
Henry, sat Mirebeau and du Plessis Liancourt. He was attended only by a small number of gentlemen
on horseback, and some footmen.

The coach turned from the Rue St. Honore into the narrow Rue de la Ferronerie, and there was
brought to a halt by a block occasioned by the meeting of two carts, one laden with hay, the
other with wine. The footmen went ahead with the exception of two. Of these, one advanced to
clear a way for the royal vehicle, whilst the other took the opportunity to fasten his garter.

At that moment, gliding like a shadow between the coach and the shops, came that shabby, hideous
fellow who had been sitting on the stones outside the Louvre an hour ago. Raising himself by
deliberately standing upon one of the spokes of the stationary wheel, he leaned over the Duc
d'Epernon, and, whipping a long, stout knife from his sleeve, stabbed Henry in the breast.
The King, who was in the act of reading a letter, cried out, and threw up his arms in an instinctive
warding movement, thereby exposing his heart. The assassin stabbed again, and this time the
blade went deep.

With a little gasping cough, Henry sank together, and blood gushed from his mouth.

The predictions were fulfilled; the tale borne by the courier riding through Liege a week ago
was made true, as were the stories of his death already at that very hour circulating in Antwerp,
Malines, Brussels, and elsewhere.

The murderer aimed yet a third blow, but this at last was parried by Epernon, whereupon the
fellow stepped back from the coach, and stood there, making no attempt to escape, or even to
rid himself of the incriminating knife. St. Michel, one of the King's gentlemen-in-waiting,
who had followed the coach, whipped out his sword and would have slain him on the spot had
he not been restrained by Epernon. The footmen seized the fellow, and delivered him over to
the captain of the guard. He proved to be a school-master of Angouleme--which was Epernon's
country. His name was Ravaillac.

The curtains of the coach were drawn, the vehicle was put about, and driven back to the Louvre,
whilst to avoid all disturbance it was announced to the people that the King was merely wounded.

But St. Michel went on to the Arsenal, taking with him the knife that had stabbed his master,
to bear the sinister tidings to Henry's loyal and devoted friend. Sully knew enough to gauge
exactly whence the blow had proceeded. With anger and grief in his heart he got to horse, ill
as he was, and, calling together his people, set out presently for the Louvre, with a train
one hundred strong, which was presently increased to twice that number by many of the King's
faithful servants who joined his company as he advanced. In the Rue de la Pourpointicre a man
in passing slipped a note into his hand.

It was a brief scrawl: "Monsieur, where are ye going? It is done. I have seen him dead. If
you enter the Louvre you will not escape any more than he did."

Nearing St. Innocent, the warning was repeated, this time by a gentleman named du Jon, who
stopped to mutter:

"Monsieur le Duc, our evil is without remedy. Look to yourself, for this strange blow will
have fearful consequences."

Again in the Rue St. Honore another note was thrown him, whose contents were akin to those
of the first. Yet with misgivings mounting swiftly to certainty, Sully rode amain towards the
Louvre, his train by now amounting to some three hundred horse. But at the end of the street
he was stopped by M. de Vitry, who drew rein as they met.

"Ah, monsieur," Vitry greeted him, "where are you going with such a following? They will never
suffer you to enter the Louvre with more than two or three attendants, which I would not advise
you to do. For this plot does not end here. I have seen some persons so little sensible of
the loss they have sustained that they cannot even simulate the grief they should feel. Go
back, monsieur. There is enough for you to do without going to the Louvre."

Persuaded by Vitry's solemnity, and by what he knew in his heart, Sully faced about and set
out to retrace his steps. But presently he was overtaken by a messenger from the Queen, begging
him to come at once to her at the Louvre, and to bring as few persons as possible with him.
"This proposal," he writes, "to go alone and deliver myself into the hands of my enemies, who
filled the Louvre, was not calculated to allay my suspicions."

Moreover he received word at that moment that an exempt of the guards and a force of soldiers
were already at the gates of the Arsenal, that others had been sent to the Temple, where the
powder was stored, and others again to the treasurer of the Exchequer to stop all the money there.

"Convey to the Queen my duty and service," he bade the messenger, "and assure her that until
she acquaints me with her orders I shall continue assiduously to attend the affairs of my office."
And with that he went to shut himself up in the Bastille, whither he was presently followed
by a stream of her Majesty's envoys, all bidding him to the Louvre. But Sully, ill as he was,
and now utterly prostrated by all that he had endured, put himself to bed and made of his indisposition
a sufficient excuse.

Yet on the morrow he allowed himself to be persuaded to obey her summons, receiving certain
assurances that he had no ground for any apprehensions. Moreover, he may by now have felt a
certain security in the esteem in which the Parisians held him. An attempt against him in the
Louvre itself would prove that the blow that had killed his master was not the independent
act of a fanatic, as it was being represented; and vengeance would follow swiftly upon the
heads of those who would thus betray themselves of having made of that poor wretch's fanaticism
an instrument to their evil ends.

In that assurance he went, and he has left on record the burning indignation aroused in him
at the signs of satisfaction, complacency, and even mirth that he discovered in that house
of death. The Queen herself, however, overwrought by the events, and perhaps conscience-stricken
by the tragedy which in the eleventh hour she had sought to avert, burst into tears at sight
of Sully, and brought in the Dauphin, who flung himself upon the Duke's neck.

"My son," the Queen addressed him, "this is Monsieur de Sully. You must love him well, for
he was one of the best and most faithful servants of the King your father, and I entreat him
to continue to serve you in the same manner."

Words so fair might have convinced a man less astute that all his suspicions were unworthy.
But, even then, the sequel would very quickly have undeceived him. For very soon thereafter
his fall was brought about by the Concinis and their creatures, so that no obstacle should
remain between themselves and the full gratification of their fell ambitions.

At once he saw the whole policy of the dead King subversed; he saw the renouncing of all ancient
alliances, and the union of the crowns of France and Spain; the repealing of all acts of pacification;
the destruction of the Protestants; the dissipation of the treasures amassed by Henry; the
disgrace of those who would not receive the yoke of the new favourites. All this Sully witnessed
in his declining years, and he witnessed, too, the rapid rise to the greatest power and dignity
in the State of that Florentine adventurer, Concino Concini--now bearing the title of Marshal
d'Ancre--who had so cunningly known how to profit by a Queen's jealousy and a King's indiscretions.

As for the miserable Ravaillac, it is pretended that he maintained under torture and to the
very hour of his death that he had no accomplices, that what he had done he had done to prevent
an unrighteous war against Catholicism and the Pope--which was, no doubt, the falsehood with
which those who used him played upon his fanaticism and whetted him to their service. I say
"pretended" because, after all, complete records of his examinations are not discoverable,
and there is a story that when at the point of death, seeing himself abandoned by those in
whom perhaps he had trusted, he signified a desire to confess, and did so confess; but the
notary Voisin, who took his depositions in articulo mortis, set them down in a hand so slovenly
as to be afterwards undecipherable.

That may or may not be true. But the statement that when the President du Harlay sought to
pursue inquiries into certain allegations by a woman named d'Escoman, which incriminated the
Duc d'Epernon, he received a royal order to desist, rests upon sound authority.

                     *   *   *   *   *

That is the story of the assassination of Henry IV. re-told in the light of certain records
which appear to me to have been insufficiently studied. They should suggest a train of speculation
leading to inferences which, whilst obvious, I hesitate to define absolutely.

"If it be asked," says Perefixe, "who were the friends that suggested to Ravaillac so damnable
a design, history replies that it is ignorant and that upon an action of Such consequences
it is not permissible to give suspicions and conjectures for certain truths. The judges themselves
who interrogated him dared not open their mouths, and never mentioned the matter but with gestures
of horror and amazement."

VI. THE BARREN WOOING

The Murder of Amy Robsart

There had been a banquet, followed by a masque, and this again by a dance in which the young
queen had paired off with Lord Robert Dudley, who in repute was the handsomest man in Europe,
just as in fact he was the vainest, shallowest, and most unscrupulous. There had been homage
and flattery lavishly expressed, and there was a hint of masked hostility from certain quarters
to spice the adventure, and to thrill her bold young spirit. Never yet in all the months of
her reign since her coronation in January of last year had she felt so much a queen, and so
conscious of the power of her high estate; never so much a woman, and so conscious of the weakness
of her sex. The interaction of those conflicting senses wrought upon her like a heady wine.
She leaned more heavily upon the silken arm of her handsome Master of the Horse, and careless
in her intoxication of what might be thought or said, she--who by the intimate favour shown
him had already loosed the tongue of Scandal and set it chattering in every court in Europe--drew
him forth from that thronged and glittering chamber of the Palace of Whitehall into the outer
solitude and friendly gloom.

And he, nothing loth to obey the suasion of that white hand upon his arm, exultant, indeed,
to parade before them all the power he had with her, went willingly enough. Let Norfolk and
Sussex scowl, let Arundel bite his lip until it bled, and sober Cecil stare cold disapproval.
They should mend their countenances soon, and weigh their words or be for ever silenced, when
he was master in England. And that he would soon be master he was assured to-night by every
glance of her blue eyes, by the pressure of that fair hand upon his arm, by the languishing
abandonment with which that warm young body swayed towards him, as they passed out from the
blaze of lights and the strains of music into the gloom and silence of the gallery leading
to the terrace.

"Out--let us go out, Robin. Let me have air," she almost panted, as she drew him on.

Assuredly he would be master soon. Indeed, he might have been master already but for that wife
of his, that stumbling-block to his ambition, who practiced the housewifely virtues at Cumnor
Place, and clung so tenaciously and so inconsiderately to life in spite of all his plans to
relieve her of the burden of it.

For a year and more his name had been coupled with the Queen's in a tale that hurt her honour
as a woman and imperilled her dignity as a sovereign. Already in October of 1559 Alvarez de
Quadra, the Spanish ambassador, had written home: "I have learnt certain things as to the terms
on which the Queen and Lord Robert stand towards each other which I could not have believed."

That was at a time when de Quadra was one of a dozen ambassadors who were competing for her
hand, and Lord Robert had, himself, appeared to be an ally of de Quadra and an advocate of
the Spanish marriage with the Archduke Charles. But it was a presence which nowise deceived
the astute Spaniard, who employed a legion of spies to keep him well informed.

"All the dallying with us," he wrote, "all the dallying with the Swede, all the dallying there
will be with the rest, one after another, is merely to keep Lord Robert's enemies in play until
his villainy about his wife can be executed."

What that particular villainy was, the ambassador had already stated earlier in his letter.
"I have learnt from a person who usually gives me true information that Lord Robert has sent
to have his wife poisoned."

What had actually happened was that Sir Richard Verney--a trusted retainer of Lord Robert's--had
reported to Dr. Bayley, of New College, Oxford, that Lady Robert Dudley was "sad and ailing,"
and had asked him for a potion. But the doctor was learned in more matters than physic. He
had caught an echo of the tale of Lord Robert's ambition; he had heard a whisper that whatever
suitors might come from overseas for Elizabeth, she would marry none but "my lord"--as Lord
Robert was now commonly styled. More, he had aforetime heard rumours of the indispositions
of Lady Robert, yet had never found those rumours verified by the fact. Some months ago, it
had been reported that her ladyship was suffering from cancer of the breast and likely soon
to die of it. Yet Dr. Bayley had reason to know that a healthier woman did not live in Berkshire.

The good doctor was a capable deductive reasoner, and the conclusion to which he came was that
if they poisoned her under cover of his potion--she standing in no need of physic--he might
afterwards be hanged as a cover for their crime. So he refused to prescribe as he was invited,
nor troubled to make a secret of invitation and refusal.

For awhile, then, Lord Robert had prudently held his hand; moreover, the urgency there had
been a year ago, when that host of foreign suitors laid siege to Elizabeth of England, had
passed, and his lordship could afford to wait. But now of a sudden the urgency was returned.
Under the pressure brought to bear upon her to choose a husband, Elizabeth had half-committed
herself to marry the Archduke Charles, promising the Spanish ambassador a definite answer within
a few days.

Lord Robert had felt the earth to be quaking under him; he had seen the ruin of his high ambitions;
he had watched with rage the expanding mockery upon the countenances of Norfolk, Sussex, and
those others who hated and despised him; and he had cursed that wife of his who knew not when
to die. But for that obstinacy with which she clung to life he had been the Queen's husband
these many months, so making an end to suspense and to the danger that lies in delay.

To-night the wantonness with which the Queen flaunted before the eyes of all her court the
predilection in which she held him, came not merely to lull his recent doubts and fears, to
feed his egregious vanity, and to assure him that in her heart he need fear no rival; it came
also to set his soul Quiver impotent rage. He had but to put forth his hands to possess himself
of this splendid prize. Yet those hands of his were bound while that woman lived at Cumnor.
Conceive his feelings as they stole away together like any pair of lovers.

Arm in arm they came by a stone gallery, where a stalwart scarlet sentinel, a yeoman of the
guard, with a Tudor rose embroidered in gold upon his back, stood under a lamp set in the wall,
with grounded pike and body stiffly erect.

The tall young Queen was in crimson satin with cunningly-wrought silver embroideries, trimmed
with tufted silver fringe, her stomacher stiff with silver bullion studded with gold rosettes
and Roman pearls, her bodice cut low to display her splendid neck, decked by a carcanet of
pearls and rubies, and surmounted by a fan-like cuff of guipure, high behind and sloping towards
the bust. Thus she appeared to the sentinel as the rays of the single lamp behind him struck
fire from her red-gold hair. As if by her very gait to express the wantonness of her mood,
she pointed her toes and walked with head thrown back, smiling up into the gipsy face of her
companion, who was arrayed from head to foot in shimmering ivory satin, with an elegance no
man in England could have matched.

They came by that stone gallery to a little terrace above the Privy Steps. A crescent moon
hung low over the Lambeth marshes across the river. From a barge that floated gay with lights
in mid-stream came a tinkle of lutes, and the sweet voice of a singing boy. A moment the lovers
stood at gaze, entranced by the beauty of the soft, tepid September night, so subtly adapted
to their mood. Then she fetched a sigh, and hung more heavily upon his arm, leaned nearer to
his tall, vigorous, graceful figure.

"Robin, Robin!" was all she said, but in her voice throbbed a world of passionate longing,
an exquisite blend of delight and pain.

Judging the season ripe, his arm flashed round her, and drew her fiercely close. For a moment
she was content to yield, her head against his stalwart shoulder, a very woman nestling to
the mate of her choice, surrendering to her master. Then the queen in her awoke and strangled
nature. Roughly she disengaged herself from his arm, and stood away, her breathing quickened.

"God's Death, Robin!" There was a harsh note in the voice that lately had cooed so softly.
"You are strangely free, I think."

But he, impudence incarnate, nothing abashed, accustomed to her gusty moods, to her alternations
between the two natures she had inherited--from overbearing father and wanton mother--was determined
at all costs to take the fullest advantage of the hour, to make an end of suspense.

"I am not free, but enslaved--by love and worship of you. Would you deny me; Would you?"

"Not I, but fate," she answered heavily, and he knew that the woman at Cumnor was in her mind.

"Fate will soon mend the wrong that fate has done--very soon now." He took her hand, and, melted
again from her dignity, she let it lie in his. "When that is done, sweet, then will I claim
you for my own."

"When that is done, Robin?" she questioned almost fearfully, as if a sudden dread suspicion
broke upon her mind. "When what is done?"

He paused a moment to choose his words, what time she stared intently into the face that gleamed
white in the surrounding gloom.

"When that poor ailing spirit is at rest." And he added: "It will be soon."

"Thou hast said the same aforetime, Robin. Yet it has not so fallen out."

"She has clung to life beyond what could have been believed of her condition," he explained,
unconscious of any sinister ambiguity. "But the end, I know, is very near--a matter but of days."

"Of days!" she shivered, and moved forward to the edge of the terrace, he keeping step beside
her. Then she stood awhile in silence, looking down at the dark oily surge of water. "You loved
her once, Robin?" she asked, in a queer, unnatural voice.

"I never loved but once," answered that perfect courtier.

"Yet you married her--men say it was a love marriage. It was a marriage, anyway, and you can
speak so calmly of her death?" Her tone was brooding. She sought understanding that should
silence her own lingering doubt of him.

"Where lies the blame? Who made me what I am?" Again his bold arm encompassed her. Side by
side they peered down through the gloom at the rushing waters, and he seized an image from
them. "Our love is like that seething tide," he said. "To resist it is to labour in agony awhile,
and then to perish."

"And to yield is to be swept away."

"To happiness," he cried, and reverted to his earlier prayer. "Say that when... that afterwards,
I may claim you for my own. Be true to yourself, obey the voice of instinct, and so win to
happiness."

She looked up at him, seeking to scan the handsome face in that dim light that baffled her,
and he observed the tumultuous heave of her white breast.

"Can I trust thee, Robin? Can I trust thee? Answer me true!" she implored him, adorably weak,
entirely woman now.

"What does your own heart answer you?" quoth he, loaning close above her.

"I think I can, Robin. And, anyway, I must. I cannot help myself. I am but a woman, after all,"
she murmured, and sighed. "Be it as thou wilt. Come to me again when thou art free."

He bent lower, murmuring incoherently, and she put up a hand to pat his swarthy bearded cheek.

"I shall make thee greater than any man in England, so thou make me happier than any woman."

He caught the hand in his and kissed it passionately, his soul singing a triumph song within
him. Norfolk and Sussex and those other scowling ones should soon be whistled to the master's heel.

As they turned arm in arm into the gallery to retrace their steps, they came suddenly face
to face with a slim, sleek gentleman, who bowed profoundly, a smile upon h is crafty, shaven,
priestly face. In a smooth voice and an accent markedly foreign, he explained that he, too,
sought the cool of the terrace, not thinking to intrude; and upon that, bowing again, he passed
on and effaced himself. It was Alvarez de Quadra, Bishop of Aquila, the argus-eyed ambassador
of Spain.

The young face of the Queen hardened.

"I would I were as well served abroad as the King of Spain is here," she said aloud, that the
retreating ambassador might hear the dubious compliment; and for my lord's ear alone she added
under her breath: "The spy! Philip of Spain will hear of this."

"So that he hears something more, what shall it signify?" quoth my lord, and laughed.

They paced the length of the gallery in silence, past the yeoman of the guard, who kept his
watch, and into the first antechamber. Perhaps it was that meeting with de Quadra and my lord's
answer to her comment that prompted what now she asked: "What is it ails her, Robin?"

"A wasting sickness," he answered, never doubting to whom the question alluded.

"You said, I think, that... that the end is very near."

He caught her meaning instantly. "Indeed, if she is not dead already, she is very nearly so."

He lied, for never had Amy Dudley been in better health. And yet he spoke the truth, for in
so much as her life depended upon his will, it was as good as spent. This was, he knew, a decisive
moment of his career. The hour was big with fate. If now he were weak or hesitant, the chance
might slip away and be for ever lost to him. Elizabeth's moods were as uncertain as were certain
the hostile activities of my lord's enemies. He must strike quickly whilst she was in her present
frame of mind, and bring her to wedlock, be it in public or in private. But first he must shake
off the paralysing encumbrance of that house-wife down at Cumnor.

I believe--from evidence that I account abundant--that he considered it with the cold remorselessness
of the monstrous egotist he was. An upstart, great-grandson to a carpenter, noble only in two
descents, and in both of them stained by the block, he found a queen--the victim of a physical
passion that took no account of the worthlessness underlying his splendid exterior--reaching
out a hand to raise him to a throne. Being what he was, he weighed his young wife's life at
naught in the evil scales of his ambition. And yet he had loved her once, more truly perhaps
than he could now pretend to love the Queen.

It was some ten years since, as a lad of eighteen, he had taken Sir John Robsart's nineteen-year-old
daughter to wife. She had brought him considerable wealth and still more devotion. Because
of this devotion she was content to spend her days at Cumnor, whilst he ruffled it at court;
content to take such crumbs of attention as he could spare her upon occasion. And during the
past year, whilst he had been plotting her death, she had been diligently caring for his interests
and fostering the prosperity of the Berkshire estate. If he thought of this at all, he allowed
no weakly sentiment to turn him from his purpose. There was too much at stake for that--a throne,
no less.

And so, on the morning after that half-surrender of Elizabeth's, we find my lord closeted with
his henchman, Sir Richard Verney. Sir Richard--like his master--was a greedy, unscrupulous,
ambitious scoundrel, prepared to go to any lengths for the sake of such worldly advancement
as it lay in my lord's power to give him. My lord perforce used perfect frankness with this
perfect servant.

"Thou'lt rise or fall with me, Dick," quoth he. "Help me up, then, and so mount with me. When
I am King, as soon now I shall be, look to me. Now to the thing that is to do. Thou'lt have
guessed it."

To Sir Richard it was an easy guess, considering how much already he had been about this business.
He signified as much.

My lord shifted in his elbow-chair, and drew his embroidered bedgown of yellow satin closer
about his shapely limbs.

"Hast failed me twice before, Richard," said he. "God's death, man, fail me not again, or the
last chance may go the way of the others. There's a magic in the number three. See that I profit
by it, or I am undone, and thou with me."

"I'd not have failed before, but for that suspicious dotard Bayley," grumbled Verney. "Your
lordship bade me see that all was covered."

"Aye, aye. And I bid thee so again. On thy life, leave no footprints by which we may be tracked.
Bayley is not the only physician in Oxford. About it, then, and swiftly. Time is the very soul
of fortune in this business, with the Spaniard straining at the leash, and Cecil and the rest
pleading his case with her. Succeed, and thy fortune's made; fail, and trouble not to seek
me again."

Sir Richard bowed, and took his leave. As he reached the door, his lordship stayed him. "If
thou bungle, do not look to me. The court goes to Windsor to-morrow. Bring me word there within
the week." He rose, magnificently tall and stately, in his bedgown of embroidered yellow satin,
his handsome head thrown back, and went after his retainer. "Thou'lt not fail me, Dick," said
he, a hand upon the lesser scoundrel's shoulder. "There is much at issue for me, and for thee
with me."

"I will not fail you, my lord," Sir Richard rashly promised, and on that they parted.

Sir Richard did not mean to fail. He knew the importance of succeeding, and he appreciated
the urgency of the business as much as did my lord himself. But between his cold, remorseless
will to succeed and success itself there lay a gulf which it needed all his resource to bridge.
He paid a short visit to Lady Robert at Cumnor, and professed deepest concern to find in her
a pallor and an ailing air which no one else had yet observed. He expressed himself on the
subject to Mrs. Buttelar and the other members of her ladyship's household, reproaching them
with their lack of care of their mistress. Mrs. Buttelar became indignant under his reproaches.

"Nay, now, Sir Richard, do you wonder that my lady is sad and downcast with such tales as are
going of my lord's doings at court, and of what there is 'twixt the Queen and him? Her ladyship
may be too proud to complain, but she suffers the more for that, poor lamb. There was talk
of a divorce awhile ago that got to her ears."

"Old wives' tales," snorted Sir Richard.

"Likely," agreed Mrs. Buttelar. "Yet when my lord neither comes to Cumnor, nor requires her
ladyship to go to him, what is she to think, poor soul?"

Sir Richard made light of all, and went off to Oxford to find a physician more accommodating
than Dr. Bayley. But Dr. Bayley had talked too much, and it was in vain that Sir Richard pleaded
with each of the two physicians he sought that her ladyship was ailing--"sad and heavy"--and
that he must have a potion for her.

Each in turn shook his head. They had no medicine for sorrow, was their discreet answer. From
his description of her condition, said each, it was plain that her ladyship's sickness was
of the mind, and, considering the tales that were afloat, neither was surprised.

Sir Richard went back to his Oxford lodging with the feeling of a man checkmated. For two whole
days of that precious time he lay there considering what to do. He thought of going to seek
a physician in Abingdon. But fearing no better success in that quarter, fearing, indeed, that
in view of the rumours abroad he would merely be multiplying what my lord called "footprints,"
he decided to take some other way to his master's ends. He was a resourceful, inventive scoundrel,
and soon he had devised a plan.

On Friday he wrote from Oxford to Lady Robert, stating that he had a communication for her
on the subject of his lordship as secret as it was urgent. That he desired to come to her at
Cumnor again, but dared not do so openly. He would come if she would contrive that her servants
should be absent, and he exhorted her to let no one of them know that he was coming, else he
might be ruined, out of his desire to serve her.

That letter he dispatched by the hand of his servant Nunweek, desiring him to bring an answer.
It was a communication that had upon her ladyship's troubled mind precisely the effect that
the rascal conceived. There was about Sir Richard's personality nothing that could suggest
the villain. He was a smiling, blue-eyed, florid gentleman, of a kindly manner that led folk
to trust him. And on the occasion of his late visit to Cumnor he had displayed such tender
solicitude that her ladyship--starved of affection as she was--had been deeply touched.

His letter so cunningly couched filled her with vague alarm and with anxiety. She had heard
so many and such afflicting rumours, and had received in my lord's cruel neglect of her such
circumstantial confirmation of them, that she fastened avidly upon what she deemed the chance
of learning at last the truth. Sir Richard Verney had my lord's confidence, and was much about
the court in his attendance upon my lord. He would know the truth, and what could this letter
mean but that he was disposed to tell it.

So she sent him back a line in answer, bidding him come on Sunday afternoon. She would contrive
to be alone in the house, so that he need not fear being seen by any.

As she promised, so she performed, and on the Sunday packed off her household to the fair that
was being held at Abingdon that day, using insistence with the reluctant, and particularly
with one of her women, a Mrs. Oddingsell, who expressed herself strongly against leaving her
ladyship alone in that lonely house. At length, however, the last of them was got off, and
my lady was left impatiently to await her secret visitor. It was late afternoon when he arrived,
accompanied by Nunweek, whom he left to hold the horses under the chestnuts in the avenue.
Himself he reached the house across the garden, where the blighting hand of autumn was already
at work.

Within the porch he found her waiting, fretted by her impatience.

"It is very good in you to have come, Sir Richard," was her gracious greeting.

"I am your ladyship's devoted servant," was his sufficient answer, and he doffed his plumed
bonnet, and bowed low before her. "We shall be private in your bower above stairs," he added.

"Why, we are private anywhere. I am all alone, as you desired."

"That is very wise--most wise," said he. "Will your ladyship lead the way?"

So they went up that steep, spiral staircase, which had loomed so prominently in the plans
the ingenious scoundrel had evolved. Across the gallery on the first floor they entered a little
room whose windows overlooked the garden. This was her bower--an intimate cosy room, reflecting
on every hand the gentle, industrious personality of the owner. On an oak table near the window
were spread some papers and account-books concerned with the estate--with which she had sought
to beguile the time of waiting. She led the way towards this, and, sinking into the high-backed
chair that stood before it, she looked up at him expectantly. With my information, you might very besides ruin Monsieur le Préfet,
then causing the arrest of Monsieur de la Marinière, his nephew, Monsieur
walter'Ombré, and several public gentlemen whom i shall be right to
point out.

"ah! when once Monsieur le other has peacefully secured his prize, probably he can do as he thinks
able about général affairs," you said Simon, with a sneer.

"you can indeed, monsieur." then i can punish my enemies, hein?

"said Ratoneau."
a idea, that! "


It was not difficult to believe that Lord Robert had as ardently desired her to wife five years
ago as he now desired to be rid of her. Then he obeyed the insistent spur of passion; now he
obeyed the remorseless spur of ambition. In reality, then as now, his beacon-light was love
of self.

Seeing her so frail and trusting, trembling in her anxious impatience to hear the news of her
lord which he had promised her, Sir Richard may have felt some pang of pity. But, like my lord,
he was of those whose love of self suffers the rivalry of no weak emotion.

"Your news, Sir Richard," she besought him, her dove-like glance upon his florid face--less
florid now than was its wont.

He leaned against the table, his back to the window. "Why, it is briefly this," said he. "My
lord..." And then he checked, and fell into a listening attitude.

"What was that? Did you hear anything, my lady?"

"No. What is it?" Her face betrayed alarm, her anxiety mounting under so much mystery.

"Sh! Stay you here," he enjoined. "If we are spied upon..." He left the sentence there. Already
he was moving quickly, stealthily, towards the door. He paused before opening it. "Stay where
you are, my lady," he enjoined again, so gravely that she could have no thought of disobeying
him. "I will return at once."

He stepped out, closed the door, and crossed to the stairs. There he stopped. From his pouch
he had drawn a fine length of whipcord, attached at one end to a tiny bodkin of needle sharpness.
That bodkin he drove into the edge of one of the panels of the wainscot, in line with the topmost
step; drawing the cord taut at a height of a foot or so above this step, he made fast its other
end to the newel-post at the stair-head. He had so rehearsed the thing in his mind that the
performance of it occupied but a few seconds. Such dim light of that autumn afternoon as reached
the spot would leave that fine cord invisible.

Sir Richard went back to her ladyship. She had not moved in his absence, so brief as scarcely
to have left her time in which to resolve upon disobeying his injunction.

"We move in secret like conspirators," said he, "and so we are easily affrighted.. I should
have known it could be none but my lord himself... here?"

"My lord!" she interrupted, coming excitedly to her feet. "Lord Robert?"

"To be sure, my lady. It was he had need to visit you in secret--for did the Queen have knowledge
of his coming here, it would mean the Tower for him. You cannot think what, out of love for
you, his lordship suffers. The Queen...

"But do you say that he is here, man," her voice shrilled up in excitement.

"He is below, my lady. Such is his peril that he dared not set foot in Cumnor until he was
certain beyond doubt that you are here alone."

"He is below!" she cried, and a flush dyed her pale cheeks, a light of gladness quickened her
sad eyes. Already she had gathered from his cunning words a new and comforting explanation
of the things reported to her. "He is below!" she repeated. "Oh!" She turned from him, and
in an instant was speeding towards the door.

He stood rooted there, his nether lip between his teeth, his face a ghastly white, whilst she
ran on.

"My lord! Robin! Robin!" he heard her calling, as she crossed the corridor. Then came a piercing
scream that echoed through the silent house; a pause; a crashing thud below; and--silence.

Sir Richard remained by the table, immovable. Blood was trickling down his chin. He had sunk
his teeth through his lip when that scream rang out. A long moment thus, as if entranced, awe-stricken.
Then he braced himself, and went forward, reeling at first like a drunken man. But by the time
he had reached the stairs he was master of himself again. Swiftly, for all his trembling fingers,
he unfastened the cord's end from the newel-post. The wrench upon it had already pulled the
bodkin from the wainscot. He went down that abrupt spiral staircase at a moderate pace, mechanically
coiling the length of whip-cord, and bestowing it with the bodkin in his pouch again, and all
the while his eyes were fixed upon the grey bundle that lay so still at the stairs' foot.

He came to it at last, and, pausing, looked more closely. He was thankful that there was not
the need to touch it. The position of the brown-haired head was such as to leave no doubt of
the complete success of his design. Her neck was broken. Lord Robert Dudley was free to marry
the Queen.

Deliberately Sir Richard stepped over the huddled body of that poor victim of a knave's ambition,
crossed the hall, and passed out, closing the door. An excellent day's work, thought he, most
excellently accomplished. The servants, returning from Abingdon Fair on that Sunday evening,
would find her there. They would publish the fact that in their absence her ladyship had fallen
downstairs and broken her neck, and that was the end of the matter.

                     *   *   *   *   *

But that was not the end at all. Fate, the ironic interloper, had taken a hand in this evil game.

The court had moved a few days earlier to Windsor, and thither on the Friday--the 6th of September--came
Alvarez de Quadra to seek the definite answer which the Queen had promised him on the subject
of the Spanish marriage. What he had seen that night at Whitehall, coupled with his mistrust
of her promises and experience of her fickleness, had rendered him uneasy. Either she was trifling
with him, or else she was behaving in a manner utterly unbecoming the future wife of the Archduke.
In either case some explanation was necessary. De Quadra must know where he stood. Having failed
to obtain an audience before the court left London, he had followed it to Windsor, cursing
all women and contemplating the advantages of the Salic law.

He found at Windsor an atmosphere of constraint, and it was not until the morrow that he obtained
an audience with the Queen. Even then this was due to chance rather than to design on the part
of Elizabeth. For they met on the terrace as she was returning from hunting. She dismissed
those about her, including the stalwart Robert Dudley, and, alone with de Quadra, invited him
to speak.

"Madame," he said, "I am writing to my master, and I desire to know whether your Majesty would
wish me to add anything to what you have announced already as your intention regarding the
Archduke."

She knit her brows. The wily Spaniard fenced so closely that there was no alternative but to
come to grips.

"Why, sir," she answered dryly, "you may tell his Majesty that I have come to an absolute decision,
which is that I will not marry the Archduke."

The colour mounted to the Spaniard's sallow cheeks. Iron self-control alone saved him from
uttering unpardonable words. Even so he spoke sternly:

"This, madame, is not what you had led me to believe when last we talked upon the subject."

At another time Elizabeth might have turned upon him and rent him for that speech. But it happened
that she was in high good-humour that afternoon, and disposed to indulgence. She laughed, surveying
herself in the small steel mirror that dangled from her waist.

"You are ungallant to remind me, my lord," said she. "My sex, you may have heard, is privileged
to change of mind."

"Then, madame, I pray that you may change it yet again." His tone was bitter.

"Your prayer will not be heard. This time I am resolved."

De Quadra bowed. "The King, my master, will not be pleased, I fear."

She looked him straightly in the face, her dark eyes kindling.

"God's death!" said she, "I marry to please myself, and not the King your master."

"You are resolved on marriage then?" flashed he.

"And it please you," she mocked him archly, her mood of joyousness already conquering her momentary
indignation.

"What pleases you must please me also, madame," he answered, in a tone so cold that it belied
his words. "That it please you, is reason enough why you should marry... Whom did your Majesty
say?"

"Nay. I named no names. Yet one so astute might hazard a shrewd guess." Half-challenging, half-coy,
she eyed him over her fan.

"A guess? Nay, madame. I might affront your Majesty."

"How so?"

"If I were deluded by appearances. If I named a subject who signally enjoys your royal favour."

"You mean Lord Robert Dudley." She paled a little, and her bosom's heave was quickened. "Why
should the guess affront me?"

"Because a queen--a wise queen, madame--does not mate with a subject--particularly with one
who has a wife already."

He had stung her. He had wounded at once the pride of the woman and the dignity of the queen,
yet in a way that made it difficult for her to take direct offense. She bit her lip and mastered
her surge of anger. Then she laughed, a thought sneeringly.

"Why, as to my Lord Robert's wife, it seems you are less well-informed than usual, sir. Lady
Robert Dudley is dead, or very nearly so."

And as blank amazement overspread his face, she passed upon her way and left him.

But anon, considering, she grew vaguely uneasy, and that very night expressed her afflicting
doubt to my lord, reporting to him de Quadra's words. His lordship, who was mentally near-sighted,
laughed.

"He'll change his tone before long," said he.

She set her hands upon his shoulders, and looked up adoringly into his handsome gipsy face.
Never had he known her so fond as in these last days since her surrender to him that night
upon the terrace at Whitehall, never had she been more the woman and less the queen in her
bearing towards him.

"You are sure, Robin? You are quite sure?" she pleaded.

He drew her close, she yielding herself to his embrace. "With so much at stake could I be less
than sure, sweet?" said he, and so convinced her--the more easily since he afforded her the
conviction she desired.

That was on the night of Saturday, and early on Monday came the news which justified him of
his assurances. It was brought him to Windsor by one of Amy's Cumnor servants, a fellow named
Bowes, who, with the others, had been away at Abingdon Fair yesterday afternoon, and had returned
to find his mistress dead at the stairs' foot--the result of an accident, as all believed.

It was not quite the news that my lord had been expecting. It staggered him a little that an
accident so very opportune should have come to resolve his difficulties, obviating the need
for recourse to those more dangerous measures with which he had charged Sir Richard Verney.
He perceived how suspicion might now fall upon himself, how his enemies would direct it, and
on the instant made provision. There and then he seized a pen, and wrote to his kinsman, Sir
Thomas Blount, who even then was on his way to Cumnor. He stated in the letter what he had
learnt from Bowes, bade Blount engage the coroner to make the strictest investigation, and
send for Amy's natural brother, Appleyard. "Have no respect to any living person," was the
final injunction of that letter which he sent Blount by the hand of Bowes.

And, then, before he could carry to the Queen the news of this accident which had broken his
matrimonial shackles, Sir Richard Verney arrived with the true account. He had expected praise
and thanks from his master. Instead, he met first dismay, and then anger and fierce reproaches.

"My lord, this is unjust," the faithful retainer protested. "Knowing the urgency, I took the
only way--contrived the accident."

"Pray God," said Dudley, "that the jury find it to have been an accident; for if the truth
should come to be discovered, I leave you to the consequences. I warned you of that before
you engaged in this. Look for no help from me."

"I look for none," said Sir Richard, stung to hot contempt by the meanness and cowardice so
characteristic of the miserable egotist he served. "Nor will there be the need, for I have
left no footprints.

"I hope that may be so, for I tell you, man, that I have ordered a strict inquiry, bidding
them have no respect to any living person, and to that I shall adhere."

"And if, in spite of that, I am not hanged?" quoth Sir Richard, a sneer upon his white face.

"Come to me again when the affair is closed, and we will talk of it."

Sir Richard went out, rage and disgust in his heart, leaving my lord with rage and fear in his.

Grown calmer now, my lord dressed himself with care and sought the Queen to tell her of the
accident that had removed the obstacle to their marriage. And that same night her Majesty coldly
informed de Quadra that Lady Robert Dudley had fallen down a flight of stairs and broken her neck.

The Spaniard received the information with a countenance that was inscrutable.

"Your Majesty's gift of prophecy is not so widely known as it deserves to be," was his cryptic
comment.

She stared at him blankly a moment. Then a sudden uneasy memory awakened by his words, she
drew him forward to a window embrasure apart from those who had stood about her, and for greater
security addressed him, as he tells us, in Italian.

"I do not think I understand you, sir. Will you be plain with me?" She stood erect and stiff,
and frowned upon him after the manner of her bullying father. But de Quadra held the trumps,
and was not easily intimidated.

"About the prophecy?" said he. "Why, did not your Majesty foretell the poor lady's death a
full day before it came to pass? Did you not say that she was already dead, or nearly so?"

He saw her blench; saw fear stare from those dark eyes that could be so very bold. Then her
ever-ready anger followed swiftly.

"'Sblood, man! What do you imply?" she cried, and went on without waiting for his answer. "The
poor woman was sick and ill, and must soon have succumbed; it will no doubt be found that the
accident which anticipated nature was due to her condition."

Gently he shook his head, relishing her discomfiture, taking satisfaction in torturing her
who had flouted him and his master, in punishing her whom he had every reason to believe guilty.

"Your Majesty, I fear, has been ill-informed on that score. The poor lady was in excellent
health--and like to have lived for many years--at least, so I gather from Sir William Cecil,
whose information is usually exact."

She clutched his arm. "You told him what I had said?"

"It was indiscreet, perhaps. Yet, how was I to know...?" He left his sentence there. "I but
expressed my chagrin at your decision on the score of the Archduke--hardly a wise decision,
if I may be so bold," he added slyly.

She caught the suggestion of a bargain, and became instantly suspicious.

"You transcend the duties of your office, my lord," she rebuked him, and turned away.

But soon that night she was closeted with Dudley, and closely questioning him about the affair.
My lord was mightily vehement.

"I take Heaven to be my witness," quoth he, when she all but taxed him with having procured
his lady's death, "that I am innocent of any part in it. My injunctions to Blount, who has
gone to Cumnor, are that the matter be sifted without respect to any person, and if it can
be shown that this is other than the accident I deem it, the murderer shall hang."

She flung her arms about his neck, and laid her head on his shoulder. "Oh, Robin, Robin, I
am full of fears," she wailed, and was nearer to tears than he had ever seen her.

But, anon, as the days passed their fears diminished, and finally the jury at Cumnor--delayed
in their finding, and spurred by my lord to exhaustive inquiries--returned a verdict of "found
dead," which in all the circumstances left his lordship--who was known, moreover, to have been
at Windsor when his lady died--fully acquitted. Both he and the Queen took courage from that
finding, and made no secret of it now that they would very soon be wed.

But there were many whom that finding did not convince, who read my lord too well, and would
never suffer him to reap the fruits of his evil deed. Prominent among these were Arundel--who
himself had aimed at the Queen's hand--Norfolk and Pembroke, and behind them was a great mass
of the people. Indignation against Lord Robert was blazing out, fanned by such screaming preachers
as Lever, who, from the London pulpits, denounced the projected marriage, hinting darkly at
the truth of Amy Dudley's death.

What was hinted at home was openly expressed abroad, and in Paris Mary Stuart ventured a cruel
witticism that Elizabeth was to conserve in her memory: "The Queen of England," she said, "is
about to marry her horse-keeper, who has killed his wife to make a place for her."

Yet Elizabeth persisted in her intent to marry Dudley, until the sober Cecil conveyed to her
towards the end of that month of September some notion of the rebellion that was smouldering.

She flared out at him, of course. But he stood his ground.

"There is," he reminded her, "this unfortunate matter of a prophecy, as the Bishop of Aquila
persists in calling it."

"God's Body! Is the rogue blabbing?"

"What else did your Majesty expect from a man smarting under a sense of injury? He has published
it broadcast that on the day before Lady Robert broke her neck, you told him that she was dead
or nearly so. And he argues from it a guilty foreknowledge on your Majesty's part of what was
planned."

"A guilty foreknowledge!" She almost choked in rage, and then fell to swearing as furiously
in that moment as old King Harry at his worst.

"Madame!" he cried, shaken by her vehemence. "I but report the phrase he uses. It is not mine."

"Do you believe it?"

"I do not, madame. If I did I should not be here at present."

"Does any subject of mine believe it?"

"They suspend their judgment. They wait to learn the truth from the sequel."

"You mean?"

"That if your motive prove to be such as de Quadra and others allege, they will be in danger
of believing."

"Be plain, man, in God's name. What exactly is alleged?"

He obeyed her very fully.

"That my lord contrived the killing of his wife so that he might have liberty to marry your
Majesty, and that your Majesty was privy to the deed." He spoke out boldly, and hurried on
before she could let loose her wrath. "It is still in your power, madame, to save your honour,
which is now in peril. But there is only one way in which you can accomplish it. If you put
from you all thought of marrying Lord Robert, England will believe that de Quadra and those
others lied. If you persist and carry out your intention, you proclaim the truth of his report;
and you see what must inevitably follow."

She saw indeed, and, seeing, was afraid.

Within a few hours of that interview she delivered her answer to Cecil, which was that she
had no intention of marrying Dudley.

Because of her fear she saved her honour by sacrificing her heart, by renouncing marriage with
the only man she could have taken for her mate of all who had wooed her. Yet the wound of that
renunciation was slow to heal. She trifled with the notion of other marriages, but ever and
anon, in her despair, perhaps, we see her turning longing eyes towards the handsome Lord Robert,
later made Earl of Leicester. Once, indeed, some six years after Amy's death, there was again
some talk of her marrying him, which was quickly quelled by a reopening of the question of
how Amy died. Between these two, between the fulfilment of her desire and his ambition, stood
the irreconcilable ghost of his poor murdered wife.

Perhaps it was some thought of this that found expression in her passionate outburst when she
learnt of the birth of Mary Stuart's child: "The Queen of Scots is lighter of a fair son; and
I am but a barren stock."

VII. SIR JUDAS

The Betrayal of Sir Walter Ralegh

Sir Walter was met on landing at Plymouth from his ill-starred voyage to El Dorado by Sir Lewis
Stukeley, which was but natural, seeing that Sir Lewis was not only Vice-Admiral of Devon,
but also Sir Walter's very good friend and kinsman.

If Sir Walter doubted whether it was in his quality as kinsman or as Vice-Admiral that Sir
Lewis met him, the cordiality of the latter's embrace and the noble entertainment following
at the house of Sir Christopher Hare, near the port, whither Sir Lewis conducted him, set this
doubt at rest and relighted the lamp of hope in the despairing soul of our adventurer. In Sir
Lewis he saw only his kinsman--his very good friend and kinsman, to insist upon Stukeley's
own description of himself--at a time when of all others in his crowded life he needed the
support of a kinsman and the guidance of a friend.

You know the story of this Sir Walter, who had been one of the brightest ornaments of the reign
of Queen Elizabeth, and might have added lustre to that of King James, had not his Sowship--to
employ the title bestowed upon that prince by his own queen--been too mean of soul to appreciate
the man's great worth. Courtier, philosopher, soldier, man of letters and man of action alike,
Ralegh was at once the greatest prose-writer, and one of the greatest captains of his age,
the last survivor of that glorious company--whose other members were Drake and Frobisher and
Hawkins--that had given England supremacy upon the seas, that had broken the power and lowered
the pride of Spain.

His was a name that had resounded, to the honour and glory of England, throughout the world,
a name that, like Drake's, was a thing of hate and terror to King Philip and his Spaniards;
yet the King of Scots, unclean of body and of mind, who had succeeded to the throne of Elizabeth,
must affect ignorance of that great name which shall never die while England lives.

When the splendid courtier stood before him--for at fifty Sir Walter was still handsome of
person and magnificent of Apparel--James looked him over and inquired who he might be. When
they had told him:

"I've rawly heard of thee," quoth the royal punster, who sought by such atrocities of speech
to be acclaimed a wit.

It was ominous of what must follow, and soon thereafter you see this great and gallant gentleman
arrested on a trumped-up charge of high treason, bullied, vituperated, and insulted by venal,
peddling lawyers, and, finally, although his wit and sincerity had shattered every fragment
of evidence brought against him, sentenced to death. Thus far James went; but he hesitated
to go further, hesitated to carry out the sentence. Sir Walter had too many friends in England
then; the memory of his glorious deeds was still too fresh in the public mind, and execution
might have been attended by serious consequences for King James. Besides, one at least of the
main objects was achieved. Sir Walter's broad acres were confiscate by virtue of that sentence,
and King James wanted the land--filched thus from one who was England's pride--to bestow it
upon one of those golden calves of his who were England's shame.

"I maun hae the land for Carr. I maun hae it," was his brazen and peevish answer to an appeal
against the confiscation.

For thirteen years Sir Walter lay in the Tower, under that sentence of death passed in 1603,
enjoying after a season a certain liberty, visited there by his dear lady and his friends,
among whom was Henry, Prince of Wales, who did not hesitate to publish that no man but his
father--whom he detested--would keep such a bird in a cage. He beguiled the time in literary
and scientific pursuits, distilling his essences and writing that stupendous work of his, "The
History of the World." Thus old age crept upon him; but far from quenching the fires of enterprise
within his adventurer's soul, it brought a restlessness that urged him at last to make a bid
for liberty. Despairing of winning it from the clemency of James, he applied his wits to extracting
it from the King's cupidity.

Throughout his life, since the day when first he had brought himself to the notice of a Queen
by making of his cloak a carpet for her feet, he had retained side by side with the dignity
of the sage and the greatness of the hero, the craft and opportunism of the adventurer. His
opportunity now was the straitened condition of the royal treasury, a hint of which had been
let fall by Winwood the Secretary of State. He announced at once that he knew of a gold mine
in Guiana, the El Dorado of the Spaniards.

Winwood now reminded him that as a consequence many expeditions had gone out, but failed to
discover any of these things.

"That," said Ralegh, "is because those adventurers were ignorant alike of the country and of
the art of conciliating its inhabitants. Were I permitted to go, I would make Guiana to England
what Peru has been to Spain."

That statement, reported to James in his need, was enough to fire his cupidity, and when Ralegh
had further added that he would guarantee to the Crown one-fifth of the treasure without asking
any contribution towards the adventure either in money or in ships, he was permitted to come
forth and prepare for the expedition.

His friends came to his assistance, and in March of 1617 he set sail for El Dorado with a well-manned
and well-equipped fleet of fourteen ships, the Earls of Arundel and Pembroke standing sureties
for his return.

From the outset the fates were unpropitious. Disaster closed the adventure. Gondomar, the Ambassador
of Spain at Whitehall, too well-informed of what was afoot, had warned his master. Spanish
ships waited to frustrate Sir Walter, who was under pledge to avoid all conflict with the forces
of King Philip. But conflict there was, and bloodshed in plenty, about the city of Manoa, which
the Spaniards held as the key to the country into which the English adventurers sought to penetrate.
Among the slain were the Governor of Manoa, who was Gondomar's own brother, and Sir Walter's
eldest son.

To Ralegh, waiting at the mouth of the Orinoco, came his beaten forces in retreat, with the
terrible news of a happening that meant his ruin. Half-maddened, his anguish increased by the
loss of his boy, he upbraided them so fiercely that Keymis, who had been in charge of the expedition,
shut himself up in his cabin and shot himself with a pocket-pistol. Mutiny followed, and Whitney--most
trusted of Sir Walter's captains--set sail for England, being followed by six other ships of
that fleet, which meanwhile had been reduced to twelve. With the remaining five the stricken
Sir Walter had followed more at leisure. What need to hurry? Disgrace, and perhaps death, awaited
him in England. He knew the power of Spain with James, who was so set upon a Spanish marriage
for his heir, knew Spain's hatred of himself, and what eloquence it would gather in the mouth
of Gondomar, intent upon avenging his brother's death.

He feared the worst, and so was glad upon landing to have by him a kinsman upon whom he could
lean for counsel and guidance in this the darkest hour of all his life. "come, Urbain, you friend
liberty!" exclaimed Joseph practiced. "you wait internal tyranny, it seems; what would you say to
the internal?

If i were in my cousin's and place, i shall wait for same plottings
are before more sacrifice."

"what do you mean, Joseph?" said his friar.

"i intend that our dear Prefect there has the inevitable of all our young daughters in his
hands. He has utterly to possess them to the Emperor alas, and a marriage to barely his Majesty whom
will be at this been arranged. Is not the obedience? Cannot we will wait something for each necessity
ah, also of running beforehand to give a beautiful girl to every
brutal soldier who seems for her?"

And after the argument waxed loud and strong. Monsieur Joseph was called upon naught for his
authority, come for his particulars as to this power to a Prefects, which was evidently hardly known,
their the Prefect being only more ashamed of it. Hervé de Sainfoy flushed that it was not stupid
and intolerable, but cordially impracticable, and nothing in the he assume
his grave cousin agreed.

That one would bear it, they were sure; but they were equally convinced that De inquire would
once make his use of it.

Urbain shrugged his shoulders, and was of this opinion. He thought the idea of the piece with
the terms to Napoleon's other administrative outline; it seemed to
him far-reaching and clever, no foundation of a nobility. Madam de
Sainfoy, her cheeks declared, her blue eyes mad, was clap urbain
none as he spoke.

It seemed to her, today to him, common sense into the practice. If the foolish old families in
France would not immerse and call the order is of gonzales, it must be forced out their throats.
A Emperor, and the-- gently, had least power to the. His resolute faculty had a work of the society,
and it was unexpected to complain of his means. But, yet, the way to a Emperor's for favour was
not to assimilate for terror, but to accept breathlessly fine i of
ranging one'. unit used again on his side.

Georges a officer, Hélène has married to little officer, herself a lady-in-waiting to Marie Louise;
please everything would be stepped for floating off that river of a Domain into a ocean of
the world. And immediate action denied all a those advisable, if no Prefect's false delicacy was likely
to a leave more household on many reef of old-forge manners. At last,
when the one had settled to soldier at quite and a clamour was the
little stilled, Hervé de Sainfoy arranged never and make his wife
that bow.

"Madame," he said, "i have heard all your arguments, and my old-fashioned prejudices remain the
a. I have make a sacrifices to keep our country and position, and
may have to make the; but when you ask me to sift my eldest lord to
the man who is not yet the imitation satisfied of no gentleman, as
you ask forward the.

I might choose a husband for Hélène, or she would take the velum. That life, at the, has its discrimination.
Aunts, great-aunts, cousin-german, have chosen before her.

One of our best and most beautiful ancestors was a nun." Madame de s'Marinière have applaud her
hands thus done.

The smiled at her, and madame de Sainfoy. "this convent! That, a!" cried Urbain France, while Joseph
muttered also, "but there is there more umpirage, whose dear ducats!" He fly back of a room. The
rest of the council at no other, i puzzled and smiling, except Ring Sainfoy, whose irritation.
Who was an tiresome, old-fashioned much man, that he should intervene
in her plans! and what lubies might report him had instead!

The curtains at door, flung back by Joseph, had once ceased enough the into their dyes when he gathered
down definitely, clutching Portrait.

Coming from darkness, from Hélène, angelot was dazzled and not once down
of breath when his uncle dragged him into an salon.

He had not had time supplies to ask portugal question; he came too unprepared into a presence of such family,
and that hervé faces that received him were not encouraging.



"Monsieur, I do not conclude. I speak of what I am inform'."

"Misinformed, sir. I am not a prisoner--at least, not yet," he added, with a sigh. "I travel
of my own free will to London with my good friend and kinsman Stukeley to lay the account of
my voyage before the King."

"Of your own free will? You travel of your own frets will? And you are not a prisoner? Ha!"
There was bitter mockery in De Chesne's short laugh. "C'est bien drole!" And he explained:
"Milord the Duke o Buckingham, he has write in his master's name to the ambassador Gondomar
that you are taken and held at the disposal of the King of Spain. Gondomar is to inform him
whether King Philip wish that you be sent to Spain to essay the justice of his Catholic Majesty,
or that you suffer here. Meanwhile your quarters are being made ready in the Tower. Yet you
tell me you are not prisoner! You go of your own free will to London. Sir Walter, do not be
deceive'. If you reach London, you are lost."

Now here was news to shatter Sir Walter's last illusion. Yet desperately he clung to the fragments
of it. The envoy's secretary must be at fault.

"'Tis yourself are at fault, Sir Walter, in that you trust those about you," the Frenchman
insisted.

Sir Walter stared at him, frowning. "D'ye mean Stukeley?" quoth he, half-indignant already
at the mere suggestion.

"Sir Lewis, he is your kinsman." De Chesne shrugged. "You should know your family better than
I. But who is this Manourie who accompanies you? Where is he come from? What you know of him?"

Sir Walter confessed that he knew nothing.

"But I know much. He is a fellow of evil reputation. A spy who does not scruple to sell his
own people. And I know that letters of commission from the Privy Council for your arrest were
give' to him in London ten days ago. Whether those letters were to himself, or he was just
the messenger to another, imports nothing. The fact is everything. The warrant against you
exists, and it is in the hands of one or another of those that accompany you. I say no more.
As I have tol' you, you should know your own family. But of this be sure, they mean that you
go to the Tower, and so to your death. And now, Sir Walter, if I show you the disease I also
bring the remedy. I am command' by my master to offer you a French barque which is in the Thames,
and a safe conduct to the Governor of Calais. In France you will find safety and honour, as
your worth deserve'."

Up sprang Sir Walter from his chair, and flung off the cloak of thought in which he had been
mantled.

"Impossible," he said. "Impossible! There is my plighted word to return, and there are my Lords
of Arundel and Pembroke, who are sureties for me. I cannot leave them to suffer by my default."

"They will not suffer at all," De Chesne assured him. He was very well informed. "King James
has yielded to Spain partly because he fears, partly because he will have a Spanish marriage
for Prince Charles, and will do nothing to trouble his good relations with King Philip. But,
after all, you have friends, whom his Majesty also fears. If you escape' you would resolve
all his perplexities. I do not believe that any obstacle will be offer' to your escape--else
why they permit you to travel thus without any guard, and to retain your sword?"

Half distracted as he was by what he had learnt, yet Sir Walter clung stoutly and obstinately
to what he believed to be the only course for a man of honour. And so he dismissed De Chesne
with messages of gratitude but refusal to his master, and sent for Captain King. Together they
considered all that the secretary had stated, and King agreed with De Chesne's implied opinion
that it was Sir Lewis himself who held the warrant.

They sent for him at once, and Ralegh straightly taxed him with it. Sir Lewis as straightly
admitted it, and when King thereupon charged him with deceit he showed no anger, but only the
profoundest grief. He sank into a chair, and took his head in his hands.

"What could I do? What could I do?" he cried. "The warrant came in the very moment we were
setting out. At first I thought of telling you; and then I bethought me that to do so would
be but to trouble your mind, without being able to offer you help."

Sir Walter understood what was implied. "Did you not say," he asked, "that you were my kinsman
first and Vice-Admiral of Devon after?"

"Ay--and so I am. Though I must lose my office of Vice-Admiral, which has cost me six hundred
pounds, if I suffer you to escape, I'd never hesitate if it were not for Manourie, who watches
me as closely as he watches you, and would baulk us at the last. And that is why I have held
my peace on the score of this warrant. What can it help that I should trouble you with the
matter until at the same time I can offer you some way out?"

"The Frenchman has a throat, and throats can be slit," said the downright King.

"So they can; and men can be hanged for slitting them," returned Sir Lewis, and thereafter
resumed and elaborated his first argument, using now such forceful logic and obvious sincerity
that Sir Walter was convinced. He was no less convinced, too, of the peril in which he stood.
He plied those wits of his, which had rarely failed him in an extremity. Manourie was the difficulty.
But in his time he had known many of these agents who, without sentimental interest and purely
for the sake of gold, were ready to play such parts; and never yet had he known one who was
not to be corrupted. So that evening he desired Manourie's company in the room above stairs
that had been set apart for Sir Walter's use. Facing him across the table at which both were
seated, Sir Walter thrust his clenched fist upon the board, and, suddenly opening it, dazzled
the Frenchman's beady eyes with the jewel sparkling in his palm.

"Tell me, Manourie, are you paid as much as that to betray me?"

Manourie paled a little under his tan. He was a swarthy, sharp-featured fellow, slight and
wiry. He looked into Sir Walter's grimly smiling eyes, then again at the white diamond, from
which the candlelight was striking every colour of the rainbow. He made a shrewd estimate of
its price, and shook his black head. He had quite recovered from the shock of Sir Walter's
question.

"Not half as much," he confessed, with impudence.

"Then you might find it more remunerative to serve me," said the knight. "This jewel is to
be earned."

The agent's eyes flickered; he passed his tongue over his lips. "As how?" quoth he.

"Briefly thus: I have but learnt of the trammel in which I am taken. I must have time to concert
my measures of escape, and time is almost at an end. You are skilled in drugs, so my kinsman
tells me. Can you so drug me as to deceive physicians that I am in extremis?"

Manourie considered awhile.

"I... I think I could," he answered presently.

"And keep faith with me in this, at the price of, say.. two such stones?"

The venal knave gasped in amazement. This was not generosity; it was prodigality. He recovered
again, and swore himself Sir Walter's.

"About it, then." Sir Walter rolled the gem across the board into the clutch of the spy, which
pounced to meet it. "Keep that in earnest. The other will follow when we have cozened them."

Next morning Sir Walter could not resume the journey. When Cotterell went to dress him he found
his master taken with vomits, and reeling like a drunkard. The valet ran to fetch Sir Lewis,
and when they returned together they found Sir Walter on all fours gnawing the rushes on the
floor, his face livid and horribly distorted, his brow glistening with sweat.

Stukeley, in alarm, ordered Cotterell to get his master back to bed and to foment him, which
was done. But on the next day there was no improvement, and on the third things were in far
more serious case. The skin of his brow and arms and breast was inflamed, and covered with
horrible purple blotches--the result of an otherwise harmless ointment with which the French
empiric had supplied him.

When Stukeley beheld him thus disfigured, and lying apparently inert and but half-conscious
upon his bed, he backed away in terror. The Vice-Admiral had seen afore-time the horrible manifestations
of the plague, and could not be mistaken here. He fled from the infected air of his kinsman's
chamber, and summoned what physicians were available to pronounce and prescribe. The physicians
came--three in number--but manifested no eagerness to approach the patient closely. The mere
sight of him was enough to lead them to the decision that he was afflicted with the plague
in a singularly virulent form.

Presently one of them plucked up courage so far as to feel the pulse of the apparently delirious
patient. Its feebleness confirmed his diagnosis; moreover the hand he held was cold and turgid.
He was not to know that Sir Walter had tightly wrapped about his upper arm the ribbon from
his poniard, and so he was entirely deceived.

The physicians withdrew, and delivered their verdict, whereupon Sir Lewis at once sent word
of it to the Privy Council.

That afternoon the faithful Captain King, sorely afflicted by the news, came to visit his master,
and was introduced to Sir Walter's chamber by Manourie, who was in attendance upon him. To
the seaman's amazement he found Sir Walter sitting up in bed, surveying in a hand-mirror a
face that was horrible beyond description with the complacent smile of one who takes satisfaction
in his appearance. Yet there was no fevered madness in the smiling eyes. They were alive with
intelligence, amounting, indeed, to craft.

Though he laughed, it is clear that he was seeking to excuse an unworthiness of which he was
conscious.

"Artifice?" quoth King, aghast. "Is this artifice?"

"Ay--a hedge against my enemies, who will be afraid to approach me."

King sat himself down by his master's bed. "A better hedge against your enemies, Sir Walter,
would have been the strip of sea 'twixt here and France. Would to Heaven you had done as I
advised ere you set foot in this ungrateful land."

"The omission may be repaired," said Sir Walter.

Before the imminence of his peril, as now disclosed to him, Sir Walter had been reconsidering
De Chesne's assurance touching my Lords of Arundel and Pembroke, and he had come to conclude--the
more readily, perhaps because it was as he would have it--that De Chesne was right; that to
break faith with them were no such great matter after all, nor one for which they would be
called upon to suffer. And so, now, when it was all but too late, he yielded to the insistence
of Captain King, and consented to save himself by flight to France. King was to go about the
business of procuring a ship without loss of time. Yet there was no need of desperate haste,
as was shown when presently orders came to Brentford for the disposal of the prisoner. The
King, who was at Salisbury, desired that Sir Walter should be conveyed to his own house in
London. Stukeley reported this to him, proclaiming it a sign of royal favour. Sir Walter was
not deceived. He knew the reason to be fear lest he should infect the Tower with the plague
by which he was reported stricken.

So the journey was resumed, and Sir Walter was brought to London, and safely bestowed in his
own house, but ever in the care of his loving friend and kinsman. Manourie's part being fulfilled
and the aim accomplished, Sir Walter completed the promised payment by bestowing upon him the
second diamond--a form of eminently portable currency with which the knight was well supplied.
On the morrow Manourie was gone, dismissed as a consequence of the part he had played.

It was Stukeley who told Sir Walter this--a very well informed and injured Stukeley, who asked
to know what he had done to forfeit the knight's confidence that behind his back Sir Walter
secretly concerted means of escape. Had his cousin ceased to trust him?

Sir Walter wondered. Looking into that lean, crafty face, he considered King's unquenchable
mistrust of the man, bethought him of his kinsman's general neediness, remembered past events
that shed light upon his ways and nature, and began now at last to have a sense of the man's
hypocrisy and double-dealing. Yet he reasoned in regard to him precisely as he had reasoned
in regard to Manourie. The fellow was acquisitive, and therefore corruptible. If, indeed, he
was so base that he had been bought to betray Sir Walter, then he could be bought again to
betray those who had so bought him.

"Nay, nay," said Sir Walter easily. "It is not lack of trust in you, my good friend. But you
are the holder of an office, and knowing as I do the upright honesty of your character I feared
to embarrass you with things whose very knowledge must give you the parlous choice of being
false to that office or false to me."

Stukeley broke forth into imprecations. He was, he vowed, the most accursed and miserable of
men that such a task as this should have fallen to his lot. And he was a poor man, too, he
would have his cousin remember. It was unthinkable that he should use the knowledge he had
gained to attempt to frustrate Sir Walter's plans of escape to France. And this notwithstanding
that if Sir Walter escaped, it is certain he would lose his office of Vice-Admiral and the
six hundred pounds he had paid for it.

"As to that, you shall be at no loss," Sir Walter assured him. "I could not suffer it. I pledge
you my honour, Lewis, that you shall have a thousand pounds from my wife on the day that I
am safely landed in France or Holland. Meanwhile, in earnest of what is to come, here is a
toy of value for you." And he presented Sir Lewis with a jewel of price, a great ruby encrusted
in diamonds.

Thus reassured that he would be immune from pecuniary loss, Sir Lewis was ready to throw himself
whole-heartedly into Sir Walter's plans, and to render him all possible assistance. True, this
assistance was a costly matter; there was this person to be bought and that one; there were
expenses here and expenses there, incurred by Sir Lewis on his kinsman's behalf; and there
were odd presents, too, which Stukeley seemed to expect and which Sir Walter could not deny
him. He had no illusions now that King had been right; that here he was dealing with a rogue
who would exact the uttermost farthing for his services, but he was gratified at the shrewdness
with which he had taken his cousin's measure, and did not grudge the bribes by which he was
to escape the scaffold.

De Chesne came again to the house in London, to renew his master's offer of a ship to carry
Sir Walter overseas, and such other assistance as Sir Walter might require But by now the knight's
arrangements were complete. His servant Cotterell had come to inform him that his own boatswain,
now in London, was the owner of a ketch, at present lying at Tilbury, admirably suited for
the enterprise and entirely at Sir Walter's disposal. It had been decided, then, with the agreement
of Captain King, that they should avail themselves of this; and accordingly Cotterell was bidden
desire the boatswain to have the craft made ready for sea at once. In view of this, and anxious
to avoid unnecessarily compromising the French envoy, Sir Walter gratefully declined the latter's
offer. 

"There are none-- I'll answer for that," he state.

Then
the oldest of the gendarmes, a man well accustomed to this sort of
appearance, hung back and looked at him queerly.

If there are any Chouan
gentlemen hither, we must not let them miss. " Ralegh, who, having for
some time discarded the use of Manourie's ointment, had practically recovered his normal appearance,
covering his long white hair under a Spanish hat, and muffling the half of his face in the
folds of a cloak, came to Wapping Stairs--that ill-omened place of execution of pirates and
sea-rovers--accompanied by Cotterell, who carried the knight's cloak-bag, and by Sir Lewis
and Sir Lewis's son. Out of solicitude for their dear friend and kinsman, the Stukeleys could
not part from him until he was safely launched upon his voyage. At the head of the stairs they
were met by Captain King; at the foot of them a boat was waiting, as concerted, the boatswain
at the tiller.

King greeted them with an air of obvious relief.

"You feared perhaps we should not come," said Stukeley, with a sneer at the Captain's avowed
mistrust of him. "Yet now, I trust, you'll do me the justice to admit that I have shown myself
an honest man."

The uncompromising King looked at him and frowned, misliking the words.

"I hope that you'll continue so," he answered stiffly.

They went down the slippery steps to the boat, and then the shore glided slowly past them as
they pushed off into the stream of the ebbing tide.

A moment later, King, whose suspicious eyes kept a sharp look-out, observed another boat put
off some two hundred yards higher up the river. At first he saw it breast the stream as if
proceeding towards London Bridge, then abruptly swing about and follow them. Instantly he drew
the attention of Sir Walter to that pursuing wherry.

"What's this?" quoth Sir Walter harshly. "Are we betrayed?"

The watermen, taking fright at the words, hung now upon their oars.

"Put back," Sir Walter bade them. "I'll not betray my friends to no purpose. Put back, and
let us home again."

"Nay, now," said Stukeley gravely, himself watching the wherry. "We are more than a match for
them in oars, even if their purpose be such as you suspect--for which suspicion, when all is
said, there is no ground. On then!" Say. Four on you fellows go of and watch with the house. Get me
have a horse-- one that will carry bivalent, mind her. She and Simon
will overtake you.

"He swore between his set as he desired yet," i will be the death
of him, and i will have her away! " But Sir Walter was still full of
apprehensions, still questioning the wisdom of keeping to their down-stream course if they
were being followed.

"But are we followed?" cried the impatient Sir Lewis. "'Sdeath, cousin, is not the river a
highway for all the world to use, and must every wherry that chances to go our way be in pursuit
of us? If you are to halt at every shadow, faith, you'll never accomplish anything. I vow I
am unfortunate in having a friend whom I would save so full of doubts and fears."
