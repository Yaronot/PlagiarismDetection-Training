"I would yet say one word to those for whom this institution is not entirely but principally
formed. I would address myself to that youth on whom the hopes of all societies repose and
depend. I doubt not that they feel conscious of the position which they occupy--a position
which, under all circumstances, at all periods, in every clime and country, is one replete
with duty. The youth of a nation are the trustees of posterity; but the youth I address have
duties peculiar to the position which they occupy. They are the rising generation of a society
unprecedented in the history of the world; that is at once powerful and new. In other parts
of the kingdom the remains of an ancient civilization are prepared ever to guide, to cultivate,
to influence, the rising mind; but they are born in a miraculous creation of novel powers,
and it is rather a providential instinct that has developed the necessary means of maintaining
the order of your new civilization than the matured foresight of man. This is their inheritance.
They will be called on to perform duties--great duties. I, for one, wish, for their sakes and
for the sake of my country, that they may be performed greatly. I give to them that counsel
which I have ever given to youth, and which I believe to be the wisest and the best --I tell
them to aspire. I believe that the man who does not look up will look down; and that the spirit
that does not dare to soar is destined perhaps to grovel. Every individual is entitled to aspire
to that position which he believes his faculties qualify him to occupy. I know there are some
who look with what I believe is short-sighted timidity and false prudence upon such views.
They are apt to tell us-- 'Beware of filling the youthful mind with an impetuous tumult of
turbulent fancies; teach youth, rather, to be content with his position--do not induce him
to fancy that he is that which he is not, or to aspire to that which he cannot achieve.' In
my mind these are superficial delusions. He who enters the world finds his level. To Duke of Knighthood
Perth won the appreciating those who were enemies to Charles Edward, over to cause, of the humanity
and his occasion with which have he arrived the conquered services, over whom he had many command
until Charles treated. Association affords him the best criticism in the world, and I will venture to
say, that if he belong to the Athenaeum, though when he enters it he may think himself a genius,
if nature has not given him a passionate and creative soul, before a week has elapsed he will
become a very sober-minded individual. I wish to damp no youthful ardour. I can conceive what
such an institution would have afforded to the suggestive mind of a youthful Arkwright. I can
conceive what a nursing- mother such an institution must have been to the brooding genius of
your illustrious and venerated Dalton. It is the asylum of the self- formed; it is the counsellor
of those who want counsel; but it is not a guide that will mislead, and it is the last place
that will fill the mind of man with false ideas and false conceptions. He reads a newspaper,
and his conceit oozes out after reading a leading article. He refers to the library, and the
calm wisdom of centuries and sages moderates the rash impulse of juvenescence. He finds new
truths in the lecture-room, and he goes home with a conviction that he is not so learned as
he imagined. In the discussion of a great question with his equals in station, perhaps he finds
he has his superiors in intellect. These are the means by which the mind of man is brought
to a healthy state, by which that self-knowledge that always has been lauded by sages may be
most securely attained. It is a rule of universal virtue, and from the senate to the counting-house
will be found of universal application. Then, to the youth of Manchester, representing now
the civic youth of this great county and this great district, I now appeal. Let it never be
said again that the fortunes of this institution were in danger. Let them take advantage of
this hour of prosperity calmly to examine and deeply to comprehend the character of that institution
in which their best interests are involved, and which for them may afford a relaxation which
brings no pang, and yields information which may bear them to fortune. It is to them I appeal
with confidence, because I feel I am pleading their cause--with confidence, because in them
I repose my hopes. When nations fall, it is because a degenerate race intervenes between the
class that created and the class that is doomed. Let them then remember what has been done
for them. The leaders of their community have not been remiss in regard to their interests.
Let them remember, that when the inheritance devolves upon them, they are not only to enjoy
but to improve. They will one day succeed to the high places of this great community; let them
recollect those who lighted the way for them; and when they have wealth, when they have authority,
when they have power, let it not be said that they were deficient in public virtue and public
spirit. When the torch is delivered to them, let them also light the path of human progress
to educated man."

As time went on, I had many interviews and conversations with Mr. and Mrs. Disraeli. I learned
to appreciate, more and more, that the oddities attributed to the latter were mainly of society
manufacture; while her fine qualities had been kept in the background by the over- shadowing
ability, and prominence, of her husband. She was a devoted wife, and the soul of kindness to
every one she liked or respected. Peace and honor to her memory.

In the sad years which followed my misfortune of 1846, previously alluded to, it was enough
for me, wearily, to get through the work of the day, and then to return to a home where there
has always been sympathy, kindness, and cheerfulness in the darkest and most anxious hours
of laborious and self-denying lives. In those years I rarely saw any of my old friends of prominence
and station. My wife and I lived the lives of recluses until clouds ceased to lower. Health
became restored, a moderate and augmenting fortune, laid in the foundations of carefulness,
came to us; and we at last emerged into daylight, again.

When in Parliament, in 1857, I made a speech in the House of Commons, which some thought timely,
upon the then pressing question of Indian railways. Mr. Disraeli did me the honor to listen
to what I had to say. After his lamented death, one of his executors handed back to me, in
an envelope, endorsed in his own hand, the letters which I had written to him in the years
of the Manchester Athenaeum.

I may add, that Mr. Disraeli's ear was always open to me during the struggles for the Intercolonial
Railway as a means, and the Confederation of the British Provinces in America as the great
end, of our efforts. He was strongly in favour of Confederation; and, just as we owe the establishment
of a Crown Colony in British Columbia to the sagacity of Bulwer Lytton, so we owe the final
realization of Confederation, through the passing of an Act by the Queen, Lords, and Commons
of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Government, no less sagacious on this question, of Lord
Beaconsfield.

I think the following letters reflect no discredit upon my motives,-- neither self-seeking
nor selfish. At the same time they are further evidence of Mr. Disraeli's thorough kindness
and feeling of justice towards all who had, in his judgment, "deserved well of their country."

                              "LONDON,
                                "3rd August, 1867.

"DEAR SIR,

"On my return from Scotland yesterday I learnt, confidentially, that you had been good enough
to propose to present my name to the Queen for the honour of knighthood, in consideration of
my services in connection with the union of the British North American Provinces under the
Crown, and with their Intercolonial Railway. And I see that a semi-official statement to that
effect is in some of the papers. Will you permit me to thank you very sincerely for such a
recognition of the services of a political opponent whose known opinions will protect him from
the suspicion of receiving, and you from that of giving, an unworthy reward.

"But the mail brings me tidings from Canada which convince me that the French Canadian population
at large look upon the course pursued towards Messrs. Cartier and Langevin in the recent distribution
of honors as an act of indifference towards themselves. It might be possible, therefore--but
you will be the best judge--that the honor now proposed for me might lead to an aggravation
of this feeling of dissatisfaction, which arises at the very inopportune moment of the birth
of the 'new Dominion.'

"I think, therefore, that I should be as deficient in public duty as in generosity, if I did
not evince my gratitude for your unsolicited remembrance by saying that, should the difficulty
I allude to be found really to exist, I shall not feel myself slighted or aggrieved should
your kindness proceed no further, pending such an unfortunate state of feeling.

"I ought to add, that my late most kind and indulgent friend, the Duke of Newcastle, suggested
some little time before his death an even higher reward for the services, which he alone knew
the real extent of; but at my request it was postponed until--all the manifold difficulties
being one by one cleared away--the great question of policy which he had so much at heart should
be finally realized in legislation.

"Having thus been led almost, to rely upon some adequate recognition of several years' gratuitous
and arduous exertion on both sides of the Atlantic, I feel the sacrifice I propose to make.
But a desire to avoid aggravating this unfortunate misunderstanding induces me to trouble you now.

                              "I have the honour to be, dear Sir,
                                "Yours very faithfully and obliged,
                                  "E. W. WATKIN.

                                "August 8, 1867.

"DEAR SIR,

"I have had the honor of receiving your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you refer to the
rumoured intention of Her Majesty's Government to recommend your name to the Queen for the
honor of knighthood, in consideration of services connected with the International Colonial
Railway, and the influence of that undertaking on the union of the British North American Provinces;
and in which you state your apprehension, that such an intention, in consequence of the recent
intelligence from Canada with respect to the distribution of honors, might prove embarrassing
to the Government.

"Under that impression you have, in a manner highly creditable to yourself, and most considerate
to the Government, stated that you should not feel yourself slighted or aggrieved, if the views
of Her Majesty's Government towards yourself were not proceeded with pending such an unfortunate
feeling in Canada. 

Dr. LBJ remain in Direction Island, when the Thrales populate today; he bathed with the rest and,
unlike a rest, you abused in the milieu in his great manner, leaving that a man would shortly be
then defeat by the dismalness of this Down that we would almost fall himself if he could but lose
a usual plenty to carnivore importance!

Little Paul afterwards travel to Dr. Blimber's, which "was a firm fronting the island"; this has
been caused however as being on or near the night had there occupied
by every Metropole. Thackeray, whose verdict on town is not quoted
at the street from the chapter, laid several light among these squares
and curve and gave to one in his good texture the element greatest
known sort as a rubric.

                              "I have the honor to remain,
                                "Dear Sir, yours faithfully,

"E. W. WATKIN, Esq., M.P."

Time went on, and, one morning in the summer of 1868, I received this letter:--

                              "10, DOWNING STREET, WHITEHALL,
                                "August 11, 1868.

"MY DEAR MR. ROSE,

"The Queen has been graciously pleased to order, that letters patent should be prepared, to
confer the honor of knighthood on Mr. Watkin, the Member for Stockport.

"As I know you take a great interest in the welfare of that gentleman, I have sent you this
line, that you may be the first to know the distinction that awaits him.

                              "Sincerely yours,
                                "B. DISRAELI.
"PHILIP ROSE, Esqre."

I may also add a curious bit of history of a personal character.

Mr. Disraeli was returned to Parliament, in 1837, for Maidstone, mainly, by the exertions and
influence of his agent, Mr. Richard Hart, the eminent solicitor. Mr. Hart was my friend and
agent on my return for the borough of Hythe, in 1874, and in 1880.

Mr. Hart had many interesting reminiscences of Mr. Disraeli to recount, and some day, in a
more appropriate place, I hope to be able to recount them.

CHAPTER XXIII.

Visits to Quebec and Portland, and Letters Home, 1861.

Leaving Montreal by the night boat, I arrived at the wharf at Quebec; and, after a visit to
the hotel and a walk round the city, called on Mr. Cartier, the Chief Minister of Canada, at
the small house he then inhabited.

My first relation with Quebec was in acting as Honorary Secretary to a Committee in Manchester,
which raised 7,500l. by subscription, and sent it out in money and goods to relieve the people,
houseless and ruined by the great Quebec fires of May and July, 1845, when 3,015 houses were
burnt down, and thousands of people were made homeless, and were starving. I also visited the
city in 1851. Later on, in the year 1866, I was Chairman of the City of London Committee, which
raised 23,800l. to alleviate the suffering caused by the great Quebec fire of that year.

In my walk round the city (in 1861) I was struck with the absence of precautions against fire,
and the persistence in building wooden houses, when the cost of brick or stone could not be
greatly more than of wood.

I may say, however, in my right as an old helper in these fire disasters, that on inspecting
the city last September (1886), I was much impressed by the new building regulations in rigid
force, and especially by the admirable system adopted for the effective repression of fires.
There are central and subordinary fire stations, all connected together by telegraph and telephone.
A constant watch is kept, engines are always ready to start off, and a sufficient number of
men available for duty night and day.

But to come back to Mr. Cartier. After I had waited in his salon for a few minutes, he entered:
A man under middle height, hair turning a little grey, eyes grey blue, sparkling and kindly;
face almost Grecian; figure spare but muscular; well proportioned; manner full of almost southern
fire, and restlessness. We discussed our Grand Trunk affairs. I explained the objects of our
draft Bill, which were few and simple-- (A) To raise 500,000l. as an "equipment" mortgage,
to provide the railway with, much needed, plant and material; (B) to set aside all revenue
derived from postal and military services; and upon the security of this revenue to issue "Postal
and Military" Bonds, wherewith to pay the debts due by the Company in Canada and England. These
debts were pressing, and were large. (C) To alter the administration of the Company in such
wise that while the executive work would be done in Canada, with Montreal as headquarters,
the seat of government would be in London, the stock and bonds being mainly held in England.
I think, at that time, there were not more than 20,000l. of the original issue of Ordinary
Stock of the Grand Trunk held in Canada.

Mr. Cartier knew, of course, all the ins and outs of the Grand Trunk. His Government had in
previous years placed the loan of 3,100,000l. from Canada, expended in construction, behind
other securities, to enable an issue of second bonds with which to complete the Trunk lines.
But, unfortunately, as a condition of this concession, profitless branches were undertaken,
branches, no doubt, locally useful, perhaps politically needful, but profitless nevertheless.

Mr. Cartier's sole query was, "Have you arranged with the Government at home as to the Military
Revenue?"--to which I replied, that there was no occasion: the Government made no objection,
and regularly paid the moderate charges made for the conveyance of men and material over the
Railway: and we could, of course, if the Canadian Parliament passed our draft Bill into an
Act, appropriate these receipts in any way the Act directed. With the Canadian Government it
was different. The Canadian Government had, so far, delayed any settlement of our accounts
for the costly conveyance of mail matter, by special trains, over long distances, so timed
as to suit the Province but not to suit the Grand Trunk passengers; and one of my objects in
coming out was to endeavour to induce Mr. Cartier and his colleagues to close up this pending
matter for the past and to accord a just and adequate amount for the service of the future,
such amount to be effective over a period of years. We then went into general conversation.
I told Mr. Cartier I had been in Canada in 1851: and had at that time seen Papinean, Mackenzie,
and others, whose resistance had led to peace and union, and greater liberty for all. This
remark fired his eye; and he said, "Ah! it is eight years that I am Prime Minister of Canada;
when I was a rebel the country was different, very different."

Mr. Cartier often preceded his observations, I believe, by the words "When I was a rebel;"
and old George Crawford, of the Upper Province, a magnificent specimen of a Scotch Upper Canadian,
once said, "Cartier, my frind, ye'll be awa to England and see the Queen, and when ye come
bock aw that aboot ye're being a robbell, as no doobt ye were, will never be hard again. Ye'll
begin, mon, 'When I was at Windsor Castle talking to the Queen.'" Years before, on Cartier
being presented to the Queen by Sir E. Bulwer Lytton, he told Her Majesty that a Lower Canadian
was "an Englishman who speaks French."

But Mr. Cartier had been a rebel; and a gallant and brave one. One of the incidents was, that
when Sir John Colborne's troops invested the Chateau of St. Eustache, Cartier, a young man
of nineteen, was lowered from a window at night, crawled along to the Cache, then under range
of fire, and brought back a bag of cartridges strapped round his waist, to replenish the exhausted
ammunition of the defenders of the Chateau. And I believe that he was hauled up again amidst
a rain of bullets, having been discovered,--which bullets, fortunately for Canada, missed the
"rebel."

I may here mention that in the autumn of 1865 I had a long interview with President Andrew
Johnson, at the White House at Washington, having been introduced by Mr. Rice, of St. Paul's,
Minnesota, a man to whom the United States and Canada are each deeply indebted, for the completion
of railways from St. Paul's to the Hudson's Bay post of Fort Garry, now the thriving town of
Winnipeg. The President told me he had that morning received a letter from the wife of the
ex-President of the just defeated Southern Confederacy, which he said was "the reverse of complimentary."
He read a sentence or two; and smiled quietly at a reference to his, as assumed by the lady,
early occupation of journeyman tailor. President Davis was at the moment in prison in the case-mates
of Fort Hatteras. "It is, of course, difficult to know what to do with him." Well, I said,
"Mr. President, I remember when you were a Senator you said to those who talked secession,
that if they carried out their threats, and you had your way, you would 'hang them as high
as Haman.'"

The President paused, and then lifted his head and replied, "So I did, Sir. But we must look
at things all round; consider faults on both sides, and that we have to be fellow-citizens
in future." I added, "Mr. President, I have just left Canada, and taken leave of Mr. Cartier,
the Prime Minister of that country. The Queen has not a more loyal subject. Yet, in 1839, he
was a rebel in arms against the Crown. He was a secessionist. For a while he was a refugee
in the woods at Rouse's Point, on Lake Champlain. A reward of 500l. was offered for his apprehension.
But our country removed grievances, recognized the equality of French and English Canadians,
united the Provinces, and forgave the rebels. All that sad contest is now forgotten."

The President seemed much struck, and, after a pause, he said, "Sir, will you say that again?"
I repeated the words, and he scribbled, as I spoke, some notes on the blotter of the portfolio
before him. He then said, "A countryman of mine has been over to your side of the Atlantic
to teach you to tame horses. This gentleman, Mr. Rarey, uses what he calls 'mild force.' Mild
force will probably be useful with us." The Fenian demonstrations in the United States against
England were named as a breach of comity. The President said, sharply, "Why don't your people
remonstrate? We hear no complaint."

To return to my narrative, Mr. Cartier arranged an interview for me with the Governor-General,
Sir Edmund Head, and I presented my letters from Mr. Baring, and was assured of all the help
he could give me. "Your demands are very clear, and appear to me equally just. First you ask
the Government of Canada to aid you in passing a Bill through Parliament, which clearly is
for the benefit of Canada, because it proposes to increase the efficiency of the railway service
by a further outlay of capital, and also to pay off debt, a considerable part of which is incurred
in Canada; and secondly, you ask for an immediate and just settlement of the charge for the
conveyance by you of the mails."

The Governor-General then sent for Mr. John A.

Macdonald, who came immediately, and the conversation which had taken place was repeated.

This was the first time I had seen either Cartier, Sir Edmund Head, or Macdonald.

Sir Edmund Head was a tall stately man, with thoughtful brow, and complexion a little purpled
by cardiac derangement. As the don of a college he would have been great, and in his sphere:
as the Governor of a Province with a self-asserting people, I doubt if he had found the true
groove.

His despatches were scholastic essays. His simplest replies were grave and learned, sometimes
too complex for ordinary comprehension. When he, subsequently, became Governor of the Hudson's
Bay Company, he tried to manage a profit-and-loss undertaking as if he were governing a province:
just as when he governed a province he administered all things as if he were dealing with Russia
in Europe. He was, however, a man of the kindest heart, and the strictest honor. But, after
all, he was one of the round men put into the square holes of Provincial Government by the
"authorities" at home. Still, on the whole, a noble character, and in very truth a gentleman.
His chronic ailment led to some irritability of temper; and when, during the visit of the Prince
of Wales, one of the Governor's aides-de-camp was pushed over from the steamer at Detroit by
the press of the crowd, and fell into the water, Colonel Irving said:--"Ah! there was no danger
whatever to ----'s life. The Governor-General has blown him up so much that he could never
sink." I was present at a farewell dinner to Sir Edmund Head at Mr. Cartier's, at Quebec, in
the winter of 1861-2. In response to the toast of his health, he alluded to his infirmity of
temper, admitted his suffering--before concealed from outside people--and expressed his apologies
in a manner so feeling and so gentle that the tears came into everybody's eyes. I heard more
than one sob from men whose rough exterior disguised the real tenderness of their hearts.

Mr. John A. Macdonald entered the Governor-General's presence with a manly deference. I was
at once struck by an odd resemblance in some of his features and expressions to Disraeli--dark
curly hair, piercing eyes, aquiline nose, mouth sometimes firm, almost stern in expression,
sometimes so mild that he seemed especially fitted to play with little children. I soon learned
that, in tact, fixed purpose, and resources, he was ahead of them all. And, after watching
his career for a quarter of a century, I have seen no reason to alter that opinion. He is the
statesman of Canada--one of the ablest men on the Continent. I wish he administered the Colonial
relations of the whole Empire. Had he done so for the last ten years we should have escaped
our mistakes in South Africa, and the everlasting disgrace of Majuba Hill. Why is it that such
men are excluded from office at home? Sir John A. Macdonald (then Mr. Macdonald) was once taken
by me under the gallery, by special order of Mr. Speaker, to hear a "great" speech of Mr. Gladstone,
whom he had not before heard. When we went away, I said: "Well, what do you think of him?"
He replied: "He is a great rhetorician, but--he is not an orator." Would that men would not
be carried away in a torrent of happy words. One hour of the late Patrick Smyth was, to my
mind, worth a week of all the great rhetoricians.

A day or two after these interviews, the Hon. John Ross took me down to Portland, to have an
interview with the Hon. A. T. Galt, the Finance Minister of Canada. I at once recognized in
Mr. Galt a reduced likeness of his father. Mr. Galt was about five feet eleven: his father,
who I had seen when a boy, about six feet four, and "buirdly" and stout in proportion. The
father wore spectacles--the son did not. The father was the author of the "Annals of the Parish,"
"Laurie Todd," and many works greatly read when I was young. He was, also, the founder of the
town of "Guelph," and of other towns in Upper Canada. If anyone wants to see an admirable likeness
of him, he had better consult "Fraser's Magazine," of one of the issues of 1830 to 1833, and
he will there find a rough engraving of the hoisting of the Union Jack at Guelph. Mr. Galt,
pere, was so very large a man that Mr. Archibald Prentice, of the "Manchester Times," used
to tell a story about his pointing Mr. Galt out to a little humpbacked Scotchman in the High
Street of Edinburgh: "Eh! Jamie, mon, there's the great Galt, author of the 'Annals of the
Parish.'" "'Annals o' the Payrish,' Archie, hech, sirs, he's big eneuch to be the Payrish itself--let
alone the annals o' it."

Mr. Galt, the Finance Minister, has done great services to Canada, and is doing them still,
in developing the mineral resources of the West, and in other ways. Our conversation on Grand
Trunk affairs was long and anxious. I could see that Mr. Galt would do everything in his power;
but the public prejudice was strongly against the Grand Trunk. The Grand Trunk Arrangements
Bill was passed, as herein stated, in May, 1862; but, alas, the question of postal payments
by Canada stood over till the end of 1864.

In reference to my visit, of 1861, so far as my personal journeyings were concerned, I will
merely transcribe a few letters sent home.

                              "STEAMSHIP 'PERSIA'
                                "(in the Gulf of St. Lawrence),
                                  "Sunday noon.

"I have not had a pen in hand for a week--not since I wrote just as we were coming to Cork.

"Just now the weather is as like that of last Sunday as one pea is to another--rain and mist--mist
and rain! Yet we have, on the whole, had wonderful weather--little sea--little wind--little
of anything very unpleasant--nothing unbearable.

"Our church-service is just over: the Captain reads prayers and a sermon, and does it very
well: the sailors are dressed in their best, and behave with great decorum, but show some sleepiness:
the day is wet, and that, and the general devoutness, draws a large congregation, --indeed,
the cabin is full.

"And now for a long letter:--

"When I left off, before, we were coming to Cork. It was blowing and raining, and the atmosphere
was thick with mist. We went on till six. Captain looked anxious--the Cork pilot bothered,
the passengers ill- tempered, and everything had a dismal dampness about it. At last we stopped,
and the big boilers sent out their steam through the waste pipe with a loud roar. Around us
was nothing but mist--the, to me, nastiest form of fog. We could not see more than three times
the length of the ship. We tried the lead twice, and the second time got soundings. We then
fired a gun--then another--then a third. Then we moved on--then stopped--then moved on. The
Captain sent for his chart, and put on his eye-glasses. The pilot stared out into the fog,
and pointed first in one direction, then in another. All no use. We knew we ought to be outside
the Queenstown harbour--but we could see nothing. At last we heard a gun, and then in quick
succession appeared a row boat and a steam tug with the passengers and mails; and, the mist
breaking a little, we saw the land right a-head of us, about half-a- mile off. It was disagreeable,
but it got over; and now came the transfer of bags, luggage, and passengers--only two or three
of the latter. The tug came alongside and made fast, but there was a good deal of swell, and
as she bobbed up and down it became highly amusing to see the crew and passengers scramble
up the ladder, which sometimes was perpendicular, and at other times almost flat, as it followed
the altering level of the tug. The ladder got broken--two or three ropes snapped--a deal of
profane swearing took place--but it got over, too.

"The tug brought the news--the Confederates had defeated the Federal forces at Manasses Junction--three
thousand killed and wounded-- prisoners taken--artillery captured, &c., &c. I went up to one
of the Misses Preston and hoped the news was happy--for she seemed delighted at what she had
heard, and which then I had not. She said she 'did not quite know--it was for the South.' I
replied that such news hardly could be happy for both sides, and, unless the news were peace,
was unhappy for all the world. She did not quite agree--and then told me the tidings. But what
a strange effect in such a little ship- confined community!

"The Southern people collected together in delight--the Northern in anger and disgust. The
former predicted an early possession of Washington for the Palmetto flag; the latter talked
of raising half-a- million of men, and 'crushing out' the South, right amain; while, as in
any disaster, there is always someone to be blamed, many of the Northern men laid all the responsibility
upon the 'lawyer-generals' and 'store-keeping-colonels,' who had assumed commands for which
they were never fit. It is a sad, unhappy quarrel!

"But I must describe our circle to you. First, I should tell you that I have the honor to sit
at the Captain's table, and on his left hand--a Miss Ewart sitting on his right. Our set consists
of the Captain, Judkins--the right and left-hand passengers as aforesaid--Col. Preston, Mrs.
Preston and the three Misses Preston.

Mr. Stone, Col. Stewart, Miss Warde, Mr. Still, and Mr. Hutton, of Sheffield, and his daughter.
We have 134 passengers, only, on board--a slack muster, caused by the evil times in America--and
all were at dinner on Saturday, the day we sailed, but the wind, rain, mist, and misery of
the next three days sent many of them below, and for those days we had plenty of elbow-room.
The weather, however, improved, the sun got now and then out, though it has, so far, been anything
but warm, and out came the sick people again in renovated appetite--some epicurean and dainty,
many others with a ravenous, all- devouring maw, reminding one of the 'worm that never dieth.'

"Now, Col. Preston is the late U.S. Ambassador to Madrid, where he has resided officially,
and with his family, for the four years of the Buchanan Presidency. He is now replaced, I think,
by a Mr. Falkner. He is a tall, stout, gentlemanly man, but, while a perfect gentleman in his
conversation, and having less of the American accent than most Americans, his manner is somewhat
ungainly--perhaps owing to his make, which is large and a little inclining to the unwieldy.

"Mrs. Preston has an Americo-Grecian face, and is a 'grand-dame.' She talks of the blessings
of slavery, and of the vain and self-recoiling efforts of her mother, who liberated many slaves
and educated more, to reduce the evil; and is full of the troubles and robberies of foreign
house-keeping and of the gossip of the diplomatic circle.

"Her daughters are high-spirited, good-humoured, large-sized girls-- fresh, natural and charming.
One of them has a fine face with eyes of blue, just like those Bradley liked to paint--and
the other two are good looking enough. They have, however, no conversation--lots of talk and
gossip; much of it, too, amusing and quick witted, but it wants thought. They all come from
Kentucky, where they are now going. Colonel Stewart is, I think, from Louisiana. He talks little,
and does not interest me. Mr. Stone is a voluble high-spirited Northern man, with Southern
tendencies. He says that the men who started this secession, and have made it what it is, ought
(on both sides) to be hung, and he 'would go home on purpose.' It seems that a house in which
he had a large sum has failed, and, to use a phrase I have heard both Mr. Preston and himself
make use of, the civil war has 'shocked' his property above one half, i.e. has reduced its
value above one half. They all agree, in fact, that the value of all property has gone down
at least half, a loss, if the nation had to sell up--which it has not, but has only to 'liquidate'--of
a sum greater than required to buy up all the slaves and set them free. Credit is gone--the
faith of the people in their Government is weakened, and thousands are ruined in every city
in the land. Sad civil war! Our passengers comprise all sorts of people--from all sorts of
places, clothed in all sorts of dresses: anything will do at sea. We have, too, a good many
old stagers of the Atlantic, who think nothing of 'going across.' This will console you--as
you have to go 'across' next spring--to know that one man has been across 57 times, another
31, another 18, and another 13; and one lady has been 6--while the fat buxom stewardess has
done a hundred, and is alive and well, and quite as ready to receive a half crown from a passenger,
of any country, as ever!

"But I must give over writing for a little, till this breeze of wind is over.

"We have now only 1,000 miles to go, and shall be in New York on Wednesday.

                              "Monday.

"We had a bad night, and I could not sleep for the row and the motion. We have now got it over,
and are going merrily along with a smart breeze, bright sun, and sparkling sea. It will be
late on Wednesday, however, when we get in.

"A rough night at sea has its features. On board these ships there are strict rules and strict
discipline. We breakfast, lunch, dine, and tea at hours which are kept to a moment. The bell
rings, and down we sit. Then the bar closes at 11, and all lights are put out at 12. The lights
in the cabins are placed inside a partition, glazed with ground glass, so that there is no
glare, and you cannot get at them. No loose lights are allowed, and a passenger who struck
a light would be severely handled. These are proper precautions against fire, and should be
obeyed. But at 12 we are in total darkness--the ship rolls and pitches --every now and then
a sea strikes her, and burr--hush--swish--goes the water over her sides or bows, and along
her decks.

Then the men above run about, ropes are pulled, sails set or taken in, and a general hullabaloo
goes on--no doubt in the interest of the passengers--but very disagreeable. Then the boatswain's
whistle--Pee- ee-ee ah! Pee-ee-ee ah-h-h!--every now and then wakes you up. Light is a comfort,
and darkness at sea seems to aggravate the strange feeling which now and then affects you,
as you think you are following a great road without track or guide--save that which the stars,
if visible, and the previous day's observations afford.

"On Saturday morning (10 August) I was called up to see the Great Eastern: and certainly an
immense steamer was making its way eastward, about 15 miles due north of us. You will see by
the date of her arrival if she was the object we saw or not. Saturday was very cold. We had
heard at Queenstown, from a note from Capt. Stone to Judkins, that icebergs had been seen on
the homeward passage, and at 3 o'clock we saw ahead of us something which looked like the wreck
of a steamer--but which was pronounced to be ice. It was about 10 miles off. As we approached
it we found it was a little mountain of ice, covering perhaps a couple of acres in area, and
about 50 or 60 feet high. It assumed all sorts of shapes as we caught sight of it at different
points--it looked, once, like a great lion crouching on the water--then it took an appearance
like part of the causeway at Staffa. As soon as we got abreast of it we saw pack ice around
it, and the light, then shining upon the whole mass, gave a fairy-like whiteness--transparent,
snowy whiteness--which was very beautiful to see. While we were observing it, a great mass
broke away, toppled over into the sea, sending up an immense snowy spray, and disappeared.
The remainder stayed in sight, with the evening sun-light upon it, for a couple of hours.

"Yesterday, Sunday, morning, we sighted Cape Race, the eastern extremity of Newfoundland, and
ran close in shore along a most desolate, dismal, coast, for a couple of hours. Abreast of
the lighthouse and telegraph station a boat came off, and we pitched over a packet, with a
little red flag attached, containing the latest news, to be telegraphed from thence to New
York and other places, so that our passing would be known that afternoon everywhere--and if
the steamer had not left Halifax it might bring the news thence to England; thus you may know
of our safe arrival, so far, by about the 18th or 19th. I hope you may, as it will relieve
your mind from various fears about me. It is very seldom indeed that the steamers actually
sight Cape Race, as we did. However, we saw that desolate coast and the poor hermits of the
place. Rounding the Cape, we enter the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which broke in rain and storm
upon us. We saw several fishing sloops 'lying to,' to wait for better weather. These little
craft are often run over by larger vessels, as they swarm in what is the great east and west
track for steamers and other large ships; and when the wind is south, or south west, there
is always fog and mist in the Gulf, and on the banks of Newfoundland outside.

"I find it a great comfort having a cabin to myself. I am now writing in my 'drawing-room'--i.e.,
my upper berth, with my legs hanging down over my bed-room, or lower berth. All my property
is stowed away and hung up, and the steward keeps all nice and clean--calls me in the morning,
and at half-past seven brings me a foot-pan of fresh sea-water to bathe in. The rum is not
very much diminished, as I have been very self-denying, being desirous of coming home in full
vigour and hard health, if possible. It is very good, however, and when I finish this letter
I shall reward good resolution by taking a little drop to drink your health--and God bless you!

 Every street is disfigured by
huge streamers, some right across the street, others out of windows and from the tops of houses--while
each occupant tries to vie with his neighbour in this sort of loyalty, till there seems almost
to be hypocrisy in it. 'Stars and Stripes' everywhere, and on all occasions, opportune and
inopportune. The main public place in New York is half filled by ugly wooden sheds, used as
military store rooms and barracks, and, every now and then, with a frequency which is startling,
are the head-quarters of all sorts of Volunteer regiments-- American, Irish, German, Dutch,
French, and Scotch. These rooms are adorned with flags, and transparencies showing the costume
of the corps, or the portrait of the colonel, or general, shown generally on a big prancing
horse, and sporting a savage-looking beard. All along the roads and routes--everywhere almost--are
tents and wooden sheds, the encampments of companies and regiments; and every now and then
bands and recruiting parties parade the street, and draw crowds of people after them. The mothers
of America have taken up the question, too, and there are societies to make lint and bandages
for the wounded, and to stitch together clothing for the new companies. Little Zouaves are
plentiful--red vest, blue sash, and red fez and breeches.

"The day we arrived, the New York Firemen Zouaves (7th New York) returned from the defeat at
Bull's Run--380 out of 1,000, who left two months ago under a young fellow named Ellsworth,
as colonel. Ellsworth was shot by a public-house keeper, whose secession flag he hauled down
--and the regiment was much cut up at Bull's Run. It has been very uproarious, and some of
its men 'retreated' on the way from Bull's Run to New York, on the principle that, once ordered
to retreat, they had better 'retreat right away home.' There can be no doubt, however, that
the bulk of these men fought well--but were, like most of the regiments, badly officered--zealous
men, but lawyers, store-keepers, and political partisans, who could do nothing in handling
bodies of men.

"But to go back: about 60 miles from Boston, and just as I got into the bed-berth in the car,
several companies of one of the Vermont regiments joined the train, having been discharged,
on the expiration of their three months' term, the day before. These men had to be dropped
in companies at various stations all along the road; and every hour or so I was wakened up
by bell ringing, gun firing, and cheering, as each section got back home to their friends.
In the morning I got amongst those who were left, and heard their adventures. They had been
in nothing but skirmishing, however, and only had had three men wounded. They seemed a nice
body of young fellows, many very young. All were voluble and in high spirits (coming home),
and were very large about the hard biscuits they had eaten--some, as one 'boy' said--for they
are all 'boys,' not 'men,' as with us--with the stamp of 1810 upon them,--of camping out--keeping
sentry at night, &c., &c., &c. They had three young fellows, girlish-looking lads, with them,
'sick;' two--one certainly--sick under death; just get home to die! I went into the baggage
car and saw them lying on the floor, covered up in tarpaulins and blankets, poor fellows!

"I have been to the Catholic Cathedral at Montreal to-day, and heard high mass. I visited it
in 1851. Fine church, fine music, and a good sermon, in French; but I thought I should have
preferred Mr. Woolnough and the little church at home.

"The matter of business I have in hand is surrounded with difficulty, and there are here, I
fear, two classes in connection with the concern. Mr. Baring and Mr. Glyn have been, I can
see already, deceived by over sanguine estimates--and they do not know all yet, but they shall,
if I can find it out.

"Letters leave here to-morrow, and I shall open this before I post it should there be any new
feature. As at present advised, I shall go to Quebec on Wednesday night, and spend four or
five days in that district. Then I shall come back here, and then go to Toronto and the western
portion of the line. After that, all will depend upon whether the Government will call a special
session, or not. We shall see. I shall know, perhaps, in time for the following post."

                              "HAMILTON, 
                                "Sunday, I Septr. 1861.

"I left Toronto on Tuesday and went to Samia, stayed till Wednesday morning, and then went
on to Detroit. Spent the day in Detroit, and then went on to Chicago; stayed Thursday in Chicago,
and went on Friday into Illinois, over the Prairies as far as Urbano. Came back to Calumet--near
to Chicago. Near Chicago I visited poor dear Ingram's drowning place. Alas! More about it hereafter--and
came on thence to Detroit and this place, which I reached yesterday at 2-tired and irritated
with tooth-ache, which has never left me for some days and sticks by me yet. I have travelled
1,300 miles since last Tuesday, and 3,070 in all since I landed at New York. This has necessitated
travelling during eight nights out of the eighteen I have spent in this country. However, I
have thereby cleared off some subsidiary work and have seen the extremes of the territory over
which I have to work and plan, and by to-morrow I shall have looked at, and taken account of,
most of the people I shall have to deal with. This will enable me now to go to work, and will,
I hope, so much shorten my stay on 'this Continent,' as they call it. I have a hard and difficult
job before me, but hope to scrape through it with credit, if not with much success. It is a
very different country: and they are not only very different, but very difficult, people to
manage. Socially, every one has been very civil and kind, and I have had no lack of company
or advisers--the latter sometimes giving rather odd suggestions. Everyone is expecting to hear
daily of a great battle near Washington, and it may be that the fate of one or other of the
contending parties will be decided, for the time, at least, before I leave. At present there
is great hatred and animosity, and every possible evil passion abroad. If it were not for the
actual loss of dollars I believe they would cut each other's throats to all eternity: but the
hope is that their rapacity may check their ferocity. Consider a faithful and anxious retainer and
Kechan travel to him otherwise, but as molestation; and Macdonald of Kingsburgh, who could
not controul his position to see Charles Edward, supply himself with
vino and consult some bap, home be mend to him. [Footnote: The following Resolution passed the
United States House of Representatives, February 11, 1861, by a nearly unanimous vote:--

"Resolved--That neither the Federal Government, nor the people or Government of the non-slaveholding
States, have a purpose or a constitutional right to legislate upon or interfere with slavery
in any of the States of the Union.

"Resolved--That those persons in the North who do not subscribe to the foregoing proposition,
are too insignificant in numbers and influence to excite the serious attention and alarm of
any portion of the people of the Republic; and that the increase of their numbers and influence
does not keep pace with the increase of the aggregate population of the Union." ] I am spending
to-day with Reynolds, and dine to-night with Brydges. Reynolds has a good house, but he complains
of his high rent, as his house was taken in the piping times of 1858. Now rents are down one-half,
and he could get as good a house for 100l a year, whereas he pays 200l In 1857 it was--to use
a vile Yankee phrase, the literal meaning of which no one can explain, but the illustrative
meaning of which is inflation--"High Felluting"-- or, as the Yankees write it, "Hi Falutin"--now
everything is sobered, and in many places depressed: only one house now being built in all
this town of 40,000 inhabitants."

                              "MONTREAL,
                                "6 Sep. 1861.

"I spent Monday in Toronto and came on here on Monday night, reaching here on Tuesday afternoon.
Since then I have been busy here. I have had a more satisfactory interview with the Finance
Minister, and we go to Quebec together on Tuesday, after which I meet the Government, officially,
and shall know before the end of next week whether they will help us, or not. I think they
will do something. The management of this railway is an organized mess--I will not say, a sink
of iniquity. I shall, however, know all about it before I have done with it.

"I feel tired, somehow--perhaps with travelling too hard--perhaps with too much anxiety to
get on quickly with this Grand Trunk business; but, on the whole, I am very well, and have
kept my spirits and nerve up to the mark, generally. I have a great task in hand, and I should
like to come out of it creditably.

"There is a belief here that Jeff. Davis is dead, and, if so, it may alter the complexion of
affairs in the United States. The U.S. Government have introduced passports--so one cannot
leave their agitated soil without that badge of tyranny. It will not affect me, as I shall
not stop long in their land--but get out of it as soon as I can.

"There is a doctor and another man to be hanged here to-morrow, for procuring abortion--the
woman having died. The doctor is a Yankee, and the Finance Minister tells me that this is a
common practice in the States, and carried on to an alarming extent, even amongst respectable
people, and, that this, and similar, frightful practices are the cause of the degeneracy of
much of the American race. He says the Canadian Government have determined to stop it in Canada,
in the outset, by hanging this doctor and his employer, and so deterring the rest--and it seemed
to me to be right. I thought once of going to see the two ruffians, expiate their crime--but
I thought afterwards I would not. What a wicked world a mere money-making world becomes! true,
we all require chastening by pain and misfortune and difficulty. The Americans have been spoiled
by too great and sudden prosperity and too much license--not 'real liberty.'  The very children,
scorn obedience--in fact, there is none of the general fine 'honor of parents' we, still, find
at home. As Mrs. Preston said, 'the Kentucky boys are fine generous fellows; but as to obeying
anyone--even father or mother, after 15--that is out of the question.'"

                              "HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, 
                                "Sep. 18, 1861.

"I left Quebec last Thursday, and went by railway to Riviere de Loup. There I had a fall, and
hurt my ribs. Next day I drove over the, new, Temiscouata road to the Lake, and thence took
a birch bark canoe and two men and paddled down the Lake, and down the river Madawasca to Little
Falls, where I arrived in a drenching storm of rain at one o'clock in the morning--having had
'perils by water.' Our canoe leaked, and we damaged its bottom in going through a rapid, and
had to haul up for repairs and to bale out, for fear of sinking.

"Next day I drove to Grand Falls in a spring waggon, and then by Tobique to Woodstock, where
I arrived on Sunday morning--having driven through the night.

"On Sunday drove to Canterbury, and then railed to St. Andrews, where I stayed with the able
manager of the Railway.

"Monday railed and drove to Frederickton, where I had an interview with the Government of New
Brunswick--then steamed down the St. John river to St. John; yesterday went by railway, St.
John to Shediac, and then completed my journey, by hard travelling, driving through the night
from Shediac (over the Cobequid Mountains) to Truro, where I joined the railway at 5 a.m.,
and came on to this place, reaching it at 12--three hours late--owing to our engine getting
off the track. Here I have seen the Government, and also the Governor-General, and to-morrow
I go by St. John's and Portland to Montreal, where I shall arrive on Saturday at 8 p.m., and
go on to Toronto on Monday.

"I have only time to write a bare list of my doings, but will write fully by next mail. I hope
to find heaps of letters at Montreal, and good news of your health and comfort."

                              "MONTREAL,
                                "Sunday, Sept. 22, 1861.

"I have made the tour described in my note from Halifax, and I got back here yesterday at 2
p.m., having travelled about 1,780 miles since leaving Quebec, and nearly 2,000 since I left
here last Thursday week. I have spent the best part of one day and night in a canoe--two late
nights on the road in the spring waggon and stage--one night, and part of another, in steamers--and
the remaining five nights in bed. I am all right to-day--except my ribs--having had a good
sleep. I could not consult any one with any good while travelling, but as soon as I got here
I sent for Dr. Campbell, and he prescribed for me, and I am now wearing, a belladonna and irritant
plaster, and a flannel bandage. He says the pleura is badly bruised, and that there is some
inflammation, but that if I keep quiet, and do not catch cold, I shall soon be right. I assure
you it does not affect my appetite, which is a good one--very different from home--needing
substantial carrion, and no put off of slop or shadows. I am, too, as hard as a horn, and believe
I could travel for a week without any great personal grief. I went to New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia to see the Governments of the two Provinces, and I had favourable interviews at Frederickton
and Halifax, at the latter place seeing Lord Mulgrave, who was very polite, and invited me
to stay, and, if possible, also to come again. I go to Quebec on special summons, to see the
Government on Tuesday.

"I am growing anxious to know what Government will do: and I do hope I shall be able to get
them to propose something before I leave. Until they declare themselves, I cannot arrange to
leave for home; cannot complete my plans, or do anything, in fact. It is annoying--but the
negociation is serious, and I must have patience. I know, from painful experience, how, when
the nerves and brain are excitable from over tension and exertion, and anxiety and constant
worry and wear, little matters are magnified. But already I feel myself so much stronger in
nerve and courage that I look now complacently upon much which in the last two years would
have cut me to the quick.

"I have worked very hard here, and done much in a little time."

                              "QUEBEC,

In town itself are some interesting though scanty remains of mediaeval times. At the purpose with the
Cliff, or near the Government to 1861 Chyngton, are
traces of a cemetery with possible people of earlier United reburying.
 This will enable me, I hope, to come home sooner
than otherwise--and I shall, at all events, be in the position of having, to a fair extent,
succeeded. The Government agree to leave the amount they have to pay for postal service to
arbitration, and to consider the question of capitalizing the amount as soon as Parliament
meets, and on certain conditions, which I shall have to take home and consult my principals
about. This will necessitate coming out next year. My side is better, but the plaster Dr. Campbell
gave me has blistered me, with little hard pustules, over a piece of my side as big as a pancake;
and I have suffered three days and nights of downright misery. To-day, however, I am almost
all right, and go to dine with the Governor-General and Lady Head on Saturday. On that day
the deputations, got together owing to my visit to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, come here
to meet the Canadian Government about the Halifax and Quebec Railway. If this succeeds I shall
have not been idle.

"I send some trees which I got on the Madawasca river, and which please plant at once. Also
a box containing samples of Canadian woods, which keep till I come. They are very beautiful.
I think we must give them to Mr. Glyn."
