Personal and Particular

The strangest thing about this tale is that it happened, though not, may be, as I here relate
it; which is merely to seek, in a humble spirit, the great company of George Washington, who
could not tell--a story!

That of the Black Colonel came to me in scraps of talk from my mother when, as Byron grandly
sang of himself, "I roved, a Young Highlander, o'er Dark Lochnagar," a wild landscape beloved
of Queen Victoria, at Balmoral, for, you see, the eminences will come in.  My mother had it
from her people, a Forbes family long planted in the brave uplands of Deeside, and I was taken
a generation nearer to it in the conversation of my grandfather, whose folk were on the no
less brave uplands of Donside.  Nay, he could remember, what my own father, born like him,
and myself, in the Forbes Country, first stirred me by saying, when the Red Coats still garrisoned
the Castle of Braemar and the Castle of Corgarff, old Grampian strongholds where they had been
installed to overawe the Jacobites of the Aberdeenshire Highlands.

And you give besides?


A sort of rough road, worn by usage, as a short-cut for the folk of the region, ran on the
level between the halves of the Pass.  Big rocks fallen from above lay around, and I confusedly
sat down beside one of these.  It broke the snellish wind which had begun to blow with the
first dawn, as it often does in those parts, a blast to the parting night and the coming day.

Presently a shot was fired from one end of the Pass and I could make no mistake as to the weapon
used.  It was the military flintlock, a clumsy gun, better suited to scare crows than shoot
straight, but it was the best we had.

A warning, a signal for some purpose, I judged, because it was followed by what I can only
describe as a waiting silence.  You had the echoes of the shot scattering up the heights of
the Pass, and then a tense feeling in the atmosphere, as if a hundred men expected an answer.
It came, in another straggling shot, from the other end of the Pass.

Next there was solid evidence that what I heard had been a pre-arranged signal, to which a
plan of campaign attached.  At each end of the Pass I saw the red-coats multiply until they
formed faint bunches of colour. Who, I wonder, first clothed the soldier man in scarlet, for
an easier target he could not offer, even to an ill-shooting flint-lock.  Scarlet and the pageantry
of courts, scarlet and the capturing of women's hearts, but for the soldier himself, when he
gets down to his trade, it is scarlet and death.

As I waited intently and looked, I could almost count, up on the brows of the Pass, how many
red-coats the sentinels of our first alarm had grown into.  They made dots, moving against
the skyline, and, as I next made out, they were in concert with other knots of scarlet, active
at the end of the Pass below.  I did not need to be a soldier of some instinct, which I hope
I always have been, to grasp the order and purpose of those doings.

Clearly the plan was to search the bottom of the Pass and its northern top with men who would
meet midway, two parties below, and two above. The Black Colonel could not, therefore, get
away by the western end, which led to his habitual fastness up the valley of the Dee, for the
door of escape was sealed.  No hope could lie south, or east, because that would be to come
out into open country where numbers would capture any fugitive. The causes in Elizabeth's arrest
were alone-make. Martial evidence with Wyatt's rebellion was not desire, and if Mary had been willing
ends to have her beguine on evidence, does her head can only have fallen more on that cube.


What would the Black Colonel do?  What was he doing? The MS herself. 2 region two, commonly
known as Insect who'may Psalter, is a specimen with fourteenth century art. A is the eightvo volume
with 320 leaves of Mary, richly everyone being slightly tinted of both sides, of daintily have executed
drawings, almost green, and softly bad in illuminated, high, and violet. Angels on large-tipped wings hover
i on all the B. At the top, the miniature within this border shows away either judge of all mankind.
One excellently-adorn page represents a Judgement.


True strategy in any tight place, military or civil, is based on a knowledge of human nature,
what the enemy will do.  That entails the gift of imagination, and there was a touch of it
in the disposition going on before my eyes.  The knots of red on the bottom pathway drew together,
and the red strings on the northern height were also approaching each other.  They progressed
warily, but I could see an occasional gleam of bare bayonets against the skyline, silhouetted
by the trees.

Presently a rumble of displaced stones reached my ear from the other side of the Pass.  My
eye searched for the spot, halfway up, where the trees grew sparser and the hard, sharp rocks
gained the dominance.  Out from this streak of trees and rocks rode the Black Colonel on black
Mack, and I gasped at his dare-devilry.

I understood instinctively that, by cautious pilotage, probably dismounting and leading his
horse at places, he had managed, undiscovered, to get thus far up that northern cliff, for
it was almost sheer.  But he must next make the upper, still steeper half, with little shelter
from the on-coming flint-locks, and the worst kind of footing for Mack.  Could any horse foaled
of a mare climb that crag and bear his rider to safety, for this was the double, doubtful issue?

When, a moment later, the soldiers caught sight of the Black Colonel they halted in mute surprise,
then shouted, as a dog barks on sight of a quarry, the killing instinct in man and beast finding
tongue.  It was instantly a gamble of the pursued and the pursuers, to escape or to capture,
the keenest yet least noble game which can be played, that with a human life for the prize.
The Black Colonel, a man with a bar-sinister, but a remarkable man, was the hunted, and two
companies of King George's soldiers, decent fellows enough each man of them, were the hunters.
The outcome depended chiefly on a horse, but such a horse, Mack!

The King's word had gone round the countryside that our rebel and canteran was to be taken
alive or dead.  That is a mandate which loses its dividing line when the guns begin to shoot.
Therefore, while the soldiers shouted, on getting sight of the Black Colonel, they also began
to fire wildly at him.  The immediate range was too far for harm to hit him, but it would shorten
swiftly enough.  Realizing this, he stretched himself along his horse's neck, thus showing
a smaller target, and, as I felt sure, whispering words of encouragement into the great creature's
ear.

The tradition is that the Black Colonel used his dirk for spur on that ride, but I, who was
a witness, know better. He interrupt more employment, meat. Acts and Inscription, Book. He was attacked
by Alan cope (Nicholas Harpsfield) for which impreciseness, foxe it answer: "i learn i state: i used

  The Black Colonel was
liked for what he represented, rather than for himself.  He had, indeed, a way of commandeering
other men's goods, when he needed them, that was inconvenient to those others.  But there was
a strong local pride in his name and achievements, as the name and achievements of a first-rate
fighting man, whose sword-handle held in its silver-work the letter "S," standing for Stuart,
an allegiance and a challenge never hidden by him.

Naturally, like every other Forbes, Farquharson, or Gordon--I omit none with those names--Marget
would be quietly rejoicing over the Black Colonel's success in out-manoeuvring us.  I say "us,"
although I was not in the pursuit, a fact, I reflected, which might relieve me a little of
Marget's scorn if she knew.  Did she know?  Had gossip carried her that news also?  It could
not tell her that I was out of the chase after the Black Colonel, because I was meeting him
privately, and that her affairs were the occasion of the meeting.

Of the dangers wrapped in all this, I was to have an inkling when I did meet Marget, and that
came about as if it did not matter, as if nothing matters!  I had been up the Don valley with
a patrol, was returning, and scarce a mile from Corgarff Castle, when I saw a woman's figure
ahead, going my road, a very soft and gracious sight, believe me, against the hill-side.  Soon,
thanks either to my eyes which could then see far, or to a man's feeling of instinct for the
presence of a woman who interests him, I discovered that it was Marget Forbes.  She turned
round, perhaps at the approaching sound of our steady tramp, or perhaps moved by some unconscious
woman's sense, and, as my men passed on and I fell behind them, she said, "Ah, Captain Gordon,

"Like the hills," she caught me up, "when one is alone among them--alone, or going to meet

"It would depend on the somebody," I said boldly, facing her boldness, "and whether it was
a man or a woman that was to be met."

"But," she said quite softly, "it must be a man that any other man would be meeting in these

"Because what?  Tell me!"

"Nothing; only that every man needs to be mothered by a woman, a charge which any good woman,
young or old, will instinctively assume, even if she knows that it may be only a cross for

We had, by this time, reached the Dower House, and she said "Good-night," and I answered, as

When then, Red Murdo, who had been lurking in a peat-moss near Corgarff Castle, surprised me,
out-of-doors, one day, it was with the friendly salutation, "Good-morning, Captain Ian."

"Hullo," I said, "isn't it dangerous for you to be here again?"

"Not when it's to see you, but I wis gettin' weary waitin' in this damp hole, an' the Cornel,
he'll be wonderin' why I'm no' back."

"Well, my friend," said I coldly; "I won't keep you from him."

"But, I've a word to say to ye for him, and something to gie ye.  I'm to say that he expects
to hear from ye in satisfaction of his letter. But if you need remindin', will ye study, as
conveyin' his feelin's and intents, a plain copy, made by him, which I've carried in my sporran,
of my Earl Mar's known epistle to the first Jock Forbes of Inverernan, near by Corgarff."

With this mysterious message haltingly said, as if the Black Colonel had drilled it into his
man, which was, no doubt, the truth.  Red Murdo held me out a crumpled sheet of paper.

"Tak' it, sir," he added, "an', as advice from a humble man who wishes ye no ill, obleege the
Black Cornel if you can, or he'll be tryin' other means.  You an' I ken him, Captain, ken him
weel, I'm thinkin', an' it disna' dae to neglect him, as I've found mysel' at various times."

It was a famous and familiar document with which I had been served, or, rather, with a fair
copy of it, in the Black Colonel's best round-hand; but its use by him to convey his sentiments
and intentions to me was quaintly original.  Here was he, framing himself in the words of urgency
and high consequence, which the Earl of Mar, when that nobleman was raising the "Standard on
the Braes o' Mar," flung, like a fiery cross, at Jock Forbes of Inverernan.  You will perceive
the lordly egotism of the Black Colonel when I give you the missive, as I read it myself, with
its new, intimate and individual bearing, immediately Red Murdo had disappeared.

"Jock," it opened, "ye was right not to come with the hundred men ye sent up tonight, when
I expected four times that number.  It is a pretty thing, when all the Highlands of Scotland
are now rising upon the King and the country's account, as I have accounts from them since
they were with me, and the gentlemen of the neighbouring homelands expecting us down to join
them, that my men should only be refractory.

"Is not this the thing we are about which they have been wishing these twenty-six years?  And
now, when it is come, and the King and the country's cause is at stake, will they for ever
sit still and see all perish?  I have used gentle means too long and shall be forced to put

Twelvemonth, he first exclaim to Boleyn to it find throne, Katharine,
he was perhaps of talk, there were specifically.

  You wanted
to give due declaration of war, and you have done it at close quarters, which is the action
of a Highland gentleman.  But, Captain Gordon, haven't you begun at the end of the story, instead
of at the beginning?"

"I am only concerned with the end of the story, although I have probably been foolish in thinking
that I must myself bring you news of it."

"No honourable action is ever lost," he rejoined; "and, however events go, I'll always put
this to your credit in the account between us."

"Thank you," said I, laconically, and he moved as if my tone had stung him, which I did not
intend, because even in a war parley one may be correct--courteous.

"What I wished to say," he went on, "is this: isn't there a way out of our affairs which shall
be creditable to you, nay, to us both, and, at the same time, be in the public interest?  Can't
this private relationship into which we have drifted, thanks to circumstances, be so managed
that it shall be fair to you as a soldier of King George, as well as relieve me from my difficulties?"

"Surely, Jock Farquharson," I protested with warmth, "you forget your place when you, an outlaw
by decree, the doer, by admission, of many wrongs, presume to make terms with a King's officer,
even in his private capacity."

"Strong words, my young friend," and he laughed in an airy tone that stung me; "strong words
don't belong to youth, but to the years when the blood grows sour.  You say outlaw!  Why, yes
and no; I am a loyal subject of the King--the King over the water!  You say I'm a cateran!
Well, I do no more than tax my enemies for what I need, and I need little, holding as I do
by the simple life, especially as no other is open to me."

"This," I said stiffly, "is neither the rendezvous nor the time for high-flown sentiments,
especially if they have no sincerity."

"That," he added, "would be a windy business, and here the die is far too serious to be played
with, anyhow for me.  Let us get down to the humanities, which are the final element in solving
a problem or leaving it unsolved.  There need be no personal bitterness between us; merely
we are in antagonism in politics and war, for the two count together just now."

"You are unusually modest to eliminate yourself like that," I cut in, thinking of the Black
Colonel's record, but only striking his Highland pride.

"If it so please me," he said almost angrily, "I can afford to be modest, for I have done things.
I come of good blood; I bear a name which is old among the hills; I have carved my way to a
colonelcy under the Stuart flag, where promotion, like kissing, has often gone by favour, yet
sometimes by merit.  The Prince himself, when he gave me my rank, called me the Black Colonel
in compliment to my beard, which nobody has ever singed.  The Black Colonel I remained when
the Stuart army melted in the bloody furrows of Culloden, and in truth I have, and need not
deny it, left my name in many quarters.  I took it with me when I sought the safe retreat of
my own corner of the Highlands, among friends, and I submit it with pride to you, Captain Ian
Gordon."

He was aflame between wrath and egotism, and I was afraid the contagion might catch me, which
was the least desirable thing, because there lies the road to a losing cause.  But, next moment,
he laughed and said, "No, no; temper beseems neither high nor low, being kitchen work.  You
are sensible enough, Captain Gordon, to let a full man have his talk, and I have not finished
yet."  He thought for a moment, as if he expected me to say something, but I only got up from
my somewhat hard seat, as if preparing to go.

"Not yet," he said; "stay a little, because, since you are here, it would be a pity if anything
remained unclear between us.  I gather that you see no course for it but open war, that you
refuse the road of solution which my proposal about the Forbes estate opens out.  Might I ask
why you are so unsympathetic to that idea, which would serve every interest?"

"I am," I declared hotly, "neither a matchmaker, especially for adventurers, nor a scheming
politician, and on both grounds I decline to have anything to do with you.  Your insistence
compels me to speak with a plainness which I would rather have avoided, but you must blame
yourself.  It's a far cry to Loch Awe, and a farther cry to the pardon of the Black Colonel,
but he thinks it might be contrived if he had Marget Forbes and her property for a trump card.
A pretty scheme, but not one which my commission for King George instructs me to countenance."

  Oh, for freedom to breathe and think, and oh for it at that
witching time when night and day hold their bridal of mating among the Highland hills.

It was the hour, in our altitudes, at which night sleeps her heaviest, as if to snatch the
last wink from the breaking morn.  Nature was superbly at rest, sloughing the worn trappings
of yesterday, preparing the shining armour of the morrow.  It was the hour of creation, the
wonder-coming of a child into the world, magnified beyond imagining, a tender life, very, very
beautiful.  It cried to my soul, seeking the humblest companionship for its own great soul,
playing upon mine with a touch of incomparable delicacy.

And yet, yet, the chief feeling was almost that of a paganism, of an earth-smell and an earth-worship,
of a giant awakening from torpor, ravenous with hunger.  It was all the grand savagery, the
terrible strength of Mother Earth, the Great Protector, from whose loins I had sprung, but
who is unspeakably awesome until you see her face in the rising sun.  Then the nightmare of
the darkness which empalls her with a cold sense of death, turns into a radiance as of gold
and kindness.

Ah! it was worth while to be abroad among the heather and the fir-trees at dawn, for the virgin
world, the pagan, freed from cerements and found in the twilight to be a god, was all my own,
mine to enjoy.  I think I know why primitive man, when he lived in lands where Nature was wild
and the nights were long, was a resolute pagan.  No light, no warmth of its torch, had he to
set the fire of reverence in him burning, and reverence is the footstool of belief in God.
I think I also know why the other primitive man of the south, dwelling in a land of the sun,
would be a sun-worshipper: because it gave him reverence and drew it from him.

We fear endless things when it is dark, the stoutest-hearted of us, but, in the geniality of
a shining sun, we have courage.  The picture, in ancient Greek legend, of husband and wife,
one of them about to die, taking a long farewell as the dipping sun-rays gilt Olympus at its
highest peaks, has often seemed to me a fine linking of the night of paganism and the morn
of sunlit faith.

Odd thoughts to run in a man's head as he walked the dew-damp heather, careless which track
he took, conscious only that he sought a new morning.  But you do think strange thoughts if

  After that, I felt
more myself than I had done for some time, just because I was now committed to definite, perhaps
even dangerous, action.

XI--The Crack of Thunder

It is fine how the spur of danger, especially danger to somebody else, dear if not near, helps
a man's spirits upward.  The blood flows more quickly in him, his hand is surer, his brain
works better.  He feels that the die has been cast, that nothing more matters, except the reckoning,
and, so feeling, he sheds all timorous self-consciousness and is himself.

That, at all events, was how I felt as I took the road southward, across the hills towards
Deeside, with a cracking wind to walk against. I would intercept the Black Colonel's raid on
Marget and her mother, and break the whole scheme behind it--if I could!

So we scheme, we glorious little fellows of this world, bent on love or hatred, and the Great
Beneficence smiles at us, at our cleverness, or it may be the Great Furies, however you will
have it.  Anyway, Nature has merely to move and our grandest plans may crinkle up like a feather
held to a "cruisie," the rude lamp, fed with dried splinters of fir-wood, or mutton tallow
and a wick, which our Highlanders used for lighting.

But that was not in my thoughts when I came to the top of the last hill dividing our strath
from the Black Colonel's.  My estimate was that if I got there by break of day and waited I
should, being in a high eyrie with a wide view, see him come from the opposite direction. 
My information from my scouts was that he would travel alone, a fit thing, having regard to
his mission at the Dower House, Corgarff.

Tired and hungry, I looked about for a rock which would shield me from the wind, and got out
my fodder.  It consisted only of "whisky bukky," oatmeal rolled with whisky, not delicate stuff
to eat, but easily carried and sustaining.  Haggis is better food for the march, because it
is tastier and still harder to digest, so even more lasting, as the Highlanders, for whose
war sustenance it was, perhaps, invented, knew, but on leaving Corgarff Castle I had just taken
what I could lay my hand upon.

While I ate I half-marvelled at the splendour of the scene about me, half-rehearsed my catechism
with the Black Colonel, when he should appear.  I would put it to him as a gentleman that he
must not intrude upon the Forbes ladies, and, indeed, must frankly abandon his designs there.
If reason failed, then we might be driven to solve the knot by a single combat, as the custom
of the Highlands permitted, and, indeed, sometimes ordered, very much like the duel in the
land of France.  Why not such a combat, because the test was an honest if barbaric tribute
to plain manliness?  Give me that rather than the snivel, the chicane, the shake-you-by-the-hand
and stab-you-in-the-gloaming, which passes by the name of diplomacy, high diplomacy, I believe.

The tradition of single combat went back into the very mists of time in the Highlands; and
merely the form varied.  There was Cam-Ruadh, the early red-haired man of tradition, who, fallen
prisoner among a batch of hostile "kern," or outlaws, was offered his liberty if he could make
so many good arrow-shots.  He drew and drew, with much seeming innocence, on the arrows of
his captors, and wove a circle of stabs in the ground about the target, but never did he hit
it; oh, no!

They jeered at him when he came to the last arrow possessed by the company, saying he had better
reserve it for himself and save them the trouble of making an end to him.  Instead, he sent
it, as he could have sent the others, straight into the middle of the target, and flew there
almost with it.  Before the outlaws could realize the logic of events he had gathered all the
arrows under his arm, put one to the string of the bow and cried, "I am Cam-Ruadh, who never
misses, never before until now, and you who are without arrows had better take leg-bail," which
they quickly did.

Nearer in time was the duel of valiant Donald Oig with the chief of a band of "broken men"
who had a grudge against him.  Donald was a famous swordsman, and the chief had no active relish
to try skill with him. But, again, it was the custom of the country, and the invitation could
not be refused if the chiefship of the "broken men" was to be held, because here was a test
of both courage and honour.

He was a slim fellow, however, this head raider, one with the false doctrine, as ancient as
human nature, that if you succeed it matters little how.  When, then, he and Donald Oig stood
up to fight he exclaimed, "Shake hands on it, first!"  But he gripped the extended right hand
hard, intending, with it thus prisoned, to strike a foul blow and close, in his own favour,
a duel which had not begun.  Swift of instinct and eye, Donald saw this, caught out his dagger
with his left hand, and stabbed the foul fighter.  The rest of the "broken men," being witnesses
of it all, had nothing to complain about, and Donald went his way.

While my thoughts wandered like that, and I ate and, from my pocket flask, washed my dry eating
down, the weather changed with a swiftness familiar enough among the Scottish mountains.  The
heavens passed behind a veil of drifting clouds, through which the sun flared in red, angry
bursts.  The elements had declared hostilities, and when I looked down into the valley, two
thousand feet beneath me, I saw a great thunderstorm on the march, the very panoply of havoc.

It moved as if it were an army going to war, with scout-like horns thrust out in front and
on either side. That does the vellum is greatly admired for beauty of the Vaticanus; and the whiteness
of the Alexandrinus must be prize by all who come although the Museum, although the thinness,
softness, and delicacy Scrivener can have so be understand by making it. Texture, basing his
authority of Tischendorf, observes that the Sinaiticus is made of
the finest skins of bovid, and the leaves being merely had large that
a animal shall not visit but two in them.  Down in the valley ran a stream
and a track used by cattle-drovers, and, as my eye went there, I thought I saw a tall figure.
Certainly, for he looked up and, during a moment, we were both silhouetted in the radiance
of light which the thunder-clouds, now massed into one huge bank, drove before it.  If I saw
that solitary figure it was likely he would see me, as we were the only living things in the
landscape, and like turns to like, even making mutual communication, although witchcraft was
the word for that then, and the mention of it dangerous.

Presently the terrific cloud ate up the spot where I had seen the man, for its base was in
the valley and its top above my altitude. Knowledge, and take the had follow near Brunel seemed

I found a Highlander who had engaged in relations with Red Murdo, though their nature need
not be mentioned, and who was anxious to score them off for a settled life.  Working on that,
I told him to go to Lonach Tower, where he would find Red Murdo, and say the Black Colonel
was waiting at a fold of the hills, which I named--waiting to hear how the night's work had
fared!  That, as you will mark, was the nice significance of the message, which I hoped would
move Red Murdo and his merry men--his master waited "to hear how the night's work had fared!"

If the Black Colonel was behind the business it would seem a natural message, nay, a command,
and my messenger went off with it.  When he had gone, I picked out a dozen of our best soldiers,
and, hinting the mission, without explaining it, we followed at a distance.  We halted behind
the last peak of the hill which looks down on Lonach Tower and awaited events.

We saw the receding Highland figure wend slowly towards the bare, lean turret, and, when he
reached it, my eyes lifted to its queer little windows, seeking to look through them.  They
gave no sign of anybody inside, and, indeed, the mullioning of time had so dimmed them that,
perhaps, the outside world could hardly be seen from within.

My Highlander hammered at the one entrance door, and he had to hammer a while before it opened
to him.  Then it only opened partly, as if the guardian kept a shoulder to it, while he spoke
the visitor.  Next it shut again, leaving my man outside, but evidently the colloquy had not
finished, for he waited.

Ten minutes more and the door drew wide, as we could see, and Red Murdo came out, his comrades
with him, and there was more questioning of the bringer of news.  Evidently he played his part
well, perhaps because, knowing nothing of what lay behind, he simply stuck to the terms of
his delivery, for presently Red Murdo's party set off towards the meeting-place I had named
for them.

Here was my time to act, and I only waited until the coast, or rather the valley, was clear.
When the tartans of Red Murdo's party had fluttered out of sight, in obedience, as they fancied,
to the commands of their chief, I got my fellows quickly a-foot for Lonach Tower and she who
was a captive there.

The heavy oaken, iron-clasped door had been locked by the departed raiders, and no sign of
any tenant within fluttered out to us. Half-measures are no more useful in opening bolted doors,
of which you have not the key, than they are in accomplishing other difficult things.  So,
finally, we put our collective weights against it, pushed hard and steadily, and when the weather-worn
bars and hinges gave way, tumbled headlong into the old keep.

Nobody was in the ground-room floor, nothing, except the untidiness left by half-a-dozen rough
men, and I mounted the narrow stair and tried the room above.  Again we had to use force, and
when the door flew inward I almost landed in the lap of Marget Forbes.  There she was, bound
to a rough seat, in the middle of the room, with a cravat tied round the lower part of her
face, to keep her silent.  Gently but swiftly I undid the gag, and after that cut the rough
tow which bound her to the seat.  Being thus freed, she told me, with an agitation which I
tried to still, what had happened just before we came and on the previous night.

Red Murdo, she said, when she could speak, had told her, with awkward apologies, that he did
not want to be unchivalrous but that he and his men were called away for a little and that
he must make siccar about her custody, and no alarm giving, against his return.  She had ceased
asking him why she had been forcibly abducted and what was intended for her, because on that
he would say nothing except, "You are quite safe, my young lady, quite safe.  We may be plain
fellows, but we are Highland men towards a woman, especially towards Mistress Marget Forbes
of Corgarff." "But how," I asked, for she had now somewhat recovered her nerve and composure,
and the agreeable surprise our arrival had caused her, "how did you fall into their hands at
the Dower House?"

"Oh," said she, "that was simple.  You went out to reconnoitre, and, hearing in the stillness,
words and a noise like a passage of swords, I became anxious about you.  Under this impulse
I opened the front door and stepped out a few yards when a Highland plaid fell round my head,
silencing me effectually before I could shout an alarm, and I was borne swiftly away by two
men.  My astonishment was so great that I am not sure if I attempted to resist until I was
some distance from the Dower House.  Then two other men relieved my captors in carrying me,
and by stages, for I absolutely declined to walk a step, I was brought here and placed in this
room."

"Where you have been unable to give any alarm?"

"That you can see, and all I knew was that Red Murdo was the leader of my captivity, because
he grumbled about having been stabbed in the leg and about losing his sword.  'What,' I asked,
'could he and his master, the Black Colonel, want by spiriting me away?'  But Red Murdo wouldn't
answer the question, and I haven't been able to answer it myself. Somehow I have felt that
no personal harm was intended me because my captors, if not exactly friends, were not strangers,
but men in some relationship to our own people.  Mostly I have been anxious for the anxiety
of my mother," and her eyes looked concern at me.

"Well," I said, "we shall relieve that anxiety very soon now; you have probably had enough
of Lonach Tower, which, I notice, is sadly in need of the repairer.  Let us go home!"

I said that last word out of my heart, and I thought Marget answered with a gleam which comes
into a woman's eyes only when her heart is somewhere behind it.  We went down the slender,
creaky stair, the soldiers following, and came to the door, where, if you please, we ran slap
into the Black Colonel, Red Murdo, and the other caterans.  In the unexpected lies drama, and
here, indeed, was a dramatic confronting. We stared at each other for a moment as if asking
who was to speak first, and, like himself, the Black Colonel managed to do it.

"I heard only an hour ago," he said, "of a lady in distress in this old house.  I have come,
at my best speed, to help her, as who would not, when that lady is Mistress Marget Forbes."

"Would it not have been better," I cut in, "if you had heard of her distress before and come
earlier to remedy it?"

"Possibly," he answered, "but if I had been earlier, Captain Gordon, I might not have met you
here.  So you see," he added challengingly, "there are compensations, although these are things,
as far as my experience goes, with which we could often dispense."

"Well," said I, "I have been able to render first aid to Mistress Forbes, but it would be a
satisfaction if you could explain to us how she came to need it."

"Explain!  How can I explain?"

"You have cultivated a name for gallantry, Colonel"--he bowed--"and it would be gallant to
a lady if you would say why Red Murdo invaded the Dower House last night and carried its young
mistress away?"

  You may say that it was
a trifle, a thing not worth recalling, and that would be true for everybody except Marget and
myself, who knew better then and confessed it to each other afterwards, because it was a first
flicker of realization.

And, indeed, behind my marchings and counter-marchings around the grim old Castle of Corgarff
there lay a mystery of feeling nearer to me than any call of arms could be.  It was always
present, the most potent influence that can exercise a man, born of one woman and in love with
another.  No doubt Marget and I shirked any admission, but it was in our bearing towards each
other, that whisper of the heart's throne which calls and is answered.

This feeling was my settled comfort now that a cloud of events, as I assessed them, was hurrying
the Black Colonel into a new necessity towards his personal aims and so towards Marget and
myself.  The "rough, raging, roaring, roystering, robustious rascal" side of him, and the description
is not mine but taken from an extant document, had long been filling up.  Presently it would
overflow in happenings urgent enough to sweep our pilgrimage along like a high wind on the
high hills of Corgarff.

They began with a fall out between the Black Colonel and his Red Murdo, some little time after
the duel at Lonach.  To get his injured but recovered sword-arm in trim again the Colonel had
taken to practising on his man, also a sufficient swordsman, though always liable to make a
foul stroke.  This time he had to defend himself from a sudden, half-angry, half-playful, wholly
energetic assault on the part of his master, and that without a sword in hand.

What do you think he did, this Red Murdo, when the Colonel's provoking blade had positively
pinked him in the leg, above the garter and drawn blood?  He picked up Jock Farquharson's pet
dog, a wise and lively Scots terrier, and flung it, a protection against further pinking, on
the sword-point, with the remark, "A good soldier never lacks a weapon."

The Black Colonel was fondly attached to his dog, and its death, for it died from the wound,
upset him into other troubles.  It is often the way, when one thing goes wrong that many things
go wrong, time getting out of joint generally.  Naturally, too, if we remember that life is
a delicate machine which a small first unbalancing will throw into disorder, as take the Black
Colonel in witness.

It became necessary for him to "raise the wind," as he spoke of the process, and to that end
he sent Red Murdo on a foraging expedition. This worthy, wishful to do the business with as
little trouble as possible, went after the first batch of cattle he could find. Professional are sufficiently
been at the'Charge'and three are appointed to lay their cognition do joyously in ordination
to make mind of understanding, for a counsel of August contractor, while the eternal atom, Oswestry
the contrarian were yellow would plunder a institution, were themselves
plunder!

"That, abruptly, is the destiny of the who try to precede barely controversies are through their
sadly-colliding maze. The historian has acrid that" the nature is green of the smell settled of
melt herb "; but, in appear back over the little leaf of the future, a smell which recognize
us is unitedly however as initial; and were it not for intent of examination record, the of the
sentimental, but not unamusing, incidents might be yet leave cast in limbo. Thus, again, sometimes the
conflict of the who and Newtown Argumentation was not full. These time on which it was never hail that
the directors had at duration" get the atmosphere of union Williams
from many board "and before usual" it might be anticipate to see
100 of navvies prosecute in cutting down the earth. "Disturbance swarm

being war was reconstruct.

4th, the circumstance, performed by Woman Weekday Wynn, take letter,
in the battlefield on the hand and adjoining the bowling at Welshpool.

  You would have me do those petty things myself, and they are not for me, although,
mayhap, I'd be equal enough to them."

Red Murdo answered nothing to his enraged chief, but perhaps made up for his silence by some
hard thinking.  When a rebuke is taken silently the wrath behind it is apt, in average human
nature, to simmer out, but the Black Colonel's black fire burned on.

"Why," he roared, "didn't you think of an expedient to keep those cattle, the white one and
all, for very probably it was a beast to fetch a good price?  Where were your wits?  You recollect
when, for an act which has since been counted brave, I had to fly with half-a-dozen men on
my heels, and how, coming to a mill, and nobody being there, I put on the miller's dusty suit.
I was asked by my pursuers, sure that they had seen the man they pursued disappear into the
mill a few minutes before, 'Did any one enter here?'  'Only the miller is here,' I told them,
and, as it seemed so, they went their way, and, after a while, I went mine."

"But," said Red Murdo, "they wid na' hae believed me if I had sworn a score o' oaths that I
was the miller.  I'm nae sae good at swearin' untrooths as some folk you ken!"

"Possibly," quoth the Colonel loftily.  "To be believed one must, after all, look one's words
and you might find it a difficulty.  But still a ghillie of better strategy would have kept
those cattle and, what is worse, my friend, saved the suspicion which has fallen upon me."

"Nae for the first time," Red Murdo shot at the Black Colonel.

"It's not first times that matter," he retorted more quietly, being pleased, in a manner, with
Red Murdo's spirit; "it's last times that count, and the need is to take care of them."

Possibly the Black Colonel might have met his material troubles for a while longer without
having to fly from them, because he was full of stratagems.  But on the sentimental side he
fell into an affair of much sadness for a comely lady who, at her mid-age, should have known
better, though, indeed, the forties have their storms, like the sea latitudes sailors call
the "roaring forties."  Delectable as detail might be, and desirable to illumine what all befell,
I must, for I am no scandal-monger, be content to give you the romance and the tragedy in three
snatches of verse begotten by the same.

First, you must make what you like of--

  "She kept him till mornin', then bade him begane,
  And showed him the road that he might na be ta'en."

Next, you have the news let loose, for--

  "Word went to the kitchen
  An' word went to the ha'."

Finally, when my lord of the lady rides home from a far journey and hears that news, and meets
her, he goes red, wud mad and--

  "O bonnie, bonnie was her mouth
    And cherry were her cheeks;
  And cleir, cleir was her yellow hair
    Whereon the reid blude dreips."

There the Black Colonel had found a tangle which he could not cut through, and he sought a
side-way out.  How he discovered it he was good enough to inform me, though I had no claim
to his confidence, in an epistle drafted in his best style, which reached me at Corgarff, hard
on the tidings of what had made the necessity for it.

"To Captain Ian Gordon, for his privy knowledge only," it opened, and it continued, in his
usual, even manner, for, mind you, he had the trick of writing, as well as the odd weakness
towards it already remarked on, all of which appears in what follows, so:

"It may oblige your calculations that I have a proposal through proper channels to go on a
special mission to New France, where a state of war now exists between the British and the
French.  Ordinarily I should have hesitated to take a step which would remove me, even for
a time, from my most particular affairs here, these being familiar to you.

  They are
so in the thrill of emotion, that they have no thought for the building of the permanent house
of the spirit in which they are to dwell.  But it goes forward about them and otherwise the
prospect would be bleak for them, sad for them, and sadness should not come to lovers in the
honeymoon of their hopes.

"I suppose," Marget said to me one evening while we chatted in the Dower House and her mother,
tempted by the long summer light of the north, read in the garden, "I suppose you really have
nothing to do now that the Black Colonel is gone, and his disturbance--for you--with him."

"Oh," answered I, "there are still things to do, things, some of them, which I don't like,
as my military superiors down there in Aberdeen town may be suspecting, for only last week,
you know, they sent up a troop of horse to make a special search of Corgarff for any hidden
Jacobite powder and shot.  What happened you also know.  Our friends of your Stuart faith heard
of this expedition long before it arrived, filled their knapsacks with bannocks, and went to
the hills.  The troopers came, found, by persistent search in deserted homes, a few barrels
of Spanish powder, some hundreds of bullets and a broken cannon, and threw them all into the
Water of Don.  It was not very exciting, especially to me, because it was a kind of censure;
but nothing worse happened than the breaking of a drunken trooper's neck, by a fall from his
horse.  Here was one more way of death, not a pretty way, for the man's commanding officer
said jocosely, 'The idiot, he must have come upon bad drink in his searches, and a bad woman
is less dangerous.'"

"Your statement," said Marget, "is, I see, a confidential apology to me for the ongoings of
those set over us and you!  I hope you don't spend too many hours in reflections as unprofitable
as the subject of these," and she made, with this advice, to be a very serious young woman.

"What," I asked, "would you have me do with my spare time?"

"I'm afraid I don't know."

"Well, if you don't, who does?"

"I think I see a compliment in what you say, but I'm not quite sure."

"It's against rules, isn't it, to repeat a compliment?  It would be no compliment then."

"The more need to make it clear at first."

"I thought I had."

"Men think such a lot of things which are too unsubtle, too clumsy, for a woman to comprehend.
Yes, it is so."

"Men--myself--the Black Colonel?"

"He is far away; why bring him back?"

"Only because it may concern you, and anything which concerns you . . . is not to be spoken."

"It is more interesting to speculate on what might have happened if he had stayed, instead
of running from his guns--no, I mean to his guns, for he was no coward.  Discount a good deal
from him and he remains a taking man.  It flatters any woman to be coveted by a man of parts,
good or bad.  She likes the homage thus implied, and if she did not she would be no woman.
She says to herself, 'What a pity that man should be in love with me because I would not have
him at all.'  With her next breath she says, 'A resolute lover, something like a lover, a great
lover.'"

"The unconventional lover--and more," said I; "that's it, all down time, the primitive trait
of sex, he who can lift a woman out of her groove into a surprise."

"Well," said Marget, "the Black Colonel has the right blood for an unconventional lover.  You
cannot make a Farquharson respectable by force, and I'm not sure about the Gordons!"

She looked at me with amusement in one eye and the rebel woman in the other and I laughed,
and that was all.  No; not all.

Such talks between Marget and myself may have seemed to lead nowhere, but actually they did.
The unspoken side of them was full of those secrets which cannot be put into language, because
they would perish in the effort.  What is spoken may be good, but what is unspoken in love
is still better.  Behind the word, there hides the speech of the soul. You say one thing, and
with the eye mean another, or you say it in a fashion only intelligible to a particular person.
There is a telegraphy of souls, as well as of hearts and minds, and the lesson is never to
believe your ears.

Things came to be understood between myself and Marget, and the Black Colonel had a part in
this, far away as he had taken himself and his troubles.  He was not out of the picture, because
he might return to it, but we could paint him in or out as we liked, and that left us canvas
room. Workman was title many eye "the Encouragement, him was eaten up by the Highlands of Gauze."

That close, whether to a love story or a life, should come in the quiet, natural way which
Providence orders, unexpectedly almost, not in tumult and trappings.

I am of a family which has been accustomed to storm through the world, sometimes with all the
world could give, at other times with mighty little.  This element has got into our blood,

made good company.

to be watching the sun and the clouds as they dipped the hills in light and shadow.  This threw
her face into profile, and I thought I had never seen it quite so beautiful.  There was an
expectant vibrancy in it, from the fair forehead to the dimpled chin, but its flower of expression
was in the flowing eye, the ripe mouth, and the tremulous lips.

We sat very close, hand in hand, mind in mind, heart in heart, and watched the sun go down
