Early in the spring he removed to Serravezza, and resumed the work of bringing down his blocked-out
columns from the quarries. One of these pillars, six of which he says were finished, was of
huge size, intended probably for the flanks to the main door at S. Lorenzo. It tumbled into
the river, and was smashed to pieces. Michelangelo attributed the accident solely to the bad
quality of iron which a rascally fellow had put into the lewis-ring by means of which the block
was being raised. On this occasion he again ran considerable risk of injury, and suffered great
annoyance. The following letter of condolence, written by Jacopo Salviati, proves how much
he was grieved, and also shows that he lived on excellent terms with the Pope's right-hand
man and counsellor: "Keep up your spirits and proceed gallantly with your great enterprise,
for your honour requires this, seeing you have commenced the work. Confide in me; nothing will
be amiss with you, and our Lord is certain to compensate you for far greater losses than this.
Have no doubt upon this point, and if you want one thing more than another, let me know, and
you shall be served immediately. Remember that your undertaking a work of such magnitude will
lay our city under the deepest obligation, not only to yourself, but also to your family for
ever. Great men, and of courageous spirit, take heart under adversities, and become more energetic."

A pleasant thread runs through Michelangelo's correspondence during these years. It is the
affection he felt for his workman Pietro Urbano. When he leaves the young man behind him at
Florence, he writes frequently, giving him advice, bidding him mind his studies, and also telling
him to confess. It happened that Urbano fell ill at Carrara, toward the end of August. Michelangelo,
on hearing the news, left Florence and travelled by post to Carrara. Thence he had his friend
transported on the backs of men to Serravezza, and after his recovery sent him to pick up strength
in his native city of Pistoja. In one of the Ricordi he reckons the cost of all this at 33-1/2
ducats.

While Michelangelo was residing at Pietra Santa in 1518, his old friend and fellow-worker,
Pietro Rosselli, wrote to him from Rome, asking his advice about a tabernacle of marble which
Pietro Soderini had ordered. It was to contain the head of S. John the Baptist, and to be placed
in the Church of the Convent of S. Silvestro. On the 7th of June Soderini wrote upon the same
topic, requesting a design. This Michelangelo sent in October, the execution of the shrine
being intrusted to Federigo Frizzi. The incident would hardly be worth mentioning, except for
the fact that it brings to mind one of Michelangelo's earliest patrons, the good-hearted Gonfalonier
of Justice, and anticipates the coming of the only woman he is known to have cared for, Vittoria
Colonna. It was at S. Silvestro that she dwelt, retired in widowhood, and here occurred those
Sunday morning conversations of which Francesco d'Olanda has left us so interesting a record.

During the next year, 1519, a certain Tommaso di Dolfo invited him to visit Adrianople. He
reminded him how, coming together in Florence, when Michelangelo lay there in hiding from Pope
Julius, they had talked about the East, and he had expressed a wish to travel into Turkey.
Tommaso di Dolfo dissuaded him on that occasion, because the ruler of the province was a man
of no taste and careless about the arts. Things had altered since, and he thought there was
a good opening for an able sculptor. Things, however, had altered in Italy also, and Buonarroti
felt no need to quit the country where his fame was growing daily.

Considerable animation is introduced into the annals of Michelangelo's life at this point by
his correspondence with jovial Sebastiano del Piombo. We possess one of this painter's letters,
dating as early as 1510, when he thanks Buonarroti for consenting to be godfather to his boy
Luciano; a second of 1512, which contains the interesting account of his conversation with
Pope Julius about Michelangelo and Raffaello; and a third, of 1518, turning upon the rivalry
between the two great artists. But the bulk of Sebastiano's gossipy and racy communications
belongs to the period of thirteen years between 1520 and 1533; then it suddenly breaks off,
owing to Michelangelo's having taken up his residence at Rome during the autumn of 1533. A
definite rupture at some subsequent period separated the old friends. These letters are a mine
of curious information respecting artistic life at Rome. They prove, beyond the possibility
of doubt, that, whatever Buonarroti and Sanzio may have felt, their flatterers, dependants,
and creatures cherished the liveliest hostility and lived in continual rivalry. It is somewhat
painful to think that Michelangelo could have lent a willing ear to the malignant babble of
a man so much inferior to himself in nobleness of nature--have listened when Sebastiano taunted
Raffaello as "Prince of the Synagogue," or boasted that a picture of his own was superior to
"the tapestries just come from Flanders." Yet Sebastiano was not the only friend to whose idle
gossip the great sculptor indulgently stooped. Lionardo, the saddle-maker, was even more offensive.
He writes, for instance, upon New Year's Day, 1519, to say that the Resurrection of Lazarus,
for which Michelangelo had contributed some portion of the design, was nearly finished, and
adds: "Those who understand art rank it far above Raffaello. The vault, too, of Agostino Chigi
has been exposed to view, and is a thing truly disgraceful to a great artist, far worse than
the last hall of the Palace. Sebastiano has nothing to fear."

We gladly turn from these quarrels to what Sebastiano teaches us about Michelangelo's personal
character. The general impression in the world was that he was very difficult to live with.
Julius, for instance, after remarking that Raffaello changed his style in imitation of Buonarroti,
continued: "'But he is terrible, as you see; one cannot get on with him.' I answered to his
Holiness that your terribleness hurt nobody, and that you only seem to be terrible because
of your passionate devotion to the great works you have on hand." Again, he relates Leo's estimate
of his friend's character:

"I know in what esteem the Pope holds you, and when he speaks of you, it would seem that he
were talking about a brother, almost with tears in his eyes; for he has told me you were brought
up together as boys" (Giovanni de' Medici and the sculptor were exactly of the same age), "and
shows that he knows and loves you. But you frighten everybody, even Popes!" Michelangelo must
have complained of this last remark, for Sebastiano, in a letter dated a few days later, reverts
to the subject: "Touching what you reply to me about your terribleness, I, for my part, do
not esteem you terrible; and if I have not written on this subject do not be surprised, seeing
you do not strike me as terrible, except only in art--that is to say, in being the greatest
master who ever lived: that is my opinion; if I am in error, the loss is mine." Later on, he
tells us what Clement VII. thought: "One letter to your friend (the Pope) would be enough;
you would soon see what fruit it bore; because I know how he values you. He loves you, knows
your nature, adores your work, and tastes its quality as much as it is possible for man to
do. Indeed, his appreciation is miraculous, and such as ought to give great satisfaction to
an artist. He speaks of you so honourably, and with such loving affection, that a father could
not say of a son what he does of you. It is true that he has been grieved at times by buzzings
in his ear about you at the time of the siege of Florence. He shrugged his shoulders and cried,
'Michelangelo is in the wrong; I never did him any injury.'" It is interesting to find Sebastiano,
in the same letter, complaining of Michelangelo's sensitiveness. "One favour I would request
of you, that is, that you should come to learn your worth, and not stoop as you do to every
little thing, and remember that eagles do not prey on flies. Enough! I know that you will laugh
at my prattle; but I do not care; Nature has made me so, and I am not Zuan da Rezzo."

VIII

The year 1520 was one of much importance for Michelangelo. A Ricordo dated March 10 gives a
brief account of the last four years, winding up with the notice that "Pope Leo, perhaps because
he wants to get the façade at S. Lorenzo finished quicker than according to the contract made
with me, and I also consenting thereto, sets me free ... and so he leaves me at liberty, under
no obligation of accounting to any one for anything which I have had to do with him or others
upon his account." I have he do reckon me have the entrance.

 I am sorry for
him since, after all, he is but young."

Such was the end of Pietro Urbano. Michelangelo was certainly unfortunate with his apprentices.
One cannot help fancying he may have spoiled them by indulgence. Vasari, mentioning Pietro,
calls him "a person of talent, but one who never took the pains to work."

Frizzi brought the Christ Triumphant into its present state, patching up what "the lither lad"
from Pistoja had boggled. Buonarroti, who was sincerely attached to Varj, and felt his artistic
reputation now at stake, offered to make a new statue. But the magnanimous Roman gentleman
replied that he was entirely satisfied with the one he had received. He regarded and esteemed
it "as a thing of gold," and, in refusing Michelangelo's offer, added that "this proved his
noble soul and generosity, inasmuch as, when he had already made what could not be surpassed
and was incomparable, he still wanted to serve his friend better." The price originally stipulated
was paid, and Varj added an autograph testimonial, strongly affirming his contentment with
the whole transaction.

These details prove that the Christ of the Minerva must be regarded as a mutilated masterpiece.
Michelangelo is certainly responsible for the general conception, the pose, and a large portion
of the finished surface, details of which, especially in the knees, so much admired by Sebastiano,
and in the robust arms, are magnificent. He designed the figure wholly nude, so that the heavy
bronze drapery which now surrounds the loins, and bulges drooping from the left hip, breaks
the intended harmony of lines. Yet, could this brawny man have ever suggested any distinctly
religious idea? Christ, victor over Death and Hell, did not triumph by ponderosity and sinews.
The spiritual nature of his conquest, the ideality of a divine soul disencumbered from the
flesh, to which it once had stooped in love for sinful man, ought certainly to have been emphasised,
if anywhere through art, in the statue of a Risen Christ. Substitute a scaling-ladder for the
cross, and here we have a fine life-guardsman, stripped and posing for some classic battle-piece.
We cannot quarrel with Michelangelo about the face and head. Those vulgarly handsome features,
that beard, pomaded and curled by a barber's 'prentice, betray no signs of his inspiration.
Only in the arrangement of the hair, hyacinthine locks descending to the shoulders, do we recognise
the touch of the divine sculptor.

The Christ became very famous. Francis I. had it cast and sent to Paris, to be repeated in
bronze. What is more strange, it has long been the object of a religious cult. The right foot,
so mangled by poor Pietro, wears a fine brass shoe, in order to prevent its being kissed away.
This almost makes one think of Goethe's hexameter: "Wunderthätige Bilder sind meist nur schlechte
Gemälde." Still it must be remembered that excellent critics have found the whole work admirable.
Gsell-Fels says: "It is his second Moses; in movement and physique one of the greatest masterpieces;
as a Christ-ideal, the heroic conception of a humanist." That last observation is just. We
may remember that Vida was composing his Christiad while Frizzi was curling the beard of the
Cristo Risorto. Vida always speaks of Jesus as Heros and of God the Father as Superum Pater
Nimbipotens or Regnator Olympi.

CHAPTER VIII

I

Leo X. expired upon the 1st day of December 1521. The vacillating game he played in European
politics had just been crowned with momentary success. Some folk believed that the Pope died
of joy after hearing that his Imperial allies had entered the town of Milan; others thought
that he succumbed to poison. We do not know what caused his death. But the unsoundness of his
constitution, over-taxed by dissipation and generous living, in the midst of public cares for
which the man had hardly nerve enough, may suffice to account for a decease certainly sudden
and premature. Michelangelo, born in the same year, was destined to survive him through more
than eight lustres of the life of man.

Leo was a personality whom it is impossible to praise without reserve. The Pope at that time
in Italy had to perform three separate functions. His first duty was to the Church. Leo left
the See of Rome worse off than he found it: financially bankrupt, compromised by vague schemes
set on foot for the aggrandisement of his family, discredited by many shameless means for raising
money upon spiritual securities. His second duty was to Italy. Leo left the peninsula so involved
in a mesh of meaningless entanglements, diplomatic and aimless wars, that anarchy and violence
proved to be the only exit from the situation. His third duty was to that higher culture which
Italy dispensed to Europe, and of which the Papacy had made itself the leading propagator.
Here Leo failed almost as conspicuously as in all else he attempted. He debased the standard
of art and literature by his ill-placed liberalities, seeking quick returns for careless expenditure,
not selecting the finest spirits of his age for timely patronage, diffusing no lofty enthusiasm,
but breeding round him mushrooms of mediocrity.

Nothing casts stronger light upon the low tone of Roman society created by Leo than the outburst
of frenzy and execration which exploded when a Fleming was elected as his successor. Adrian
Florent, belonging to a family surnamed Dedel, emerged from the scrutiny of the Conclave into
the pontifical chair. He had been the tutor of Charles V., and this may suffice to account
for his nomination. Cynical wits ascribed that circumstance to the direct and unexpected action
of the Holy Ghost. He was the one foreigner who occupied the seat of S. Peter after the period
when the metropolis of Western Christendom became an Italian principality. Adrian, by his virtues
and his failings, proved that modern Rome, in her social corruption and religious indifference,
demanded an Italian Pontiff. Single-minded and simple, raised unexpectedly by circumstances
into his supreme position, he shut his eyes absolutely to art and culture, abandoned diplomacy,
and determined to act only as the chief of the Catholic Church. In ecclesiastical matters Adrian
was undoubtedly a worthy man. He returned to the original conception of his duty as the Primate
of Occidental Christendom; and what might have happened had he lived to impress his spirit
upon Rome, remains beyond the reach of calculation. Dare we conjecture that the sack of 1527
would have been averted?

Adrian reigned only a year and eight months. He had no time to do anything of permanent value,
and was hardly powerful enough to do it, even if time and opportunity had been afforded. In
the thunderstorm gathering over Rome and the Papacy, he represents that momentary lull during
which men hold their breath and murmur. All the place-seekers, parasites, flatterers, second-rate
artificers, folk of facile talents, whom Leo gathered round him, vented their rage against
a Pope who lived sparsely, shut up the Belvedere, called statues "idols of the Pagans," and
spent no farthing upon twangling lutes and frescoed chambers. Truly Adrian is one of the most
grotesque and significant figures upon the page of modern history. His personal worth, his
inadequacy to the needs of the age, and his incompetence to control the tempest loosed by Della
Roveres, Borgias, and Medici around him, give the man a tragic irony.

After his death, upon the 23rd of September 1523, the Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was made Pope.
He assumed the title of Clement VII. upon the 9th of November. The wits who saluted Adrian's
doctor with the title of "Saviour of the Fatherland," now rejoiced at the election of an Italian
and a Medici. The golden years of Leo's reign would certainly return, they thought; having
no foreknowledge of the tragedy which was so soon to be enacted, first at Rome, and afterwards
at Florence, Michelangelo wrote to his friend Topolino at Carrara: "You will have heard that
Medici is made Pope; all the world seems to me to be delighted, and I think that here at Florence
great things will soon be set on foot in our art. Therefore, serve well and faithfully."

II

Our records are very scanty, both as regards personal details and art-work, for the life of
Michelangelo during the pontificate of Adrian VI. The high esteem in which he was held throughout
Italy is proved by three incidents which may shortly be related. In 1522, the Board of Works
for the cathedral church of S. Petronio at Bologna decided to complete the façade. Various
architects sent in designs; among them Peruzzi competed with one in the Gothic style, and another
in that of the Classical revival. Great differences of opinion arose in the city as to the
merits of the rival plans, and the Board in July invited Michelangelo, through their secretary,
to come and act as umpire. They promised to reward him magnificently. It does not appear that
Michelangelo accepted the offer. In 1523, Cardinal Grimani, who was a famous collector of art-objects,
wrote begging for some specimen of his craft. Grimani left it open to him "to choose material
and subject; painting, bronze, or marble, according to his fancy." Michelangelo must have promised
to fulfill the commission, for we have a letter from Grimani thanking him effusively. He offers
to pay fifty ducats at the commencement of the work, and what Michelangelo thinks fit to demand
at its conclusion: "for such is the excellence of your ability, that we shall take no thought
of money-value." Grimani was Patriarch of Aquileja. In the same year, 1523, the Genoese entered
into negotiations for a colossal statue of Andrea Doria, which they desired to obtain from
the hand of Michelangelo. Its execution must have been seriously contemplated, for the Senate
of Genoa banked 300 ducats for the purpose. We regret that Michelangelo could not carry out
a work so congenial to his talent as this ideal portrait of the mighty Signer Capitano would
have been; but we may console ourselves by reflecting that even his energies were not equal
to all tasks imposed upon him. The real matter for lamentation is that they suffered so much
waste in the service of vacillating Popes.

To the year 1523 belongs, in all probability, the last extant letter which Michelangelo wrote
to his father. Lodovico was dissatisfied with a contract which had been drawn up on the 16th
of June in that year, and by which a certain sum of money, belonging to the dowry of his late
wife, was settled in reversion upon his eldest son. Michelangelo explains the tenor of the
deed, and then breaks forth into the, following bitter and ironical invective: "If my life
is a nuisance to you, you have found the means of protecting yourself, and will inherit the
key of that treasure which you say that I possess. And you will be acting rightly; for all
Florence knows how mighty rich you were, and how I always robbed you, and deserve to be chastised.
Highly will men think of you for this. Cry out and tell folk all you choose about me, but do
not write again, for you prevent my working. What I have now to do is to make good all you
have had from me during the past five-and-twenty years. I would rather not tell you this, but
I cannot help it. Take care, and be on your guard against those whom it concerns you. A man
dies but once, and does not come back again to patch up things ill done. You have put off till
the death to do this. May God assist you!"

In another draft of this letter Lodovico is accused of going about the town complaining that
he was once a rich man, and that Michelangelo had robbed him. Still, we must not take this
for proved; one of the great artist's main defects was an irritable suspiciousness, which caused
him often to exaggerate slights and to fancy insults. He may have attached too much weight
to the grumblings of an old man, whom at the bottom of his heart he loved dearly.

III

Clement, immediately after his election, resolved on setting Michelangelo at work in earnest
on the Sacristy. At the very beginning of January he also projected the building of the Laurentian
Library, and wrote, through his Roman agent, Giovanni Francesco Fattucci, requesting to have
two plans furnished, one in the Greek, the other in the Latin style. Michelangelo replied as
follows: "I gather from your last that his Holiness our Lord wishes that I should furnish the
design for the library. I have received no information, and do not know where it is to be erected.
It is true that Stefano talked to me about the scheme, but I paid no heed. When he returns
from Carrara I will inquire, and will do all that is in my power, albeit architecture is not
my profession." There is something pathetic in this reiterated assertion that his real art
was sculpture. At the same time Clement wished to provide for him for life. He first proposed
that Buonarroti should promise not to marry, and should enter into minor orders. This would
have enabled him to enjoy some ecclesiastical benefice, but it would also have handed him over
firmly bound to the service of the Pope. Circumstances already hampered him enough, and Michelangelo,
who chose to remain his own master, refused. As Berni wrote: "Voleva far da se, non comandato."
As an alternative, a pension was suggested. It appears that he only asked for fifteen ducats
a month, and that his friend Pietro Gondi had proposed twenty-five ducats. Fattucci, on the
13th of January 1524, rebuked him in affectionate terms for his want of pluck, informing him
that "Jacopo Salviati has given orders that Spina should be instructed to pay you a monthly
provision of fifty ducats." Moreover, all the disbursements made for the work at S. Lorenzo
were to be provided by the same agent in Florence, and to pass through Michelangelo's hands.
A house was assigned him, free of rent, at S. Lorenzo, in order that he might be near his work.
Henceforth he was in almost weekly correspondence with Giovanni Spina on affairs of business,
sending in accounts and drawing money by means of his then trusted servant, Stefano, the miniaturist.

That Stefano did not always behave himself according to his master's wishes appears from the
following characteristic letter addressed by Michelangelo to his friend Pietro Gondi: "The
poor man, who is ungrateful, has a nature of this sort, that if you help him in his needs,
he says that what you gave him came out of superfluities; if you put him in the way of doing
work for his own good, he says you were obliged, and set him to do it because you were incapable;
and all the benefits which he received he ascribes to the necessities of the benefactor. But
when everybody can see that you acted out of pure benevolence, the ingrate waits until you
make some public mistake, which gives him the opportunity of maligning his benefactor and winning
credence, in order to free himself from the obligation under which he lies. This has invariably
happened in my case. No one ever entered into relations with me--I speak of workmen--to whom
I did not do good with all my heart. Afterwards, some trick of temper, or some madness, which
they say is in my nature, which hurts nobody except myself, gives them an excuse for speaking
evil of me and calumniating my character. Such is the reward of all honest men."

These general remarks, he adds, apply to Stefano, whom he placed in a position of trust and
responsibility, in order to assist him. "What I do is done for his good, because I have undertaken
to benefit the man, and cannot abandon him; but let him not imagine or say that I am doing
it because of my necessities, for, God be praised, I do not stand in need of men." He then
begs Gondi to discover what Stefano's real mind is. This is a matter of great importance to
him for several reasons, and especially for this: "If I omitted to justify myself, and were
to put another in his place, I should be published among the Piagnoni for the biggest traitor
who ever lived, even though I were in the right."

We conclude, then, that Michelangelo thought of dismissing Stefano, but feared lest he should
get into trouble with the powerful political party, followers of Savonarola, who bore the name
of Piagnoni at Florence. Gondi must have patched the quarrel up, for we still find Stefano's
name in the Ricordi down to April 4, 1524. Shortly after that date, Antonio Mini seems to have
taken his place as Michelangelo's right-hand man of business. These details are not so insignificant
as they appear. They enable us to infer that the Sacristy of S. Lorenzo may have been walled
and roofed in before the end of April 1524; for, in an undated letter to Pope Clement, Michelangelo
says that Stefano has finished the lantern, and that it is universally admired. With regard
to this lantern, folk told him that he would make it better than Brunelleschi's. "Different
perhaps, but better, no!" he answered. The letter to Clement just quoted is interesting in
several respects. The boldness of the beginning makes one comprehend how Michelangelo was terrible
even to Popes:--

"Most Blessed Father,--Inasmuch as intermediates are often the cause of grave misunderstandings,
I have summoned up courage to write without their aid to your Holiness about the tombs at S.
Lorenzo. I repeat, I know not which is preferable, the evil that does good, or the good that
hurts. I am certain, mad and wicked as I may be, that if I had been allowed to go on as I had
begun, all the marbles needed for the work would have been in Florence to-day, and properly
blocked out, with less cost than has been expended on them up to this date; and they would
have been superb, as are the others I have brought here."

After this he entreats Clement to give him full authority in carrying out the work, and not
to put superiors over him. Michelangelo, we know, was extremely impatient of control and interference;
and we shall see, within a short time, how excessively the watching and spying of busybodies
worried and disturbed his spirits.

But these were not his only sources of annoyance. The heirs of Pope Julius, perceiving that
Michelangelo's time and energy were wholly absorbed at S. Lorenzo, began to threaten him with
a lawsuit. Clement, wanting apparently to mediate between the litigants, ordered Fattucci to
obtain a report from the sculptor, with a full account of how matters stood. This evoked the
long and interesting document which has been so often cited. There is no doubt whatever that
Michelangelo acutely felt the justice of the Duke of Urbino's grievances against him. He was
broken-hearted at seeming to be wanting in his sense of honour and duty. People, he says, accused
him of putting the money which had been paid for the tomb out at usury, "living meanwhile at
Florence and amusing himself." It also hurt him deeply to be distracted from the cherished
project of his early manhood in order to superintend works for which he had no enthusiasm,
and which lay outside his sphere of operation.

It may, indeed, be said that during these years Michelangelo lived in a perpetual state of
uneasiness and anxiety about the tomb of Julius. As far back as 1518 the Cardinal Leonardo
Grosso, Bishop of Agen, and one of Julius's executors, found it necessary to hearten him with
frequent letters of encouragement. In one of these, after commending his zeal in extracting
marbles and carrying on the monument, the Cardinal proceeds: "Be then of good courage, and
do not yield to any perturbations of the spirit, for we put more faith in your smallest word
than if all the world should say the contrary. We know your loyalty, and believe you to be
wholly devoted to our person; and if there shall be need of aught which we can supply, we are
willing, as we have told you on other occasions, to do so; rest then in all security of mind,
because we love you from the heart, and desire to do all that may be agreeable to you." This
good friend was dead at the time we have now reached, and the violent Duke Francesco Maria
della Rovere acted as the principal heir of Pope Julius.

In a passion of disgust he refused to draw his pension, and abandoned the house at S. Lorenzo.
This must have happened in March 1524, for his friend Leonardo writes to him from Rome upon
the 24th: "I am also told that you have declined your pension, which seems to me mere madness,
and that you have thrown the house up, and do not work. Friend and gossip, let me tell you
that you have plenty of enemies, who speak their worst; also that the Pope and Pucci and Jacopo
Salviati are your friends, and have plighted their troth to you. It is unworthy of you to break
your word to them, especially in an affair of honour. Leave the matter of the tomb to those
who wish you well, and who are able to set you free without the least encumbrance, and take
care you do not come short in the Pope's work. Die first. And take the pension, for they give
it with a willing heart." How long he remained in contumacy is not quite certain; apparently
until the 29th of August. We have a letter written on that day to Giovanni Spina: "After I
left you yesterday, I went back thinking over my affairs; and, seeing that the Pope has set
his heart on S. Lorenzo, and how he urgently requires my service, and has appointed me a good
provision in order that I may serve him with more convenience and speed; seeing also that not
to accept it keeps me back, and that I have no good excuse for not serving his Holiness; I
have changed my mind, and whereas I hitherto refused, I now demand it (i.e., the salary), considering
this far wiser, and for more reasons than I care to write; and, more especially, I mean to
return to the house you took for me at S. Lorenzo, and settle down there like an honest man:
inasmuch as it sets gossip going, and does me great damage not to go back there." From a Ricordo
dated October 19, 1524, we learn in fact that he then drew his full pay for eight months.

IV

Since Michelangelo was now engaged upon the Medicean tombs at S. Lorenzo, it will be well to
give some account of the several plans he made before deciding on the final scheme, which he
partially executed. We may assume, I think, that the sacristy, as regards its general form
and dimensions, faithfully represents the first plan approved by Clement. This follows from
the rapidity and regularity with which the structure was completed. But then came the question
of filling it with sarcophagi and statues. As early as November 28, 1520, Giulio de' Medici,
at that time Cardinal, wrote from the Villa Magliana. to Buonarroti, addressing him thus: "Spectabilis
vir, amice noster charissime." He says that he is pleased with the design for the chapel, and
with the notion of placing the four tombs in the middle. Then he proceeds to make some sensible
remarks upon the difficulty of getting these huge masses of statuary into the space provided
for them. Michelangelo, as Heath Wilson has pointed out, very slowly acquired the sense of
proportion on which technical architecture depends. His early sketches only show a feeling
for mass and picturesque effect, and a strong inclination to subordinate the building to sculpture.

It may be questioned who were the four Medici for whom these tombs were intended. Cambi, in
a passage quoted above, writing at the end of March 1520(?), says that two were raised for
Giuliano, Duke of Nemours, and Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino, and that the Cardinal meant one to
be for himself. The fourth he does not speak about. It has been conjectured that Lorenzo the
Magnificent and his brother Giuliano, fathers respectively of Leo and of Clement, were to occupy
two of the sarcophagi; and also, with greater probability, that the two Popes, Leo and Clement,
were associated with the Dukes.

Before 1524 the scheme expanded, and settled into a more definite shape. The sarcophagi were
to support statue-portraits of the Dukes and Popes, with Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother
Giuliano. At their base, upon the ground, were to repose six rivers, two for each tomb, showing
that each sepulchre would have held two figures. The rivers were perhaps Arno, Tiber, Metauro,
Po, Taro, and Ticino. This we gather from a letter written to Michelangelo on the 23rd of May
in that year. Michelangelo made designs to meet this plan, but whether the tombs were still
detached from the wall does not appear. Standing inside the sacristy, it seems impossible that
six statue-portraits and six river-gods on anything like a grand scale could have been crowded
into the space, especially when we remember that there was to be an altar, with other objects
described as ornaments--"gli altri ornamenti." Probably the Madonna and Child, with SS. Cosimo
and Damiano, now extant in the chapel, formed an integral part of the successive schemes.

One thing is certain, that the notion of placing the tombs in the middle of the sacristy was
soon abandoned. All the marble panelling, pilasters, niches, and so forth, which at present
clothe the walls and dominate the architectural effect, are clearly planned for mural monuments.
A rude sketch preserved in the Uffizi throws some light upon the intermediate stages of the
scheme. It is incomplete, and was not finally adopted; but we see in it one of the four sides
of the chapel, divided vertically above into three compartments, the middle being occupied
by a Madonna, the two at the sides filled in with bas-reliefs. At the base, on sarcophagi or
cassoni, recline two nude male figures. The space between these and the upper compartments
seems to have been reserved for allegorical figures, since a colossal naked boy, ludicrously
out of scale with the architecture and the recumbent figures, has been hastily sketched in.
In architectural proportion and sculpturesque conception this design is very poor. It has the
merit, however, of indicating a moment in the evolution of the project when the mural scheme
had been adopted. The decorative details which surmount the composition confirm the feeling
every one must have, that, in their present state, the architecture of the Medicean monuments
remains imperfect.

In this process of endeavouring to trace the development of Michelangelo's ideas for the sacristy,
seven original drawings at the British Museum are of the greatest importance. They may be divided
into three groups. One sketch seems to belong to the period when the tombs were meant to be
placed in the centre of the chapel. It shows a single facet of the monument, with two sarcophagi
placed side by side and seated figures at the angles. Five are variations upon the mural scheme,
which was eventually adopted. They differ considerably in details, proving what trouble the
designer took to combine a large number of figures in a single plan. He clearly intended at
some time to range the Medicean statues in pairs, and studied several types of curve for their
sepulchral urns. The feature common to all of them is a niche, of door or window shape, with
a powerfully indented architrave. Reminiscences of the design for the tomb of Julius are not
infrequent; and it may be remarked, as throwing a side-light upon that irrecoverable project
of his earlier manhood, that the figures posed upon the various spaces of architecture differ
in their scale. Two belonging to this series are of especial interest, since we learn from
them how he thought of introducing the rivers at the basement of the composition. It seems
that he hesitated long about the employment of circular spaces in the framework of the marble
panelling. These were finally rejected. One of the finest and most comprehensive of the drawings
I am now describing contains a rough draft of a curved sarcophagus, with an allegorical figure
reclining upon it, indicating the first conception of the Dawn. Another, blurred and indistinct,
with clumsy architectural environment, exhibits two of these allegories, arranged much as we
now see them at S. Lorenzo. A river-god, recumbent beneath the feet of a female statue, carries
the eye down to the ground, and enables us to comprehend how these subordinate figures were
wrought into the complex harmony of flowing lines he had imagined. The seventh study differs
in conception from the rest; it stands alone. There are four handlings of what begins like
a huge portal, and is gradually elaborated into an architectural scheme containing three great
niches for statuary. It is powerful and simple in design, governed by semicircular arches--a
feature which is absent from the rest.

All these drawings are indubitably by the hand of Michelangelo, and must be reckoned among
his first free efforts to construct a working plan. The Albertina Collection at Vienna yields
us an elaborate design for the sacristy, which appears to have been worked up from some of
the rougher sketches. It is executed in pen, shaded with bistre, and belongs to what I have
ventured to describe as office work. It may have been prepared for the inspection of Leo and
the Cardinal. Here we have the sarcophagi in pairs, recumbent figures stretched upon a shallow
curve inverted, colossal orders of a bastard Ionic type, a great central niche framing a seated
Madonna, two male figures in side niches, suggestive of Giuliano and Lorenzo as they were at
last conceived, four allegorical statues, and, to crown the whole structure, candelabra of
a peculiar shape, with a central round, supported by two naked genii. It is difficult, as I
have before observed, to be sure how much of the drawings executed in this way can be ascribed
with safety to Michelangelo himself. They are carefully outlined, with the precision of a working
architect; but the sculptural details bear the aspect of what may be termed a generic Florentine
style of draughtsmanship.

Two important letters from Michelangelo to Fattucci, written in October 1525 and April 1526,
show that he had then abandoned the original scheme, and adopted one which was all but carried
into effect. "I am working as hard as I can, and in fifteen days I shall begin the other captain.
Afterwards the only important things left will be the four rivers. The four statues on the
sarcophagi, the four figures on the ground which are the rivers, the two captains, and Our
Lady, who is to be placed upon the tomb at the head of the chapel; these are what I mean to
do with my own hand. Of these I have begun six; and I have good hope of finishing them in due
time, and carrying the others forward in part, which do not signify so much." The six he had
begun are clearly the Dukes and their attendant figures of Day, Night, Dawn, Evening. The Madonna,
one of his noblest works, came within a short distance of completion. SS. Cosimo and Damiano
passed into the hands of Montelupo and Montorsoli. Of the four rivers we have only fragments
in the shape of some exquisite little models. Where they could have been conveniently placed
is difficult to imagine; possibly they were abandoned from a feeling that the chapel would
be overcrowded.

V

According to the plan adopted in this book, I shall postpone such observations as I have to
make upon the Medicean monuments until the date when Michelangelo laid down his chisel, and
shall now proceed with the events of his life during the years 1525 and 1526.

He continued to be greatly troubled about the tomb of Julius II. The lawsuit instituted by
the Duke of Urbino hung over his head; and though he felt sure of the Pope's powerful support,
it was extremely important, both for his character and comfort, that affairs should be placed
upon a satisfactory basis. Fattucci in Rome acted not only as Clement's agent in business connected
with S. Lorenzo; he also was intrusted with negotiations for the settlement of the Duke's claims.
The correspondence which passed between them forms, therefore, our best source of information
for this period. On Christmas Eve in 1524 Michelangelo writes from Florence to his friend,
begging him not to postpone a journey he had in view, if the only business which detained him
was the trouble about the tomb. A pleasant air of manly affection breathes through this document,
showing Michelangelo to have been unselfish in a matter which weighed heavily and daily on
his spirits. How greatly he was affected can be inferred from a letter written to Giovanni
Spina on the 19th of April 1525. While reading this, it must be remembered that the Duke laid
his action for the recovery of a considerable balance, which he alleged to be due to him upon
disbursements made for the monument. Michelangelo, on the contrary, asserted that he was out
of pocket, as we gather from the lengthy report he forwarded in 1524 to Fattucci. The difficulty
in the accounts seems to have arisen from the fact that payments for the Sistine Chapel and
the tomb had been mixed up. The letter to Spina runs as follows: "There is no reason for sending
a power of attorney about the tomb of Pope Julius, because I do not want to plead. They cannot
bring a suit if I admit that I am in the wrong; so I assume that I have sued and lost, and
have to pay; and this I am disposed to do, if I am able. Therefore, if the Pope will help me
in the matter--and this would be the greatest satisfaction to me, seeing I am too old and ill
to finish the work--he might, as intermediary, express his pleasure that I should repay what
I have received for its performance, so as to release me from this burden, and to enable the
relatives of Pope Julius to carry out the undertaking by any master whom they may choose to
employ. In this way his Holiness could be of very great assistance to me. Of course I desire
to reimburse as little as possible, always consistently with justice. His Holiness might employ
some of my arguments, as, for instance, the time spent for the Pope at Bologna, and other times
wasted without any compensation, according to the statements I have made in full to Ser Giovan
Francesco (Fattucci). Directly the terms of restitution have been settled, I will engage my
property, sell, and put myself in a position to repay the money. I shall then be able to think
of the Pope's orders and to work; as it is, I can hardly be said to live, far less to work.
There is no other way of putting an end to the affair more safe for myself, nor more agreeable,
nor more certain to ease my mind. It can be done amicably without a lawsuit. I pray to God
that the Pope may be willing to accept the mediation, for I cannot see that any one else is
fit to do it."

Giorgio Vasari says that he came in the year 1525 for a short time as pupil to Michelangelo.
In his own biography he gives the date, more correctly, 1524. At any rate, the period of Vasari's
brief apprenticeship was closed by a journey which the master made to Rome, and Buonarroti
placed the lad in Andrea del Sarto's workshop. "He left for Rome in haste. Francesco Maria,
Duke of Urbino, was again molesting him, asserting that he had received 16,000 ducats to complete
the tomb, while he stayed idling at Florence for his own amusement. He threatened that, if
he did not attend to the work, he would make him suffer. So, when he arrived there, Pope Clement,
who wanted to command his services, advised him to reckon with the Duke's agents, believing
that, for what he had already done, he was rather creditor than debtor. The matter remained
thus." We do not know when this journey to Rome took place. From a hint in the letter of December
24, 1524, to Fattucci, where Michelangelo observes that only he in person would be able to
arrange matters, it is possible that we may refer it to the beginning of 1525. Probably he
was able to convince, not only the Pope, but also the Duke's agents that he had acted with
scrupulous honesty, and that his neglect of the tomb was due to circumstances over which he
had no control, and which he regretted as acutely as anybody. There is no shadow of doubt that
this was really the case. Every word written by Michelangelo upon the subject shows that he
was heart-broken at having to abandon the long-cherished project.

Some sort of arrangement must have been arrived at. Clement took the matter into his own hands,
and during the summer of 1525 amicable negotiations were in progress. On the 4th of September
Michelangelo writes again to Fattucci, saying that he is quite willing to complete the tomb
upon the same plan as that of the Pope Pius (now in the Church of S. Andrea della Valle)--that
is, to adopt a mural system instead of the vast detached monument. This would take less time.
He again urges his friend not to stay at Rome for the sake of these affairs. He hears that
the plague is breaking out there. "And I would rather have you alive than my business settled.
If I die before the Pope, I shall not have to settle any troublesome affairs. If I live, I
am sure the Pope will settle them, if not now, at some other time. So come back. I was with
your mother yesterday, and advised her, in the presence of Granacci and John the turner, to
send for you home."

While in Rome Michelangelo conferred with Clement about the sacristy and library at S. Lorenzo.
For a year after his return to Florence he worked steadily at the Medicean monuments, but not
without severe annoyances, as appears from the following to Fattucci: "The four statues I have
in hand are not yet finished, and much has still to be done upon them. The four rivers are
not begun, because the marble is wanting, and yet it is here. I do not think it opportune to
tell you why. With regard to the affairs of Julius, I am well disposed to make the tomb like
that of Pius in S. Peter's, and will do so little by little, now one piece and now another,
and will pay for it out of my own pocket, if I keep my pension and my house, as you promised
me. I mean, of course, the house at Rome, and the marbles and other things I have there. So
that, in fine, I should not have to restore to the heirs of Julius, in order to be quit of
the contract, anything which I have hitherto received; the tomb itself, completed after the
pattern of that of Pius, sufficing for my full discharge. Moreover, I undertake to perform
the work within a reasonable time, and to finish the statues with my own hand." He then turns
to his present troubles at Florence. The pension was in arrears, and busybodies annoyed him
with interferences of all sorts. "If my pension were paid, as was arranged, I would never stop
working for Pope Clement with all the strength I have, small though that be, since I am old.
At the same time I must not be slighted and affronted as I am now, for such treatment weighs
greatly on my spirits. The petty spites I speak of have prevented me from doing what I want
to do these many months; one cannot work at one thing with the hands, another with the brain,
especially in marble. 'Tis said here that these annoyances are meant to spur me on; but I maintain
that those are scurvy spurs which make a good steed jib. I have not touched my pension during
the past year, and struggle with poverty. I am left in solitude to bear my troubles, and have
so many that they occupy me more than does my art; I cannot keep a man to manage my house through
lack of means."

Michelangelo's dejection caused serious anxiety to his friends. Jacopo Salviati, writing on
the 30th October from Rome, endeavoured to restore his courage. "I am greatly distressed to
hear of the fancies you have got into your head. What hurts me most is that they should prevent
your working, for that rejoices your ill-wishers, and confirms them in what they have always
gone on preaching about your habits." He proceeds to tell him how absurd it is to suppose that
Baccio Bandinelli is preferred before him. "I cannot perceive how Baccio could in any way whatever
be compared to you, or his work be set on the same level as your own." The letter winds up
with exhortations to work. "Brush these cobwebs of melancholy away; have confidence in his
Holiness; do not give occasion to your enemies to blaspheme, and be sure that your pension
will be paid; I pledge my word for it." Buonarroti, it is clear, wasted his time, not through
indolence, but through allowing the gloom of a suspicious and downcast temperament--what the
Italians call accidia--to settle on his spirits.

Skipping a year, we find that these troublesome negotiations about the tomb were still pending.
He still hung suspended between the devil and the deep sea, the importunate Duke of Urbino
and the vacillating Pope. Spina, it seems, had been writing with too much heat to Rome, probably
urging Clement to bring the difficulties about the tomb to a conclusion. Michelangelo takes
the correspondence up again with Fattucci on November 6, 1526. What he says at the beginning
of the letter is significant. He knows that the political difficulties in which Clement had
become involved were sufficient to distract his mind, as Julius once said, from any interest
in "stones small or big." Well, the letter starts thus: "I know that Spina wrote in these days
past to Rome very hotly about my affairs with regard to the tomb of Julius. If he blundered,
seeing the times in which we live, I am to blame, for I prayed him urgently to write. It is
possible that the trouble of my soul made me say more than I ought. Information reached me
lately about the affair which alarmed me greatly. It seems that the relatives of Julius are
very ill-disposed towards me. And not without reason.--The suit is going on, and they are demanding
capital and interest to such an amount that a hundred of my sort could not meet the claims.
This has thrown me into terrible agitation, and makes me reflect where I should be if the Pope
failed me. I could not live a moment. It is that which made me send the letter alluded to above.
Now, I do not want anything but what the Pope thinks right. I know that he does not desire
my ruin and my disgrace."

He proceeds to notice that the building work at S. Lorenzo is being carried forward very slowly,
and money spent upon it with increasing parsimony. Still he has his pension and his house;
and these imply no small disbursements. He cannot make out what the Pope's real wishes are.
If he did but know Clement's mind, he would sacrifice everything to please him. "Only if I
could obtain permission to begin something either here or in Rome, for the tomb of Julius,
I should be extremely glad; for, indeed, I desire to free myself from that obligation more
than to live." The letter closes on a note of sadness: "If I am unable to write what you will
understand, do not be surprised, for I have lost my wits entirely."

After this we hear nothing more about the tomb in Michelangelo's correspondence till the year
1531. During the intervening years Italy was convulsed by the sack of Rome, the siege of Florence,
and the French campaigns in Lombardy and Naples. Matters only began to mend when Charles V.
met Clement at Bologna in 1530, and established the affairs of the peninsula upon a basis which
proved durable. That fatal lustre (1526-1530) divided the Italy of the Renaissance from the
Italy of modern times with the abruptness of an Alpine watershed. Yet Michelangelo, aged fifty-one
in 1526, was destined to live on another thirty-eight years, and, after the death of Clement,
to witness the election of five successive Popes. The span of his life was not only extraordinary
in its length, but also in the events it comprehended. Born in the mediaeval pontificate of
Sixtus IV., brought up in the golden days of Lorenzo de' Medici, he survived the Franco-Spanish
struggle for supremacy, watched the progress of the Reformation, and only died when a new Church
and a new Papacy had been established by the Tridentine Council amid states sinking into the
repose of decrepitude.

VI

We must return from this digression and resume the events of Michelangelo's life in 1525.

The first letter to Sebastiano del Piombo is referred to April of that year. He says that a
picture, probably the portrait of Anton Francesco degli Albizzi, is eagerly expected at Florence.
When it arrived in May, he wrote again under the influence of generous admiration for his friend's
performance: "Last evening our friend the Captain Cuio and certain other gentlemen were so
kind as to invite me to sup with them. This gave me exceeding great pleasure, since it drew
me forth a little from my melancholy, or shall we call it my mad mood. Not only did I enjoy
the supper, which was most agreeable, but far more the conversation. Among the topics discussed,
what gave me most delight was to hear your name mentioned by the Captain; nor was this all,
for he still added to my pleasure, nay, to a superlative degree, by saying that, in the art
of painting he held you to be sole and without peer in the whole world, and that so you were
esteemed at Rome. I could not have been better pleased. You see that my judgment is confirmed;
and so you must not deny that you are peerless, when I write it, since I have a crowd of witnesses
to my opinion. There is a picture too of yours here, God be praised, which wins credence for
me with every one who has eyes."

Correspondence was carried on during this year regarding the library at S. Lorenzo; and though
I do not mean to treat at length about that building in this chapter, I cannot omit an autograph
postscript added by Clement to one of his secretary's missives: "Thou knowest that Popes have
no long lives; and we cannot yearn more than we do to behold the chapel with the tombs of our
kinsmen, or at any rate to hear that it is finished. Likewise, as regards the library. Wherefore
we recommend both to thy diligence. Meantime we will betake us (as thou saidst erewhile) to
a wholesome patience, praying God that He may put it into thy heart to push the whole forward
together. Fear not that either work to do or rewards shall fail thee while we live. Farewell,
with the blessing of God and ours.--Julius." [Julius was the Pope's baptismal name.--ED.]

Michelangelo began the library in 1526, as appears from his Ricordi. Still the work went on
slowly, not through his negligence, but, as we have seen, from the Pope's preoccupation with
graver matters. He had a great many workmen in his service at this period, and employed celebrated
masters in their crafts, as Tasso and Carota for wood-carving, Battista del Cinque and Ciapino
for carpentry, upon the various fittings of the library. All these details he is said to have
designed; and it is certain that he was considered responsible for their solidity and handsome
appearance. Sebastiano, for instance, wrote to him about the benches: "Our Lord wishes that
the whole work should be of carved walnut. He does not mind spending three florins more; for
that is a trifle, if they are Cosimesque in style, I mean resemble the work done for the magnificent
Cosimo." Michelangelo could not have been the solitary worker of legend and tradition. The
nature of his present occupations rendered this impossible. For the completion of his architectural
works he needed a band of able coadjutors. Thus in 1526 Giovanni da Udine came from Rome to
decorate the vault of the sacristy with frescoed arabesques. His work was nearly terminated
in 1533, when some question arose about painting the inside of the lantern. Sebastiano, apparently
in good faith, made the following burlesque suggestion: "For myself, I think that the Ganymede
would go there very well; one could put an aureole about him, and turn him into a S. John of
the Apocalypse when he is being caught up into the heavens." The whole of one side of the Italian
Renaissance, its so-called neo-paganism, is contained in this remark.

While still occupied with thoughts about S. Lorenzo, Clement ordered Michelangelo to make a
receptacle for the precious vessels and reliques collected by Lorenzo the Magnificent. It was
first intended to place this chest, in the form of a ciborium, above the high altar, and to
sustain it on four columns. Eventually, the Pope resolved that it should be a sacrarium, or
cabinet for holy things, and that this should stand above the middle entrance door to the church.
The chest was finished, and its contents remained there until the reign of the Grand Duke Pietro
Leopoldo, when they were removed to the chapel next the old sacristy.

Another very singular idea occurred to his Holiness in the autumn of 1525. He made Fattucci
write that he wished to erect a colossal statue on the piazza of S. Lorenzo, opposite the Stufa
Palace. The giant was to surmount the roof of the Medicean Palace, with its face turned in
that direction and its back to the house of Luigi della Stufa. Being so huge, it would have
to be composed of separate pieces fitted together. Michelangelo speedily knocked this absurd
plan on the head in a letter which gives a good conception of his dry and somewhat ponderous
humour.

"About the Colossus of forty cubits, which you tell me is to go or to be placed at the corner
of the loggia in the Medicean garden, opposite the corner of Messer Luigi della Stufa, I have
meditated not a little, as you bade me. In my opinion that is not the proper place for it,
since it would take up too much room on the roadway. I should prefer to put it at the other,
where the barber's shop is. This would be far better in my judgment, since it has the square
in front, and would not encumber the street. There might be some difficulty about pulling down
the shop, because of the rent. So it has occurred to me that the statue might be carved in
a sitting position; the Colossus would be so lofty that if we made it hollow inside, as indeed
is the proper method for a thing which has to be put together from pieces, the shop might be
enclosed within it, and the rent be saved. And inasmuch as the shop has a chimney in its present
state, I thought of placing a cornucopia in the statue's hand, hollowed out for the smoke to
pass through. The head too would be hollow, like all the other members of the figure. This
might be turned to a useful purpose, according to the suggestion made me by a huckster on the
square, who is my good friend. He privily confided to me that it would make an excellent dovecote.
Then another fancy came into my head, which is still better, though the statue would have to
be considerably heightened. That, however, is quite feasible, since towers are built up of
blocks; and then the head might serve as bell-tower to San Lorenzo, which is much in need of
one. Setting up the bells inside, and the sound booming through the mouth, it would seem as
though the Colossus were crying mercy, and mostly upon feast-days, when peals are rung most
often and with bigger bells."

Nothing more is heard of this fantastic project; whence we may conclude that the irony of Michelangelo's
epistle drove it out of the Pope's head.

CHAPTER IX

I

It lies outside the scope of this work to describe the series of events which led up to the
sack of Rome in 1527. Clement, by his tortuous policy, and by the avarice of his administration,
had alienated every friend and exasperated all his foes. The Eternal City was in a state of
chronic discontent and anarchy. The Colonna princes drove the Pope to take refuge in the Castle
of S. Angelo; and when the Lutheran rabble raised by Frundsberg poured into Lombardy, the Duke
of Ferrara assisted them to cross the Po, and the Duke of Urbino made no effort to bar the
passes of the Apennines. Losing one leader after the other, these ruffians, calling themselves
an Imperial army, but being in reality the scum and offscourings of all nations, without any
aim but plunder and ignorant of policy, reached Rome upon the 6th of May. They took the city
by assault, and for nine months Clement, leaning from the battlements of Hadrian's Mausoleum,
watched smoke ascend from desolated palaces and desecrated temples, heard the wailing of women
and the groans of tortured men, mingling with the ribald jests of German drunkards and the
curses of Castilian bandits. Roaming those galleries and gazing from those windows, he is said
to have exclaimed in the words of Job: "Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up
the ghost when I came out of the belly?"

The immediate effect of this disaster was that the Medici lost their hold on Florence. The
Cardinal of Cortona, with the young princes Ippolito and Alessandro de' Medici, fled from the
city on the 17th of May, and a popular government was set up under the presidency of Niccolò
Capponi.

During this year and the next, Michelangelo was at Florence; but we know very little respecting
the incidents of his life. A Ricordo bearing the date April 29 shows the disturbed state of
the town. "I record how, some days ago, Piero di Filippo Gondi asked for permission to enter
the new sacristy at S. Lorenzo, in order to hide there certain goods belonging to his family,
by reason of the perils in which we are now. To-day, upon the 29th of April 1527, he has begun
to carry in some bundles, which he says are linen of his sisters; and I, not wishing to witness
what he does or to know where he hides the gear away, have given him the key of the sacristy
this evening."

There are only two letters belonging to the year 1527. Both refer to a small office which had
been awarded to Michelangelo with the right to dispose of the patronage. He offered it to his
favourite brother, Buonarroto, who does not seem to have thought it worth accepting.

The documents for 1528 are almost as meagre. We do not possess a single letter, and the most
important Ricordi relate to Buonarroto's death and the administration of his property. He died
of the plague upon the 2nd of July, to the very sincere sorrow of his brother. It is said that
Michelangelo held him in his arms while he was dying, without counting the risk to his own
life. Among the minutes of disbursements made for Buonarroto's widow and children after his
burial, we find that their clothes had been destroyed because of the infection. All the cares
of the family now fell on Michelangelo's shoulders. He placed his niece Francesca in a convent
till the time that she should marry, repaid her dowry to the widow Bartolommea, and provided
for the expenses of his nephew Lionardo.

For the rest, there is little to relate which has any bearing on the way in which he passed
his time before the siege of Florence began. One glimpse, however, is afforded of his daily
life and conversation by Benvenuto Cellini, who had settled in Florence after the sack of Rome,
and was working in a shop he opened at the Mercato Nuovo. The episode is sufficiently interesting
to be quoted. A Sienese gentleman had commissioned Cellini to make him a golden medal, to be
worn in the hat. "The subject was to be Hercules wrenching the lion's mouth. While I was working
at this piece, Michel Agnolo Buonarroti came oftentimes to see it. I had spent infinite pains
upon the design, so that the attitude of the figure and the fierce passion of the beast were
executed in quite a different style from that of any craftsman who had hitherto attempted such
groups. This, together with the fact that the special branch of art was totally unknown to
Michel Agnolo, made the divine master give such praises to my work that I felt incredibly inspired
for further effort.

"Just then I met with Federigo Ginori, a young man of very lofty spirit. He had lived some
years in Naples and being endowed with great charms of person and presence, had been the lover
of a Neapolitan princess. He wanted to have a medal made with Atlas bearing the world upon
his shoulders, and applied to Michel Agnolo for a design. Michel Agnolo made this answer: 'Go
and find out a young goldsmith named Benvenuto; he will serve you admirably, and certainly
he does not stand in need of sketches by me. However, to prevent your thinking that I want
to save myself the trouble of so slight a matter, I will gladly sketch you something; but meanwhile
speak to Benvenuto, and let him also make a model; he can then execute the better of the two
designs.' Federigo Ginori came to me and told me what he wanted, adding thereto how Michel
Agnolo had praised me, and how he had suggested I should make a waxen model while he undertook
to supply a sketch. The words of that great man so heartened me, that I set myself to work
at once with eagerness upon the model; and when I had finished it, a painter who was intimate
with Michel Agnolo, called Giuliano Bugiardini, brought me the drawing of Atlas. On the same
occasion I showed Giuliano my little model in wax, which was very different from Michel Agnolo's
drawing; and Federigo, in concert with Bugiardini, agreed that I should work upon my model.
So I took it in hand, and when Michel Agnolo saw it, he praised me to the skies."

The courtesy shown by Michelangelo on this occasion to Cellini may be illustrated by an inedited
letter addressed to him from Vicenza. The writer was Valerio Belli, who describes himself as
a cornelian-cutter. He reminds the sculptor of a promise once made to him in Florence of a
design for an engraved gem. A remarkably fine stone has just come into his hands, and he should
much like to begin to work upon it. These proofs of Buonarroti's liberality to brother artists
are not unimportant, since he was unjustly accused during his lifetime of stinginess and churlishness.

II

At the end of the year 1528 it became clear to the Florentines that they would have to reckon
with Clement VII. As early as August 18, 1527, France and England leagued together, and brought
pressure upon Charles V., in whose name Rome had been sacked. Negotiations were proceeding,
which eventually ended in the peace of Barcelona (June 20, 1529), whereby the Emperor engaged
to sacrifice the Republic to the Pope's vengeance. It was expected that the remnant of the
Prince of Orange's army would be marched up to besiege the town. Under the anxiety caused by
these events, the citizens raised a strong body of militia, enlisted Malatesta Baglioni and
Stefano Colonna as generals, and began to take measures for strengthening the defences. What
may be called the War Office of the Florentine Republic bore the title of Dieci della Guerra,
or the Ten. It was their duty to watch over and provide for all the interests of the commonwealth
in military matters, and now at this juncture serious measures had to be taken for putting
the city in a state of defence. Already in the year 1527, after the expulsion of the Medici,
a subordinate board had been created, to whom very considerable executive and administrative
faculties were delegated. This board, called the Nove della Milizia, or the Nine, were empowered
to enrol all the burghers under arms, and to take charge of the walls, towers, bastions, and
other fortifications. It was also within their competence to cause the destruction of buildings,
and to compensate the evicted proprietors at a valuation which they fixed themselves. In the
spring of 1529 the War Office decided to gain the services of Michelangelo, not only because
he was the most eminent architect of his age in Florence, but also because the Buonarroti family
had always been adherents of the Medicean party, and the Ten judged that his appointment to
a place on the Nove di Milizia would be popular with the democracy. The patent conferring this
office upon him, together with full authority over the work of fortification, was issued on
the 6th of April. Its terms were highly complimentary. "Considering the genius and practical
attainments of Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti, our citizen, and knowing how excellent
he is in architecture, beside his other most singular talents in the liberal arts, by virtue
whereof the common consent of men regards him as unsurpassed by any masters of our times; and,
moreover, being assured that in love and affection toward the country he is the equal of any
other good and loyal burgher; bearing in mind, too, the labour he has undergone and the diligence
he has displayed, gratis and of his free will, in the said work (of fortification) up to this
day; and wishing to employ his industry and energies to the like effect in future; we, of our
motion and initiative, do appoint him to be governor and procurator-general over the construction
and fortification of the city walls, as well as every other sort of defensive operation and
munition for the town of Florence, for one year certain, beginning with the present date; adding
thereto full authority over all persons in respect to the said work of reparation or pertaining
to it." From this preamble it appears that Michelangelo had been already engaged in volunteer
service connected with the defence of Florence. A stipend of one golden florin per diem was
fixed by the same deed; and upon the 22nd of April following a payment of thirty florins was
decreed, for one month's salary, dating from the 6th of April.

If the Government thought to gain popular sympathy by Michelangelo's appointment, they made
the mistake of alienating the aristocracy. It was the weakness of Florence at this momentous
crisis in her fate, to be divided into parties, political, religious, social; whose internal
jealousies deprived her of the strength which comes alone from unity. When Giambattista Busini
wrote that interesting series of letters to Benedetto Varchi from which the latter drew important
materials for his annals of the siege, he noted this fact. "Envy must always be reckoned as
of some account in republics, especially when the nobles form a considerable element, as in
ours: for they were angry, among other matters, to see a Carducci made Gonfalonier, Michelangelo
a member of the Nine, a Cei or a Giugni elected to the Ten."

Michelangelo had scarcely been chosen to control the general scheme for fortifying Florence,
when the Signory began to consider the advisability of strengthening the citadels of Pisa and
Livorno, and erecting lines along the Arno. Their commissary at Pisa wrote urging the necessity
of Buonarroti's presence on the spot. In addition to other pressing needs, the Arno, when in
flood, threatened the ancient fortress of the city. Accordingly we find that Michelangelo went
to Pisa on the 5th of June, and that he stayed there over the 13th, returning to Florence perhaps
upon the 17th of the month. The commissary, who spent several days in conferring with him and
in visiting the banks of the Arno, was perturbed in mind because Michelangelo refused to exchange
the inn where he alighted for an apartment in the official residence. This is very characteristic
of the artist. We shall soon find him, at Ferrara, refusing to quit his hostelry for the Duke's
palace, and, at Venice, hiring a remote lodging on the Giudecca in order to avoid the hospitality
of S. Mark.

An important part of Michelangelo's plan for the fortification of Florence was to erect bastions
covering the hill of S. Miniato. Any one who stands upon the ruined tower of the church there
will see at a glance that S. Miniato is the key to the position for a beleaguering force; and
"if the enemy once obtained possession of the hill, he would become immediately master of the
town." It must, I think, have been at this spot that Buonarroti was working before he received
the appointment of controller-general of the works. Yet he found some difficulty in persuading
the rulers of the state that his plan was the right one. Busini, using information supplied
by Michelangelo himself at Rome in 1549, speaks as follows: "Whatever the reason may have been,
Niccolò Capponi, while he was Gonfalonier, would not allow the hill of S. Miniato to be fortified,
and Michelangelo, who is a man of absolute veracity, tells me that he had great trouble in
convincing the other members of the Government, but that he could never convince Niccolò. However,
he began the work, in the way you know, with those fascines of tow. But Niccolò made him abandon
it, and sent him to another post; and when he was elected to the Nine, they despatched him
twice or thrice outside the city. Each time, on his return, he found the hill neglected, whereupon
he complained, feeling this a blot upon his reputation and an insult to his magistracy. Eventually,
the works went on, until, when the besieging army arrived, they were tenable."

Michelangelo had hitherto acquired no practical acquaintance with the art of fortification.
That the system of defence by bastions was an Italian invention (although Albert Dürer first
reduced it to written theory in his book of 1527, suggesting improvements which led up to Vauban's
method) is a fact acknowledged by military historians. But it does not appear that Michelangelo
did more than carry out defensive operations in the manner familiar to his predecessors. Indeed,
we shall see that some critics found reason to blame him for want of science in the construction
of his outworks. When, therefore, a difference arose between the controller-general of defences
and the Gonfalonier upon this question of strengthening S. Miniato, it was natural that the
War Office should have thought it prudent to send their chief officer to the greatest authority
upon fortification then alive in Italy. This was the Duke of Ferrara. Busini must serve as
our text in the first instance upon this point. "Michelangelo says that, when neither Niccolò
Capponi nor Baldassare Carducci would agree to the outworks at S. Miniato, he convinced all
the leading men except Niccolò of their necessity, showing that Florence could not hold out
a single day without them. Accordingly he began to throw up bastions with fascines of tow;
but the result was far from perfect, as he himself confessed. Upon this, the Ten resolved to
send him to Ferrara to inspect that renowned work of defence. Thither accordingly he went;
nevertheless, he believes that Niccolò did this in order to get him out of the way, and to
prevent the construction of the bastion. In proof thereof he adduces the fact that, upon his
return, he found the whole work interrupted."

Furnished with letters to the Duke, and with special missives from the Signory and the Ten
to their envoy, Galeotto Giugni, Michelangelo left Florence for Ferrara after the 28th of July,
and reached it on the and of August. He refused, as Giugni writes with some regret, to abandon
his inn, but was personally conducted with great honour by the Duke all round the walls and
fortresses of Ferrara. On what day he quitted that city, and whither he went immediately after
his departure, is uncertain. The Ten wrote to Giugni on the 8th of August, saying that his
presence was urgently required at Florence, since the work of fortification was going on apace,
"a multitude of men being employed, and no respect being paid to feast-days and holidays."
It would also seem that, toward the close of the month, he was expected at Arezzo, in order
to survey and make suggestions on the defences of the city.

These points are not insignificant, since we possess a Ricordo by Michelangelo, written upon
an unfinished letter bearing the date "Venice, September 10," which has been taken to imply
that he had been resident in Venice fourteen days--that is, from the 28th of August. None of
his contemporaries or biographers mention a visit to Venice at the end of August 1529. It has,
therefore, been conjectured that he went there after leaving Ferrara, but that his mission
was one of a very secret nature. This seems inconsistent with the impatient desire expressed
by the War Office for his return to Florence after the 8th of August. Allowing for exchange
of letters and rate of travelling, Michelangelo could not have reached home much before the
15th. It is also inconsistent with the fact that he was expected in Arezzo at the beginning
of September. I shall have to return later on to the Ricordo in question, which has an important
bearing on the next and most dramatic episode in his biography.

III

Michelangelo must certainly have been at Florence soon after the middle of September. One of
those strange panics to which he was constitutionally subject, and which impelled him to act
upon a suddenly aroused instinct, came now to interrupt his work at S. Miniato, and sent him
forth into outlawry. It was upon the 21st of September that he fled from Florence, under circumstances
which have given considerable difficulty to his biographers. I am obliged to disentangle the
motives and to set forth the details of this escapade, so far as it is possible for criticism
to connect them into a coherent narrative. With this object in view, I will begin by translating
what Condivi says upon the subject.

"Michelangelo's sagacity with regard to the importance of S. Miniato guaranteed the safety
of the town, and proved a source of great damage to the enemy. Although he had taken care to
secure the position, he still remained at his post there, in case of accidents; and after passing
some six months, rumours began to circulate among the soldiers about expected treason. Buonarroti,
then, noticing these reports, and being also warned by certain officers who were his friends,
approached the Signory, and laid before them what he had heard and seen. He explained the danger
hanging over the city, and told them there was still time to provide against it, if they would.
Instead of receiving thanks for this service, he was abused, and rebuked as being timorous
and too suspicious. The man who made him this answer would have done better had he opened his
ears to good advice; for when the Medici returned he was beheaded, whereas he might have kept
himself alive. When Michelangelo perceived how little his words were worth, and in what certain
peril the city stood, he caused one of the gates to be opened, by the authority which he possessed,
and went forth with two of his comrades, and took the road for Venice."

As usual with Condivi, this paragraph gives a general and yet substantially accurate account
of what really took place. The decisive document, however, which throws light upon Michelangelo's
mind in the transaction, is a letter written by him from Venice to his friend Battista della
Palla on the 25th of September. Palla, who was an agent for Francis I. in works of Italian
art, antiques, and bric-a-brac, had long purposed a journey into France; and Michelangelo,
considering the miserable state of Italian politics, agreed to join him. These explanations
will suffice to make the import of Michelangelo's letter clear.

"Battista, dearest friend, I left Florence, as I think you know, meaning to go to France. When
I reached Venice, I inquired about the road, and they told me I should have to pass through
German territory, and that the journey is both perilous and difficult. Therefore I thought
it well to ask you, at your pleasure, whether you are still inclined to go, and to beg you;
and so I entreat you, let me know, and say where you want me to wait for you, and we will travel
together, I left home without speaking to any of my friends, and in great confusion. You know
that I wanted in any case to go to France, and often asked for leave, but did not get it. Nevertheless
I was quite resolved, and without any sort of fear, to see the end of the war out first. But
on Tuesday morning, September 21, a certain person came out by the gate at S. Niccolò, where
I was attending to the bastions, and whispered in my ear that, if I meant to save my life,
I must not stay at Florence. He accompanied me home, dined there, brought me horses, and never
left my side till he got me outside the city, declaring that this was my salvation. Whether
God or the devil was the man, I do not know.

"Pray answer the questions in this letter as soon as possible, because I am burning with impatience
to set out. If you have changed your mind, and do not care to go, still let me know, so that
I may provide as best I can for my own journey."

What appears manifest from this document is that Michelangelo was decoyed away from Florence
by some one, who, acting on his sensitive nervous temperament, persuaded him that his life
was in danger. Who the man was we do not know, but he must have been a person delegated by
those who had a direct interest in removing Buonarroti from the place. If the controller-general
of the defences already scented treason in the air, and was communicating his suspicions to
the Signory, Malatesta Baglioni, the archtraitor, who afterwards delivered Florence over for
a price to Clement, could not but have wished to frighten him away.

From another of Michelangelo's letters we learn that he carried 3000 ducats in specie with
him on the journey. It is unlikely that he could have disposed so much cash upon his person.
He must have had companions.

Talking with Michelangelo in 1549--that is, twenty years after the event--Busini heard from
his lips this account of the flight. "I asked Michelangelo what was the reason of his departure
from Florence. He spoke as follows: 'I was one of the Nine when the Florentine troops mustered
within our lines under Malatesta Baglioni and Mario Orsini and the other generals: whereupon
the Ten distributed the men along the walls and bastions, assigning to each captain his own
post, with victuals and provisions; and among the rest, they gave eight pieces of artillery
to Malatesta for the defence of part of the bastions at S. Miniato. He did not, however, mount
these guns within the bastions, but below them, and set no guard.' Michelangelo, as architect
and magistrate, having to inspect the lines at S. Miniato, asked Mario Orsini how it was that
Malatesta treated his artillery so carelessly. The latter answered: 'You must know that the
men of his house are all traitors, and in time he too will betray this town.' These words inspired
him with such terror that he was obliged to fly, impelled by dread lest the city should come
to misfortune, and he together with it. Having thus resolved, he found Rinaldo Corsini, to
whom he communicated his thought, and Corsini replied lightly: 'I will go with you.' So they
mounted horse with a sum of money, and road to the Gate of Justice, where the guards would
not let them pass. While waiting there, some one sung out: 'Let him by, for he is of the Nine,
and it is Michelangelo.' So they went forth, three on horseback, he, Rinaldo, and that man
of his who never left him. They came to Castelnuovo (in the Garfagnana), and heard that Tommaso
Soderini and Niccolò Capponi were staying there. Michelangelo refused to go and see them, but
Rinaldo went, and when he came back to Florence, as I shall relate, he reported how Niccolò
had said to him: 'O Rinaldo, I dreamed to-night that Lorenzo Zampalochi had been made Gonfalonier;'
alluding to Lorenzo Giacomini, who had a swollen leg, and had been his adversary in the Ten.
Well, they took the road for Venice; but when they came to Polesella, Rinaldo proposed to push
on to Ferrara and have an interview with Galeotto Giugni. This he did, and Michelangelo awaited
him, for so he promised. Messer Galeotto, who was spirited and sound of heart, wrought so with
Rinaldo that he persuaded him to turn back to Florence. But Michelangelo pursued his journey
to Venice, where he took a house, intending in due season to travel into France."

Varchi follows this report pretty closely, except that he represents Rinaldo Corsini as having
strongly urged him to take flight, "affirming that the city in a few hours, not to say days,
would be in the hands of the Medici." Varchi adds that Antonio Mini rode in company with Michelangelo,
and, according to his account of the matter, the three men came together to Ferrara. There
the Duke offered hospitality to Michelangelo, who refused to exchange his inn for the palace,
but laid all the cash he carried with him at the disposition of his Excellency.

Segni, alluding briefly to this flight of Michelangelo from Florence, says that he arrived
at Castelnuovo with Rinaldo Corsini, and that what they communicated to Niccolò Capponi concerning
the treachery of Malatesta and the state of the city, so affected the ex-Gonfalonier that he
died of a fever after seven days. Nardi, an excellent authority on all that concerns Florence
during the siege, confirms the account that Michelangelo left his post together with Corsini
under a panic; "by common agreement, or through fear of war, as man's fragility is often wont
to do." Vasari, who in his account of this episode seems to have had Varchi's narrative under
his eyes, adds a trifle of information, to the effect that Michelangelo was accompanied upon
his flight, not only by Antonio Mini, but also by his old friend Piloto. It may be worth adding
that while reading in the Archivio Buonarroti, I discovered two letters from a friend named
Piero Paesano addressed to Michelangelo on January 1, 1530, and April 21, 1532, both of which
speak of his having "fled from Florence." The earlier plainly says: "I heard from Santi Quattro
(the Cardinal, probably) that you have left Florence in order to escape from the annoyance
and also from the evil fortune of the war in which the country is engaged." These letters,
which have not been edited, and the first of which is important, since it was sent to Michelangelo
in Florence, help to prove that Michelangelo's friends believed he had run away from Florence.

It was necessary to enter into these particulars, partly in order that the reader may form
his own judgment of the motives which prompted Michelangelo to desert his official post at
Florence, and partly because we have now to consider the Ricordo above mentioned, with the
puzzling date, September 10. This document is a note of expenses incurred during a residence
of fourteen days at Venice. It runs as follows:--

"Honoured Sir. In Venice, this tenth day of September.... Ten ducats to Rinaldo Corsini. Five
ducats to Messer Loredan for the rent of the house. Seventeen lire for the stockings of Antonio
(Mini, perhaps). For two stools, a table to eat on, and a coffer, half a ducat. Eight soldi
for straw. Forty soldi for the hire of the bed. Ten lire to the man (fante) who came from Florence.
Three ducats to Bondino for the journey to Venice with boats. Twenty soldi to Piloto for a
pair of shoes. Fourteen days' board in Venice, twenty lire."

It has been argued from the date of the unfinished letter below which these items are jotted
down, that Michelangelo must have been in Venice early in September, before his flight from
Florence at the end of that month. But whatever weight we may attach to this single date, there
is no corroborative proof that he travelled twice to Venice, and everything in the Ricordo
indicates that it refers to the period of his flight from Florence. The sum paid to Corsini
comes first, because it must have been disbursed when that man broke the journey at Ferrara.
Antonio Mini and Piloto are both mentioned: a house has been engaged, and furnished with Michelangelo's
usual frugality, as though he contemplated a residence of some duration. All this confirms
Busini, Varchi, Segni, Nardi, and Vasari in the general outlines of their reports. I am of
opinion that, unassisted by further evidence, the Ricordo, in spite of its date, will not bear
out Gotti's view that Michelangelo sought Venice on a privy mission at the end of August 1529.
He was not likely to have been employed as ambassador extraordinary; the Signory required his
services at home; and after Ferrara, Venice had little of importance to show the controller-general
of defences in the way of earthworks and bastions.

IV

Varchi says that Michelangelo, when he reached Venice, "wishing to avoid visits and ceremonies,
of which he was the greatest enemy, and in order to live alone, according to his custom, far
away from company, retired quietly to the Giudecca; but the Signory, unable to ignore the advent
of so eminent a man, sent two of their first noblemen to visit him in the name of the Republic,
and to offer kindly all things which either he or any persons of his train might stand in need
of. This public compliment set forth the greatness of his fame as artist, and showed in what
esteem the arts are held by their magnificent and most illustrious lordships." Vasari adds
that the Doge, whom he calls Gritti, gave him commission to design a bridge for the Rialto,
marvellous alike in its construction and its ornament.

Meanwhile the Signory of Florence issued a decree of outlawry against thirteen citizens who
had quitted the territory without leave. It was promulgated on the 30th of September, and threatened
them with extreme penalties if they failed to appear before the 8th of October. On the 7th
of October a second decree was published, confiscating the property of numerous exiles. But
this document does not contain the name of Michelangelo; and by a third decree, dated November
16, it appears that the Government were satisfied with depriving him of his office and stopping
his pay. We gather indeed, from what Condivi and Varchi relate, that they displayed great eagerness
to get him back, and corresponded to this intent with their envoy at Ferrara. Michelangelo's
flight from Florence seemed a matter of sufficient importance to be included in the despatches
of the French ambassador resident at Venice. Lazare de Baïf, knowing his master's desire to
engage the services of the great sculptor, and being probably informed of Buonarroti's own
wish to retire to France, wrote several letters in the month of October, telling Francis that
Michelangelo might be easily persuaded to join his court. We do not know, however, whether
the King acted on this hint.

His friends at home took the precaution of securing his effects, fearing that a decree for
their confiscation might be issued. We possess a schedule of wine, wheat, and furniture found
in his house, and handed over by the servant Caterina to his old friend Francesco Granacci
for safe keeping. They also did their best to persuade Michelangelo that he ought to take measures
for returning under a safe-conduct. Galeotto Giugni wrote upon this subject to the War Office,
under date October 13, from Ferrara. He says that Michelangelo has begged him to intercede
in his favour, and that he is willing to return and lay himself at the feet of their lordships.
In answer to this despatch, news was sent to Giugni on the 20th that the Signory had signed
a safe-conduct for Buonarroti. On the 22nd Granacci paid Sebastiano di Francesco, a stone-cutter,
to whom Michelangelo was much attached, money for his journey to Venice. It appears that this
man set out upon the 23rd, carrying letters from Giovan Battista della Palla, who had now renounced
all intention of retiring to France, and was enthusiastically engaged in, the defence of Florence.
On the return of the Medici, Palla was imprisoned in the castle of Pisa, and paid the penalty
of his patriotism by death. A second letter which he wrote to Michelangelo on this occasion
deserves to be translated, since it proves the high spirit with which the citizens of Florence
were now awaiting the approach of the Prince of Orange and his veteran army. "Yesterday I sent
you a letter, together with ten from other friends, and the safe-conduct granted by the Signory
for the whole month of November and though I feel sure that it will reach you safely, I take
the precaution of enclosing a copy under this cover. I need hardly repeat what I wrote at great
length in my last, nor shall I have recourse to friends for the same purpose. They all of them,
I know, with one voice, without the least disagreement or hesitation, have exhorted you, immediately
upon the receipt of their letters and the safe-conduct, to return home, in order to preserve
your life, your country, your friends, your honour, and your property, and also to enjoy those
times so earnestly desired and hoped for by you. If any one had foretold that I could listen
without the least affright to news of an invading army marching on our walls, this would have
seemed to me impossible. And yet I now assure you that I am not only quite fearless, but also
full of confidence in a glorious victory. For many days past my soul has been filled with such
gladness, that if God, either for our sins or for some other reason, according to the mysteries
of His just judgment, does not permit that army to be broken in our hands, my sorrow will be
the same as when one loses, not a good thing hoped for, but one gained and captured. To such
an extent am I convinced in my fixed imagination of our success, and have put it to my capital
account. I already foresee our militia system, established on a permanent basis, and combined
with that of the territory, carrying our city to the skies. I contemplate a fortification of
Florence, not temporary, as it now is, but with walls and bastions to be built hereafter. The
principal and most difficult step has been already taken; the whole space round the town swept
clean, without regard for churches or for monasteries, in accordance with the public need.
I contemplate in these our fellow-citizens a noble spirit of disdain for all their losses and
the bygone luxuries of villa-life; an admirable unity and fervour for the preservation of liberty;
fear of God alone; confidence in Him and in the justice of our cause; innumerable other good
things, certain to bring again the age of gold, and which I hope sincerely you will enjoy in
company with all of us who are your friends. For all these reasons, I most earnestly entreat
you, from the depth of my heart, to come at once and travel through Lucca, where I will meet
you, and attend you with due form and ceremony until here: such is my intense desire that our
country should not lose you, nor you her. If, after your arrival at Lucca, you should by some
accident fail to find me, and you should not care to come to Florence without my company, write
a word, I beg. I will set out at once, for I feel sure that I shall get permission.... God,
by His goodness, keep you in good health, and bring you back to us safe and happy."

Michelangelo set forth upon his journey soon after the receipt of this letter. He was in Ferrara
on the 9th of November, as appears from a despatch written by Galeotto Giugni, recommending
him to the Government of Florence. Letters patent under the seal of the Duke secured him free
passage through the city of Modena and the province of Garfagnana. In spite of these accommodations,
he seems to have met with difficulties on the way, owing to the disturbed state of the country.
His friend Giovan Battista Palla was waiting for him at Lucca, without information of his movements,
up to the 18th of the month. He had left Florence on the 11th, and spent the week at Pisa and
Lucca, expecting news in vain. Then, "with one foot in the stirrup," as he says, "the license
granted by the Signory" having expired, he sends another missive to Venice, urging Michelangelo
not to delay a day longer. "As I cannot persuade myself that you do not intend to come, I urgently
request you to reflect, if you have not already started, that the property of those who incurred
outlawry with you is being sold, and if you do not arrive within the term conceded by your
safe-conduct--that is, during this month--the same will happen to yourself without the possibility
of any mitigation. If you do come, as I still hope and firmly believe, speak with my honoured
friend Messer Filippo Calandrini here, to whom I have given directions for your attendance
from this town without trouble to yourself. God keep you safe from harm, and grant we see you
shortly in our country, by His aid, victorious."

With this letter, Palla, who was certainly a good friend to the wayward artist, and an amiable
man to boot, disappears out of this history. At some time about the 20th of November, Michelangelo
returned to Florence. We do not know how he finished the journey, and how he was received;
but the sentence of outlawry was commuted, on the 23rd, into exclusion from the Grand Council
for three years. He set to work immediately at S. Miniato, strengthening the bastions, and
turning the church-tower into a station for sharpshooters. Florence by this time had lost all
her territory except a few strong places, Pisa, Livorno, Arezzo, Empoli, Volterra. The Emperor
Charles V. signed her liberties away to Clement by the peace of Barcelona (June 20,1529), and
the Republic was now destined to be the appanage of his illegitimate daughter in marriage with
the bastard Alessandro de' Medici. It only remained for the army of the Prince of Orange to
reduce the city. When Michelangelo arrived, the Imperial troops were leaguered on the heights
above the town. The inevitable end of the unequal struggle could be plainly foreseen by those
who had not Palla's enthusiasm to sustain their faith. In spite of Ferrucci's genius and spirit,
in spite of the good-will of the citizens, Florence was bound to fall. While admitting that
Michelangelo abandoned his post in a moment of panic, we must do him the justice of remembering
that he resumed it when all his darkest prognostications were being slowly but surely realised.
The worst was that his old enemy, Malatesta Baglioni, had now opened a regular system of intrigue
with Clement and the Prince of Orange, terminating in the treasonable cession of the city.
It was not until August 1530 that Florence finally capitulated. Still the months which intervened
between that date and Michelangelo's return from Venice were but a dying close, a slow agony
interrupted by spasms of ineffectual heroism.

In describing the works at S. Miniato, Condivi lays great stress upon Michelangelo's plan for
arming the bell-tower. "The incessant cannonade of the enemy had broken it in many places,
and there was a serious risk that it might come crashing down, to the great injury of the troops
within the bastion. He caused a large number of mattresses well stuffed with wool to be brought,
and lowered these by night from the summit of the tower down to its foundations, protecting
those parts which were exposed to fire. Inasmuch as the cornice projected, the mattresses hung
free in the air, at the distance of six cubits from the wall; so that when the missiles of
the enemy arrived, they did little or no damage, partly owing to the distance they had travelled,
and partly to the resistance offered by this swinging, yielding panoply." An anonymous writer,
quoted by Milanesi, gives a fairly intelligible account of the system adopted by Michelangelo.
"The outer walls of the bastion were composed of unbaked bricks, the clay of which was mingled
with chopped tow. Its thickness he filled in with earth; and," adds this critic, "of all the
buildings which remained, this alone survived the siege." It was objected that, in designing
these bastions, he multiplied the flanking lines and embrasures beyond what was either necessary
or safe. But, observes the anonymous writer, all that his duty as architect demanded was that
he should lay down a plan consistent with the nature of the ground, leaving details to practical
engineers and military men. "If, then, he committed any errors in these matters, it was not
so much his fault as that of the Government, who did not provide him with experienced coadjutors.
But how can mere merchants understand the art of war, which needs as much science as any other
of the arts, nay more, inasmuch as it is obviously more noble and more perilous?" The confidence
now reposed in him is further demonstrated by a license granted on the 22nd of February 1530,
empowering him to ascend the cupola of the Duomo on one special occasion with two companions,
in order to obtain a general survey of the environs of Florence.

Michelangelo, in the midst of these serious duties, could not have had much time to bestow
upon his art. Still there is no reason to doubt Vasari's emphatic statement that he went on
working secretly at the Medicean monuments. To have done so openly while the city was in conflict
to the death with Clement, would have been dangerous; and yet every one who understands the
artist's temperament must feel that a man like Buonarroti was likely to seek rest and distraction
from painful anxieties in the tranquillising labour of the chisel. It is also certain that,
during the last months of the siege, he found leisure to paint a picture of Leda for the Duke
of Ferrara, which will be mentioned in its proper place.

Florence surrendered in the month of August 1530. The terms were drawn up by Don Ferrante Gonzaga,
who commanded the Imperial forces after the death of Filiberto, Prince of Orange, in concert
with the Pope's commissary-general, Baccio Valori. Malatesta Baglioni, albeit he went about
muttering that Florence "was no stable for mules" (alluding to the fact that all the Medici
were bastards), approved of the articles, and showed by his conduct that he had long been plotting
treason. The act of capitulation was completed on the 12th, and accepted unwillingly by the
Signory. Valori, supported by Baglioni's military force, reigned supreme in the city, and prepared
to reinstate the exiled family of princes. It said that Marco Dandolo of Venice, when news
reached the Pregadi of the fall of Florence, exclaimed aloud: "Baglioni has put upon his head
the cap of the biggest traitor upon record."

V

The city was saved from wreckage by a lucky quarrel between the Italian and Spanish troops
in the Imperial camp. But no sooner was Clement aware that Florence lay at his mercy, than
he disregarded the articles of capitulation, and began to act as an autocratic despot. Before
confiding the government to his kinsmen, the Cardinal Ippolito and Alessandro Duke of Penna,
he made Valori institute a series of criminal prosecutions against the patriots. Battista della
Palla and Raffaello Girolami were sent to prison and poisoned. Five citizens were tortured
and decapitated in one day of October. Those who had managed to escape from Florence were sentenced
to exile, outlawry, and confiscation of goods by hundreds. Charles V. had finally to interfere
and put a stop to the fury of the Pope's revenges. How cruel and exasperated the mind of Clement
was, may be gathered from his treatment of Fra Benedetto da Foiano, who sustained the spirit
of the burghers by his fiery preaching during the privations of the siege. Foiano fell into
the clutches of Malatesta Baglioni, who immediately sent him down to Rome. By the Pope's orders
the wretched friar was flung into the worst dungeon in the Castle of S. Angelo, and there slowly
starved to death by gradual diminution of his daily dole of bread and water. Readers of Benvenuto
Cellini's Memoirs will remember the horror with which he speaks of this dungeon and of its
dreadful reminiscences, when it fell to his lot to be imprisoned there.

 On the 26th of the same month Benvenuto della
Volpaia wrote, repeating what the Pope had written in his brief, and adding that his Holiness
desired him to select some workshop more convenient for his health than the cold and cheerless
sacristy.

In spite of Clement's orders that Michelangelo should confine himself strictly to working on
the Medicean monuments, he continued to be solicited with various commissions. Thus the Cardinal
Cybo wrote in December begging him to furnish a design for a tomb which he intended to erect.
Whether Michelangelo consented is not known.

Early in December Sebastiano resumed his communications on the subject of the tomb of Julius,
saying that Michelangelo must not expect to satisfy the Duke without executing the work, in
part at least, himself. "There is no one but yourself that harms you: I mean, your eminent
fame and the greatness of your works. I do not say this to flatter you. Therefore, I am of
opinion that, without some shadow of yourself, we shall never induce those parties to do what
we want. It seems to me that you might easily make designs and models, and afterwards assign
the completion to any master whom you choose. But the shadow of yourself there must be. If
you take the matter in this way, it will be a trifle; you will do nothing, and seem to do all;
but remember that the work must be carried out under your shadow." A series of despatches,
forwarded between December 4, 1531, and April 29, 1532, by Giovan Maria della Porta to the
Duke of Urbino, confirm the particulars furnished by the letters which Sebastiano still continued
to write from Rome. At the end of 1531 Michelangelo expressed his anxiety to visit Rome, now
that the negotiations with the Duke were nearly complete. Sebastiano, hearing this, replies:
"You will effect more in half an hour than I can do in a whole year. I believe that you will
arrange everything after two words with his Holiness; for our Lord is anxious to meet your
wishes." He wanted to be present at the drawing up and signing of the contract. Clement, however,
although he told Sebastiano that he should be glad to see him, hesitated to send the necessary
permission, and it was not until the month of April 1532 that he set out. About the 6th, as
appears from the indorsement of a letter received in his absence, he must have reached Rome.
The new contract was not ready for signature before the 29th, and on that date Michelangelo
left for Florence, having, as he says, been sent off by the Pope in a hurry on the very day
appointed for its execution. In his absence it was duly signed and witnessed before Clement;
the Cardinals Gonzaga and da Monte and the Lady Felice della Rovere attesting, while Giovan
Maria della Porta and Girolamo Staccoli acted for the Duke of Urbino. When Michelangelo returned
and saw the instrument, he found that several clauses prejudicial to his interests had been
inserted by the notary. "I discovered more than 1000 ducats charged unjustly to my debit, also
the house in which I live, and certain other hooks and crooks to ruin me. The Pope would certainly
not have tolerated this knavery, as Fra Sebastiano can bear witness, since he wished me to
complain to Clement and have the notary hanged. I swear I never received the moneys which Giovan
Maria della Porta wrote against me, and caused to be engrossed upon the contract."

It is difficult to understand why Michelangelo should not have immediately taken measures to
rectify these errors. He seems to have been well aware that he was bound to refund 2000 ducats,
since the only letter from his pen belonging to the year 1532 is one dated May, and addressed
to Andrea Quarantesi in Pisa. In this document he consults Quarantesi about the possibility
of raising that sum, with 1000 ducats in addition. "It was in my mind, in order that I might
not be left naked, to sell houses and possessions, and to let the lira go for ten soldi." As
the contract was never carried out, the fraudulent passages inserted in the deed did not prove
of practical importance. Delia Porta, on his part, wrote in high spirits to his master: "Yesterday
we executed the new contract with Michelangelo, for the ratification of which by your Lordship
we have fixed a limit of two months. It is of a nature to satisfy all Rome, and reflects great
credit on your Lordship for the trouble you have taken in concluding it. Michelangelo, who
shows a very proper respect for your Lordship, has promised to make and send you a design.
Among other items, I have bound him to furnish six statues by his own hand, which will be a
world in themselves, because they are sure to be incomparable. The rest he may have finished
by some sculptor at his own choice, provided the work is done under his direction. The Pope
allows him to come twice a year to Rome, for periods of two months each, in order to push the
work forward. And he is to execute the whole at his own costs." He proceeds to say, that since
the tomb cannot be put up in S. Peter's, S. Pietro in Vincoli has been selected as the most
suitable church. It appears that the Duke's ratification was sent upon the 5th of June and
placed in the hands of Clement, so that Michelangelo probably did not see it for some months.
Della Porta, writing to the Duke again upon the 19th of June, says that Clement promised to
allow Michelangelo to come to Rome in the winter, and to reside there working at the tomb.
But we have no direct information concerning his doings after the return to Florence at the
end of April 1532.

It will be worth while to introduce Condivi's account of these transactions relating to the
tomb of Julius, since it throws some light upon the sculptor's private feelings and motives,
as well as upon the falsification of the contract as finally engrossed.

"When Michelangelo had been called to Rome by Pope Clement, he began to be harassed by the
agents of the Duke of Urbino about the sepulchre of Julius. Clement, who wished to employ him
in Florence, did all he could to set him free, and gave him for his attorney in this matter
Messer Tommaso da Prato, who was afterwards datary. Michelangelo, however, knowing the devil
disposition of Duke Alessandro toward him, and being in great dread on this account, also because
he bore love and reverence to the memory of Pope Julius and to the illustrious house of Della
Rovere, strained every nerve to remain in Rome and busy himself about the tomb. What made him
more anxious was that every one accused him of having received from Pope Julius at least 16,000
crowns, and of having spent them on himself without fulfilling his engagements. Being a man
sensitive about his reputation, he could not bear the dishonour of such reports, and wanted
the whole matter to be cleared up; nor, although he was now old, did he shrink from the very
onerous task of completing what he had begun so long ago. Consequently they came to strife
together, and his antagonists were unable to prove payments to anything like the amount which
had first been noised abroad; indeed, on the contrary, more than two thirds of the whole sum
first stipulated by the two Cardinals was wanting. Clement then thinking he had found an excellent
opportunity for setting him at liberty and making use of his whole energies, called Michelangelo
to him, and said: 'Come, now, confess that you want to make this tomb, but wish to know who
will pay you the balance.' Michelangelo, knowing well that the Pope was anxious to employ him
on his own work, answered: 'Supposing some one is found to pay me.' To which Pope Clement:
'You are a great fool if you let yourself believe that any one will come forward to offer you
a farthing.' Accordingly, his attorney, Messer Tommaso, and the agents of the Duke, after some
negotiations, came to an agreement that a tomb should at least be made for the amount he had
received. Michelangelo, thinking the matter had arrived at a good conclusion, consented with
alacrity. He was much influenced by the elder Cardinal di Monte, who owed his advancement to
Julius II., and was uncle of Julius III., our present Pope by grace of God. The arrangement
was as follows: That he should make a tomb of one façade only; should utilise those marbles
which he had already blocked out for the quadrangular monument, adapting them as well as circumstances
allowed; and finally, that he should be bound to furnish six statues by his own hand. In spite
of this arrangement, Pope Clement was allowed to employ Michelangelo in Florence or where he
liked during four months of the year, that being required by his Holiness for his undertakings
at S. Lorenzo. Such then was the contract made between the Duke and Michelangelo. But here
it has to be observed, that after all accounts had been made up, Michelangelo secretly agreed
with the agents of his Excellency that it should be reported that he had received some thousands
of crowns above what had been paid to him; the object being to make his obligation to the Duke
of Urbino seem more considerable, and to discourage Pope Clement from sending him to Florence,
whither he was extremely unwilling to go. This acknowledgment was not only bruited about in
words, but, without his knowledge or consent, was also inserted into the deed; not when this
was drawn up, but when it was engrossed; a falsification which caused Michelangelo the utmost
vexation. The ambassador, however, persuaded him that this would do him no real harm: it did
not signify, he said, whether the contract specified a thousand or twenty thousand crowns,
seeing they were agreed that the tomb should be reduced to suit the sums actually received;
adding, that nobody was concerned in the matter except himself, and that Michelangelo might
feel safe with him on account of the understanding between them.
