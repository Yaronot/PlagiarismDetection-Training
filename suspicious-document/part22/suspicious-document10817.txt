PREFACE.

MY DEAR LADS,

There are few figures in history who have individually exercised so great an influence upon
events as William Wallace and Robert Bruce. It was to the extraordinary personal courage, indomitable
perseverance, and immense energy of these two men that Scotland owed her freedom from English
domination. So surprising were the traditions of these feats performed by these heroes that
it was at one time the fashion to treat them as belonging as purely to legend as the feats
of St. George or King Arthur.  Careful investigation, however, has shown that so far from this
being the case, almost every deed reported to have been performed by them is verified by contemporary
historians. Sir William Wallace had the especial bad fortune of having come down to us principally
by the writings of his bitter enemies, and even modern historians, who should have taken a
fairer view of his life, repeated the cry of the old English writers that he was a bloodthirsty
robber. Mr. W. Burns, however, in his masterly and exhaustive work, The Scottish War of Independence,
has torn these calumnies to shreds, and has displayed Wallace as he was, a high minded and
noble patriot. While consulting other writers, especially those who wrote at the time of or
but shortly after the events they record, I have for the most part followed Burns in all the
historical portions of the narrative. Throughout the story, therefore, wherein it at all relates
to Wallace, Bruce, and the other historical characters, the circumstances and events can be
relied upon as strictly accurate, save only in the earlier events of the career of Wallace,
of which the details that have come down to us are somewhat conflicting, although the main
features are now settled past question.

Yours sincerely,
  G.A. HENTY.

Chapter I

Glen Cairn

The village of Glen Cairn was situated in a valley in the broken country lying to the west
of the Pentland Hills, some fifteen miles north of the town of Lanark, and the country around
it was wild and picturesque.  The villagers for the most part knew little of the world beyond
their own valley, although a few had occasionally paid visits to Glasgow, which lay as far
to the west as Lanark was distant to the south. On a spur jutting out from the side of the
hill stood Glen Cairn Castle, whose master the villagers had for generations regarded as their
lord.

The glory of the little fortalice had now departed. Sir William Forbes had been killed on his
own hearthstone, and the castle had been sacked in a raid by the Kerrs, whose hold lay to the
southwest, and who had long been at feud with the Forbeses. The royal power was feeble, and
the Kerrs had many friends, and were accordingly granted the lands they had seized; only it
was specified that Dame Forbes, the widow of Sir William, should be allowed to reside in the
fortalice free from all let or hindrance, so long as she meddled not, nor sought to stir up
enmity among the late vassals of her lord against their new masters.

The castle, although a small one, was strongly situated.  The spur of the hill ran some 200
yards into the valley, rising sharply some 30 or 40 feet above it. The little river which meandered
down the valley swept completely round the foot of the spur, forming a natural moat to it,
and had in some time past been dammed back, so that, whereas in other parts it ran brightly
over a pebbly bottom, here it was deep and still. The fortalice itself stood at the extremity
of the spur, and a strong wall with a fortified gateway extended across the other end of the
neck, touching the water on both sides.  From the gateway extended two walls inclosing a road
straight to the gateway of the hold itself, and between these walls and the water every level
foot of ground was cultivated; this garden was now the sole remains of the lands of the Forbeses.

It was a narrow patrimony for Archie, the only son of Dame Forbes, and his lady mother had
hard work to keep up a respectable state, and to make ends meet. Sandy Grahame, who had fought
under her husband's banner and was now her sole retainer, made the most of the garden patches. How

"And was he the father of that William Wallace of whom the talk was lately that he had slain
young Selbye, son of the English governor of Dundee?"

"The same, Archie."

"Men say, mother, that although but eighteen years of age he is of great stature and strength,
of very handsome presence, and courteous and gentle; and that he was going quietly through
the streets when insulted by young Selbye, and that he and his companions being set upon by
the English soldiers, slew several and made their escape."

"So they say, Archie. He appears from all description of him to be a remarkable young man,
and I trust that he will escape the vengeance of the English, and that some day he may again
strike some blows for our poor Scotland, which, though nominally under the rule of Baliol,
is now but a province of England."

"But surely, mother, Scotchmen will never remain in such a state of shameful servitude!"

"I trust not, my son; but I fear that it will be long before we shake off the English yoke.
Our nobles are for the most part of Norman blood; very many are barons of England; and so great
are the jealousies among them that no general effort against England will be possible. No,
if Scotland is ever to be freed, it will be by a mighty rising of the common people, and even
then the struggle between the commons of Scotland and the whole force of England aided by the
feudal power of all the great Scotch nobles, would be well nigh hopeless."

This conversation sank deeply into Archie's mind; day and night he thought of nothing but the
lost freedom of Scotland, and vowed that even the hope of regaining his father's lands should
be secondary to that of freeing his country. The speed had applied of defenders who shall have then

The fame of this exploit greatly increased the number of Wallace's followers. So formidable
did the gathering become that convoys by land to Ayr were entirely interrupted, and Earl Percy
held a council of the nobility at Glasgow, and consulted them as to what had best be done.
Finally, Sir Ronald Crawford was summoned and told that unless he induced his nephew to desist
from hostilities they should hold him responsible and waste his lands. Sir Ronald visited the
band in Clydesdale forest, and rather than harm should come upon him, Wallace and his friends
agreed to a truce for two months. Their plunder was stowed away in places of safety, and a
portion of the band being left to guard it the rest dispersed to their homes.

Wallace returned to his uncle's, but was unable long to remain inactive, and taking fifteen
followers he went with them in disguise to Ayr.  Wallace, as usual, was not long before he
got into a quarrel. An English fencing master, armed with sword and buckler, was in an open
place in the city, challenging any one to encounter him. Several Scots tried their fortune
and were defeated, and then seeing Wallace towering above the crowd he challenged him. Wallace
at once accepted, and after guarding himself for some time, with a mighty sweep of his sword
cleft through buckler, arm, headpiece, and skull.  The English soldiers around at once attacked
him; his friends rallied round him, and after hard fighting they made their way to the spot
where they had left their horses and rode to Lag Lane Wood.

When Earl Percy heard that Wallace had been the leader in this fray, and found on inquiry that
he had slain the sword player in fair fight after having been challenged by him, he refused
to regard him as having broken the truce, for he said the soldiers had done wrong in attacking
him. Earl Percy was himself a most gallant soldier, and the extraordinary personal prowess
of Wallace excited in him the warmest admiration, and he would fain, if it had been possible,
have attached him to the service of England.

As soon as the truce was over Wallace again attacked the English. For a time he abode with
the Earl of Lennox, who was one of the few who had refused to take the oath of allegiance,
and having recruited his force, he stormed the stronghold called the Peel of Gargunnock, near
Stirling. Then he entered Perth, leaving his followers in Methven Wood, and hearing that an
English reinforcement was upon the march, formed an ambush, fell upon them, and defeated them;
and pressing hotly upon them entered so close on their heels into Kincleven Castle, that the
garrison had no time to close the gate, and the place was captured. Great stores and booty
were found here; these were carried to the woods, and the castle was burned to the ground,
as that of Gargunnock had been, as Wallace's force was too small to enable him to hold these
strongholds. Indignant at this enterprise so close to their walls the English moved out the
whole garrison, 1000 strong, against Wallace, who had with him but fifty men in all. After
a desperate defence, in which Sir John Butler and Sir William de Loraine, the two officers
in command, were killed by Wallace himself, the latter succeeded in drawing off his men; 120
of the English were killed in the struggle, of whom more than twenty are said to have fallen
at the hands of Wallace alone. Many other similar deeds did Wallace perform; his fame grew
more and more, as did the feeling among the Scotch peasantry that in him they had found their
champion and leader.

Archie eagerly drank in the tale of Wallace's exploits, and his soul was fired by the desire
to follow so valiant a leader. He was now sixteen, his frame was set and vigorous, and exercise
and constant practice with arms had hardened his muscles. He became restless with his life
of inactivity; and his mother, seeing that her quiet and secluded existence was no longer suitable
for him, resolved to send him to her sister's husband, Sir Robert Gordon, who dwelt near Lanark.
Upon the night before he started she had a long talk with him.

"I have long observed, my boy," she said, "the eagerness with which you constantly practise
at arms; and Sandy tells me that he can no longer defend himself against you. Sandy, indeed
is not a young man, but he is still hale and stout, and has lost but little of his strength.
Therefore it seems that, though but a boy, you may be considered to have a man's strength,
for your father regarded Sandy as one of the stoutest and most skilful of his men-at-arms.
I know what is in your thoughts; that you long to follow in your father's footsteps, and to
win back the possessions of which you have been despoiled by the Kerrs. But beware, my boy;
you are yet but young; you have no friends or protectors, save Sir Robert Gordon, who is a
peaceable man, and goes with the times; while the Kerrs are a powerful family, able to put
a strong body in the field, and having many powerful friends and connections throughout the
country. It is our obscurity which has so far saved you, for Sir John Kerr would crush you
without mercy did he dream that you could ever become formidable; and he is surrounded by ruthless
retainers, who would at a word from him take your life; therefore think not for years to come
to match yourself against the Kerrs. You must gain a name and a following and powerful friends
before you move a step in that direction; but I firmly believe that the time will come when
you will become lord of Glencairn and the hills around it. Next, my boy, I see that your thoughts
are ever running upon the state of servitude to which Scotland is reduced, and have marked
how eagerly you listen to the deeds of that gallant young champion, Sir William Wallace. When
the time comes I would hold you back from no enterprise in the cause of our country; but at
present this is hopeless.  Valiant as may be the deeds which Wallace and his band perform,
they are as vain as the strokes of reeds upon armour against the power of England."

"But, mother, his following may swell to an army."

"Even so, Archie; but even as an army it would be but as chaff before the wind against an English
array.  What can a crowd of peasants, however valiant, do against the trained and disciplined
battle of England.  You saw how at Dunbar the Earl of Surrey scattered them like sheep, and
then many of the Scotch nobles were present. So far there is no sign of any of the Scottish
nobles giving aid or countenance to Wallace, and even should he gather an army, fear for the
loss of their estates, a jealousy of this young leader, and the Norman blood in their veins,
will bind them to England, and the Scotch would have to face not only the army of the invader,
but the feudal forces of our own nobles. I say not that enterprises like those of Wallace do
not aid the cause, for they do so greatly by exciting the spirit and enthusiasm of the people
at large, as they have done in your case. My voyagers and instructor, who have been thought until

 If you will accept my friendship, young sir, henceforth we will be brothers in arms."
Colouring with pleasure, Archie grasped the hand which the young knight held out to him.

"That is well said, Sir John," Wallace assented. "Hitherto you and I have been like brothers;
henceforth there will be three of us, and I foresee that the only difficulty we shall have
with this our youngest relation will be to curb his courage and ardour. Who knows," he went
on sadly, "but that save you two I am now alone in the world! My heart misgives me sorely as
to the fate of Marion; and were it not for the sake of Scotland, to whom my life is sworn,
I would that I had stopped and died outside her door before I entered and brought danger upon
her head. Had I had time to reflect, methinks I would have done so; but I heard her call, I
saw the open door, and without time for thought or reflection I leapt in."

"You must not blame yourself, Sir William," Grahame said, "for, indeed, there was no time for
thought; nor will I that it should have been otherwise, even should harm, which I cannot believe,
befall Mistress Marion.  It is on you that the hopes of Scotland now rest. You have awakened
her spirit and taught the lesson of resistance. Soon I hope that the fire now smouldering in
the breast of every true Scotsman will burst into flame, and that Scotland will make a great
effort for freedom; but were you to fall now, despair would seize on all and all hope of a
general rising be at an end."

Wallace made no reply, but strode silently forward. A short distance farther they came to the
spot where three of Wallace's followers were holding horses, for he had on his entry into Lanark,
been accompanied by another of his party, who had been slain at the commencement of the fray.
Wallace bade Archie mount the spare horse, and they then rode to Cart Lane Craigs, scarce a
word being spoken on their journey.

Wallace's headquarters were upon a narrow shelf of rock on the face of a steep and craggy hill.
It was well chosen against surprise, and could be held against sudden attack even by a large
force, since both behind and in front the face of the hill was too steep to be climbed, and
the only approach was by a steep and winding path which two men could hold against a host.
The ledge was some 50 feet long by 12 wide.  At the back a natural depression in the crags
had been deepened so as to form a shallow cave just deep enough to afford a defense against
the weather; here a pile of heather served as a bed for Wallace, Grahame, and one or two others
of the leaders of his company, and here Wallace told Archie that his place was to be. On the
ledge without were some low arbours of heather in which lay ten of Wallace's bravest companions;
the rest of his band were scattered among the surrounding hills, or in the woods, and a bugle
note repeated from place to place would call all together in a short space of time.

Of stores and provisions there was no lack, these having been obtained in very large quantities
from the convoys of supplies and the castles that had been captured. Money, too, was not wanting,
considerable amounts having fallen into their hands, and the peasantry through all the country
round were glad in every way to assist the band, whom they regarded as their champions.

Archie sat down by Sir John Grahame, who gave him particulars regarding the strength of the
various bands, their position, the rules which had been laid down by Wallace for their order,
the system of signals and other particulars; while Wallace paced restlessly up and down the
narrow shelf, a prey to the keenest anxiety. Towards nightfall two of the men were despatched
towards Lanark to endeavour to find out what had taken place there; but in an hour they returned
with a woman, whom both Sir William and Archie recognized as one of the female attendants of
Marion. A single glance sufficed to tell her tale. Her face was swollen with crying, and wore
a look of horror as well as of grief.

"She is dead!" Wallace exclaimed in a low voice.

"Alas!" the woman sobbed, "that I should have to tell it.  Yes, my dear mistress is dead; she
was slain by the orders of the governor himself, for having aided your escape."

A groan burst from Wallace, a cry of horror and indignation from his followers. The former
turned, and without a word strode away and threw himself upon the heather. The others, heart
struck at the cruel blow which had befallen their chief, and burning with indignation and rage,
could only utter oaths of vengeance and curses on the English tyrants.

After a time Grahame went to the cave, and putting his hand on Wallace's shoulder strove to
address a few words of consolation to him.

Sir William rose: "I have done with weeping, Grahame, or rather I will put off my weeping until
I have time for it.  The first thing to think of is vengeance, and vengeance I swear that I
will have. This night I will strike the first blow in earnest towards freeing Scotland. It
may be that God has willed it that this cruel blow, which has been struck at me, shall be the

"Villain!" Wallace exclaimed, seizing him by his throat; "your time has come to make atonement
for the murder of my wife."

Then dragging him into the street he called upon the burghers, who were running up, to witness
the execution of their tyrant, and stepping back a pace smote off his head with his sword.
Young Hazelrig was also killed, as were all soldiers found in the house. The alarm bells were
ringing now, and in a few minutes the armed burghers swarmed in the street. As the English
soldiers, as yet but scarce awake, and bewildered by this sudden attack, hurried from their
houses, they were fallen upon and slain by Wallace and the townspeople. Some of those in the
larger houses issuing forth together were able to cut their way through and to make their escape
by the gates; many made for the walls, and dropping in the moat swam across and escaped; but
two hundred and fifty of their number were left dead in the streets. The town, once cleared
of the English, gave itself up to wild rejoicings; bonfires were lighted in the streets, the
bells were rung, and the wives and daughters of the citizens issued out to join in their rejoicing
and applaud their liberators.

Archie had taken no part in the first battle. Wallace had asked him whether he would fight
by his side or take command of a body of infantry; and he chose the latter alternative. Almost
all the knights and gentlemen were fighting on horse with their followers, and Archie thought
that if these were repulsed the brunt of the fray would fall upon the infantry. On this occasion,
then, he gathered with his band of lads a hundred or so pikemen, and formed them in order,
exhorting them, whatever happened, to keep together and to stand stoutly, even against a charge
of horse. As the victory was won entirely by the cavalry he had no opportunity of distinguishing
himself. Upon the second day, however, he did good service, as he and his lightly armed footmen
were able to cross the bog in places impracticable to the dismounted men-at-arms in their heavy
accoutrements.

The victory of Biggar still further swelled Wallace's forces. Sir William Douglas joined him,
and other gentlemen. A great meeting was held at Forest Kirk, when all the leaders of Wallace's
force were present; and these agreed to acknowledge him as general of the Scottish forces against
England, with the title of Warden of Scotland.

King Edward was at this time busied with his wars in France, and was unable to despatch an
army capable of effecting the reconquest of that portion of Scotland now held by Wallace; and
as the English forces in the various garrisons were insufficient for such purpose, the Earl
of Percy and the other leaders proposed a truce. This was agreed to. Although Wallace was at
the head of a considerable force, Sir William Douglas was the only one among the Scottish nobles
of importance who had joined him; and although the successes which he had gained were considerable,
but little had been really done towards freeing Scotland, all of whose strong places were still
in the hands of the English, and King Edward had not as yet really put out his strength.

The greater portion of the army of Wallace was now dispersed.

Shortly afterwards the governor of Ayr issued a notice that a great council would be held at
that town, and all the Scotch gentlemen of importance in the district were desired to attend.
Wallace was one of those invited; and deeming that the governor might have some proposition
of Edward to lay before them, he agreed to do so. Although a truce had been arranged, he himself
with a band of his most devoted followers still remained under arms in the forest, strictly
keeping the truce, but holding communications with his friends throughout the country, urging
them to make every preparation, by collecting arms and exercising their vassals, to take the
field with a better appointed force at the conclusion of the truce. Provisions and money were
in abundance, so large had been the captures effected; but Wallace was so accustomed to the
free life of the woods that he preferred to remain there to taking up his abode in a town.
Moreover, here he was safe from treachery; for he felt sure that although the English nobles
and leaders would be incapable of breaking a truce, yet that there were many of lower degree
who would not hesitate at any deed of treachery by which they might gain reward and credit
from their king. Archie's band were found of the greatest service as messengers; and although
he sometimes spent a few days at Sir Robert Gordon's with his mother, he generally remained
by the side of Wallace. The spot where the Scottish leader was now staying lay about halfway
between Lanark and Ayr.

Archie heard with uneasiness the news of the approaching council, and Wallace's acceptance
of the invitation. The fact that the Earl of Percy, a very noble knight and gentleman, had
been but lately recalled from the governorship of Ayr and had been replaced by one of somewhat
low degree, Arlouf of Southampton, still further increased his doubts. It seemed strange that
the governorship of so important a town--a post deemed fitting for Earl Percy--should be bestowed
on such a man, were it not that one was desired who would not hesitate to perform an action
from which any honourable English gentleman would shrink.

Two days before the day fixed for the council he called Cluny Campbell and another lad named
Jock Farrel to him.

"I have a most important mission for you," he said. "You have heard of the coming council at
Ayr. I wish to find out if any evil is intended by the governor. For this purpose you two will
proceed thither. You Cluny will put on the garments which you brought with you; while you Jock
had best go as his brother. Here is money. On your way procure baskets and buy chickens and
eggs, and take them in with you to sell.  Go hither and thither among the soldiers and hear
what they say. Gather whether among the townspeople there is any thought that foul play may
be intended by the English. Two of the band will accompany you to within a mile of Ayr, and
will remain there in order that you may from time to time send news by them of aught that you
have gathered. Remember that the safety of Wallace, and with it the future of Scotland, may
depend upon your care and vigilance. I would myself have undertaken the task; but the Kerrs
are now, I hear, in Ayr, and a chance meeting might ruin all; for whatever the truce between
English and Scotch, they would assuredly keep no truce with me did they meet me. Mind, it is
a great honour that I have done you in choosing you, and is a proof that I regard you as two
of the shrewdest of my band, although the youngest among them."

Greatly impressed with the importance of their mission, the lads promised to use their utmost
vigilance to discover the intentions of the governor; and a few minutes later, Cluny being
attired in his sister's clothes, and looking, as Archie laughingly said, "a better looking
girl than she was herself," they started for Ayr, accompanied by two of their companions. They
were to remain there until the conclusion of the council, but their companions would be relieved
every six hours. Upon their way they procured two baskets, which they filled with eggs and
chickens; and then, leaving their comrades a mile outside Ayr, fearlessly entered the town.

The council was to take place in a large wooden building some short distance outside the town,
which was principally chosen because it was thought by the governor that the Scotch gentlemen
would have less reluctance to meet him there than if they were asked to enter a city with a
strong garrison of English.

The first day the lads succeeded in finding out nothing which could give any countenance to
suspicion that treachery was intended. They had agreed to work separately, and each mingled
among the groups of citizens and soldiers, where the council was the general topic of conversation.
There was much wonder and speculation as to the object for which the governor had summoned
it, and as to the terms which he might be expected to propound, but to none did the idea of
treachery or foul play in any way occur; and when at night they left the town and sent off
their message to Archie, the lads could only say that all seemed fair and honest, and that
none either of the townspeople or soldiers appeared to have the least expectation of trouble
arising at the council.  The following morning they agreed that Jock should hang round the
building in which the council was to be held, and where preparations for the meeting and for
a banquet which was afterwards to take place were being made, while Cluny should continue his
inquiries within the walls. Jock hid away his basket and joined those looking on at the preparations.
Green boughs were being carried in for decorating the walls, tables, and benches for the banquet.
These were brought from the town in country carts, and a party of soldiers under the command
of an officer carried them in and arranged them. Several of the rustics looking on gave their
aid in carrying in the tables, in order that they might take home to their wives an account
of the appearance of the place where the grand council was to be held. Jock thrust himself
forward, and seizing a bundle of green boughs, entered the barn. Certainly there was nothing

Field was first arranged and brought into use, through efforts over reformers in Deutschland
and soon of Luther, who was shortly, aviation. He print the hymns which especially of psalm. The

Zwingle, the, Calvin, Knox were very zealous part-singing; and century,
Tallis, Bird, Gibbons did these music.

Before Puritans proved themselves zealous. Castle. They had the castle. Organs, choir-books, spouse-singers

Sir John Grahame instantly gave orders to all those who had horses, to mount and follow him
at the top of their speed; and he himself, with the other gentlemen whose horses were prepared,
started at once at full gallop.

"Sir Archie, do you cause the `assembly' to be sounded, and send off your runners in all directions
to bid every man who can be collected to gather here this afternoon at three o clock. If foul
play has been done we can avenge, although we are too late to save, and, by Heavens, a full
and bloody revenge will I take."

It was not until two in the afternoon that Sir John Grahame returned.

"The worst has happened; I can read it in your face," Wallace exclaimed.

"It is but too true," Sir John replied. "For a time we could obtain no information. One of
my men rode forward until close to the Barns, and reported that all seemed quiet there. A guard
of soldiers were standing round the gates, and he saw one of those invited, who had arrived
a minute before him, dismount and enter quietly. Fortunately I was in time to stop many gentlemen
who were proceeding to the council, but more had entered before I reached there. From time
to time I sent forward men on foot who talked with those who were standing without to watch
the arrivals. Presently a terrible rumour began to spread among them--whether the truth was
known from some coarse jest by one of the soldiers, or how it came out, I know not. But as
time went on, and the hour was long past when any fresh arrivals could be expected, there was
no longer motive for secrecy, and the truth was openly told. Each man as he entered was stopped
just inside the door. A noose was dropped over his neck, and he was hauled up to a hook over
the door. All who entered are dead."

A cry of indignation and rage broke from Wallace and those standing round him, and the Scottish
leader again repeated his oath to take a bloody vengeance for the deed.

"And who are among the murdered?" he asked, after a pause.

"Alas! Sir William," Grahame said, "your good uncle, Sir Ronald Crawford, the Sheriff of Ayr,
is one; and also Sir Richard Wallace of Riccartoun; Sir Bryce Blair, and Sir Neil Montgomery,
Boyd, Barclay, Steuart, Kennedy, and many others."

Wallace was overwhelmed with grief at the news that both his uncles, to whom he was greatly
attached, had perished. Most of those around had also lost relatives and friends, and none
could contain their grief and indignation.

"Was my uncle, Sir Robert Gordon, among the victims?" Archie inquired.

"No," Sir John replied; "happily he was one of the last who came along the road."

"Thank God for that!" Archie said earnestly; "my uncle's slowness has saved his life. He was
ever late for business or pleasure, and my aunt was always rating him for his unpunctuality.
She will not do so again, for assuredly it has saved his life."

The men came in but slowly, for the bands had all dispersed to their homes, and it was only
those who lived within a few miles who could arrive in time. Little over fifty men had come
in by the hour named. With these Wallace started at once towards Ayr. Archie's band fell in
with their arms, for they too burned to revenge the massacre, and Wallace did not refuse Archie's
request that they might join.

"Let them come," he said; "we shall want every sword and pike tonight."

This was the first time that Wallace had seen the band under arms, for at the battle of Biggar,
Archie had kept them from his sight, fearing that he might order them from the field.

"They look well, Sir Archie, and in good military order.  Hitherto I have regarded them but
as messengers, and as such they have done good service indeed; but I see now that you have
them in good order, and that they can do other service on a pinch."

One member of Wallace's band was left behind, with orders to wait until seven o'clock, and
then to bring on as fast as they could march all who might arrive before that hour. The band
marched to within a mile of the barns. They then halted at a stack of straw, and sat down while
one of Archie's band went forward to see what was being done. He reported that a great feast,
at which the governor and all the officers of the garrison, with other English dwelling in
town, were present, was just beginning in the great barn where the massacre had taken place.

Soon after nine o'clock the man who had been left behind, with ten others, who had come in
after Wallace had marched, came up. Each man, by Wallace's directions, drew a great truss of
straw from the stack, and then the party, now eighty in all, marched toward the barn. The is done

 Several arrows struck
him, but he was sheathed in mail, as were his men-at-arms, and although several were wounded
in the face and two slain they succeeded in reaching the bushes, but they could not penetrate
further, for as they strove to tear the bushes aside and force an entry, those behind pierced
them with their spears, and as but four or five assailants at a time could gain a footing and
use their arms they were outnumbered and finally driven back by the defenders. When Sir John,
furious at his discomfiture, rejoined his vassals below, he found that the assault had already
cost him eight of his best men. He would, however, have again led them to the attack, but Red
Roy said:

"It were best, my lord, to send back and bid fifty of the vassals to come up hither at once,
with bows and arrows.  They can so riddle those bushes that the defenders will be unable to
occupy them to resist our advance."

"That were a good step," Sir John said; "but even when we gain the ledge I know not how we
shall force our way through the hole, which you say is but three feet high."

"There is no need to force our way in," Red Roy replied; "each man who climbs shall carry with
him a faggot of wood, and we will smoke them in their holes like wolves."

"`Tis well thought of, Roy; that assuredly is the best plan.  Send off at once one of the most
fleet footed of the party."

Archie, watching from above, saw the assailants draw back out of bowshot, and while one of
their number started at full speed down the hillside, the others sat down, evidently prepared
to pass some time before they renewed the attack.  Leaving two of the party on guard, Archie,
with the rest, re-entered the cavern.  The searchers had just returned and reported that all
the various passages came to nothing, save one, which ascended rapidly and terminated in a
hole which looked as if it had been made by rabbits, and through which the light of day could
be seen.

"Then it is there we must work," Archie said. "I will myself go and examine it."

The passage, after ascending to a point which Archie judged to be nigh a hundred feet above
the floor of the cave, narrowed to a mere hole, but two feet high and as much wide. Up this
he crawled for a distance of four or five yards, then it narrowed suddenly to a hole three
or four inches in diameter, and through this, some three feet farther, Archie could see the
daylight through a clump of heather. He backed himself down the narrow passage again until
he joined his comrades. "Now," he said, "do four of you stay here, and take it by turns, one
after the other, to enlarge the hole forward to the entrance. As you scrape the earth down
you must past it back handful by handful. Do not enlarge the outer entrance or disturb the
roots of the heather growing there. Any movement might be noticed by those below. It is lucky,
indeed, that the rock ends just when it gets to its narrowest, and that it is but sandy soil
through which we have to scrape our way.  It will be hard work, for you have scarce room to
move your arms, but you have plenty of time since we cannot sally out till nightfall."

The hours passed slowly, and about noon the lookout reported that a number of bowmen were approaching.

"They are going to attack this time under cover of their fire," Archie said, "and as I do not
wish to hazard the loss of any lives, we will keep within the cave and let them gain the ledge.
They can never force their way through the narrow entrance. The only thing I fear is smoke.
I purpose that if they light a fire at the mouth of the cave, we shall retire at once up the
passage where we are working, and block it up at a narrow place a short distance after it leaves
this cavern, with our clothes. You had best take off some of your things, scrape up the earth
from the floor of the cavern, and each make a stout bundle, so that we can fill up the hole
solidly."

This was soon done, and the bundles of earth were laid in readiness at the point upon which
their leader had fixed.  In the meantime Archie had rejoined the lookout.

"They have been scattered for some time," the guard said, "and have been cutting down bushes
and making them into faggots."

"Just what I expected," Archie exclaimed. "The bowmen are joining them now. We shall soon see
them at work."

Sir John Kerr now marshalled his retainers. He and his men-at-arms drew their swords, and the
rest, putting the bundles of faggots on their shoulders, prepared to follow, while the bowmen
fitted their arrows to the string.

"Fall back inside the cave," Archie said; "it is of no use risking our lives."

The band now gathered in a half circle, with level spears, round the entrance. Soon they heard
a sharp tapping sound as the arrows struck upon the rock, then there was a crashing among the
bushes.

"Come on!" Sir John Kerr shouted to the vassals. "The foxes have slunk into their hole." Then
came low thuds as the faggots were cast down. The light which had streamed in through the entrance
gradually became obscure, and the voices of those without muffled. The darkness grew more intense
as the faggots were piled thicker and thicker; then suddenly a slight odour of smoke was perceived.

"Come along now," Archie said; "they have fired the pile, and there is no fear of their entrance."

Two of their number, with blazing pine knots, led the way. When they reached the narrow spot
all passed through, Archie and Andrew Macpherson last; these took the bundles of earth, as
the others passed them along from behind, and built them up like a wall across the entrance,
beating them down as they piled them, so as to make them set close and fill up every crevice.
Several remained over after the wall was completed; these were opened and the earth crammed
into the crevices between the bags. The smell of smoke had grown strong before the wall was
completed, but it was not too oppressive to breathe. Holding the torch close to the wall, Archie
and his comrade stopped closely the few places through which they saw that the smoke was making
its way, and soon had the satisfaction of seeing that the barrier was completely smoke tight.

There was plenty of air in the passage to support life for some time, but Archie called back
to those who were labouring to enlarge the exit, in order to allow as much fresh air as possible
to enter. A strong guard, with spears, was placed at the barrier, although Archie deemed that
some hours at least would elapse before the Kerrs could attempt to penetrate the cave. The
fire would doubtless be kept up for some time, and after it had expired it would be long before
the smoke cleared out sufficiently from the cave to allow of any one entering it. After a time,
finding that there was no difficulty in breathing, although the air was certainly close and
heavy, Archie again set the lads at work widening the entrance, going up himself to superintend
the operation.  Each in turn crept forward, loosened a portion of the earth with his knife,
and then filling his cap with it, crawled backward to the point where the passage widened.
It was not yet dark when the work was so far done that there now remained only a slight thickness
of earth, through which the roots of the heath protruded, at the mouth of the passage, and
a vigorous push would make an exit into the air.  The guard at the barrier had heard no movement
within.  Archie withdrew one of the bags; but the smoke streamed through so densely that he
hastily replaced it, satisfied that some hours must still elapse before the assailants would
enter the cave. They watched impatiently the failing light through the hole, and at last, when
night was completely fallen, Archie pushed aside the earth and heather, and looked around.
They were, it seemed to him, on the side of the hill a few yards from the point where it fell
steeply away. The ground was thickly covered with heather. He soon made his way out and ordered
Andrew Macpherson, who followed him, to remain lying at the entrance, and to enjoin each, as
he passed out, to crawl low among the heather, so that they might not show against the skyline,
where, dark as it was, they might attract the attention of those below. Archie himself led
the way until so far back from the edge as to be well out of sight of those in the valley.
Then he gained his feet, and was soon joined by the whole of his band.

"Now," he said, "we will make for Aberfilly; they think us all cooped up here, and will be
rejoicing in our supposed deaths. We will strike one more blow, and then, driving before us
a couple of score of oxen for the use of the army, rejoin Wallace. Methinks we shall have taken
a fair vengeance for Kerr's doings at Glen Cairn."

The consternation of the few men left in the castle was great when, three hours after sunset,
eight homesteads burst suddenly into flames. They dared not sally out, and remained under arms
until morning, when Sir John and his band returned more furious than ever, as they had penetrated
the cavern, discovered the barrier which had cut off the smoke, and the hole by which the foe
had escaped; and their fury was brought to a climax when they found the damage which had been
inflicted in their absence. Many a week passed before the garrison of Aberfilly and the vassals
of the Kerrs were able to sleep in peace, so great was the scare which Archie's raid had inflicted
upon them.

The truce was now at an end. The indignation excited by the treachery of the English spread
widely through Scotland, and the people flocked to Wallace's standard in far greater numbers
than before, and he was now able to undertake operations on a greater scale. Perth, Aberdeen,
Brechin, and other towns fell into his hands, and the castle of Dundee was invested. In the
south Sir William Douglas captured the castles of Sanquhar, Desdeir, and others, and the rapid
successes of the Scots induced a few of the greater nobles to take the field, such as the Steward
of Scotland, Sir Andrew Moray of Bothwell, Sir Richard Lundin, and Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.

Wallace was one day lamenting to Archie and his friend Grahame that the greater nobles still
held aloof.  "Above all," he said, "I would fain see on our side either Comyn or the young
Bruce. Baliol is a captive in London, and it is to Comyn or Bruce that Scotland must look for
her king. So long as only I, a poor knight, am at the head of this rising, it is but a rebellion
against Edward, and its chances are still so weak that but few men, who have aught to lose,
join us; but if Bruce or Comyn should raise his banner all would receive him as our future
king. Both are lords of wide territories, and besides the forces they could bring into the
field, they would be joined by many of the principal nobles, although it is true that the adherents
of the other would probably arm for Edward. Still the thought of a king of their own would
inflame the popular mind, and vast numbers who now hesitate to join a movement supported by
so little authority, would then take up arms."

"Which of the two would you rather?" Archie asked.

"I would rather the Bruce," Wallace said. "His father is an inert man and a mere cypher, and
the death of his grandfather, the competitor, has now brought him prominently forward. It is
true that he is said to be a strong adherent of England and a personal favourite of Edward;
that he spends much of his time in London; and is even at the present moment the king's lieutenant
in Carrick and Annandale, and is waging war for him against Sir William Douglas. Still Comyn
is equally devoted to England; he is older, and less can be hoped from him. Bruce is young;
he is said to be of great strength and skill in arms, and to be one of the foremost knights
in Edward's court. He is, I hear, of noble presence, and is much loved by those with whom he
comes in contact.  Did such a man determine to break with Edward, and to strive to win the
crown of Scotland as a free gift of her people, instead of as a nominee of Edward, and to rule
over an independent kingdom instead of an English province, he would attract all hearts to
him, and may well succeed where I, as I foresee, must sooner or later fail."

"But why should you fail when you have succeeded so far?" Archie asked.

"Because I have with me but a small portion of the people of Scotland. The whole of the northern
lords hold aloof, and in the south Carrick and Annandale and Galloway are hostile. Against
me I have all the power of England, Wales, and Ireland; and although I may for a time win victories
and capture towns I am certain, Archie, in the end to be crushed."

"And will all our efforts have been in vain?" Archie said, with tears in his eyes.

"By no means, my brave lad; we shall have lighted the fire of a national resistance; we shall
have shown the people that if Scotland, divided against herself, and with all her great nobles
and their vassals standing sullenly aloof, can yet for a long time make head against the English,
assuredly when the time shall come, and she shall rise as one man from the Solway to Caithness,
her freedom will be won. Our lives will not have been thrown away, Archie, if they have taught
this lesson."

Wallace had by this time returned from his expedition farther north, and his force was in camp
near Lanark, which town, when not engaged in distant enterprises, was regarded as the centre
of the movement. That evening Archie said, that as his leader purposed to give his troops rest
for a week or two, he should go to his uncle's for a short time.

"And if you can spare them, Sir William, I would fain let my band go away for the same time.
They have now been six months from home."

"Certainly," Wallace said, "they need a rest after their hard work. They are ever afoot, and
have been of immense service."

Having obtained this permission, Archie went to the spot where his band were encamped. "I have
another expedition for you," he said, "this time all together; when that is over you will be
able to go home for a few days for a rest. They will all be glad to see you, and may well be
proud of you, and I doubt not that the spoil which you gathered at Ayr and elsewhere will create
quite a sensation at Glen Cairn. There are some of you who are, as I remember in the old days,
good shots with the bow and arrow. Do ten of you who were the best at home get bows and arrows
from the store. Here is an order for you to receive them, and be all in readiness to march
at daylight."

The next morning the band set out in a southwesterly direction, and after a long day's march
halted near Cumnock.  In the morning they started at the same time, observing more caution
as they went, for by the afternoon they had crossed the stream and were within the boundaries
of Carrick. They halted for the night near Crossraguel Abbey. Here for the first time Archie
confided to his followers the object of their march.

"We are now," he said, "within a few miles of Turnberry Castle, the residence of Bruce. Sir
William has a great desire to speak with him; but, seeing that Bruce is at present fighting
for King Edward against Douglas, there is little chance of such a meeting coming about with

 Archie rose at once, and turned down at a side street
before they came up, as a recognition of him would be fatal to all their plans. When they had
passed up the street to the castle he returned and resumed his seat, feeling more uneasy than
before, for the Kerrs had seen Wallace in the affray at Lanark, and a chance meeting now would
betray him. An hour and a half passed, and then Archie saw the Kerrs riding down the street
from the castle. Again he withdrew from sight, this time down an archway, whence he could still
see the door on the opposite side. Hitherto he had been wishing to see it open and for Wallace
to appear; and now he dreaded this above all things.  His worst fears were realized, for just
as the horsemen reached the spot the door opened, and Wallace stepped out. His figure was too
remarkable to avoid notice; and no sooner did Sir John Kerr's eye fall upon him than he exclaimed,
"The traitor Wallace! Seize him, men; there is a high reward offered for him; and King Edward
will give honour and wealth to all who capture him."

an expectation to proceed he by train to Colenso, with which the object

had called together many soldiers who were wandering in the streets; and these, informed by
Sir John's shouts of "Down with Wallace! Slay! Slay!" that the dreaded Scotch leader was before
them, also drew and joined in the fight.  As they came running up from both sides, Wallace
and Archie could retreat no further, but with their backs against the wall kept their foes
at bay in a semicircle by the sweep of their swords.

The fight continued by two or three minutes, when a sudden shout was heard, and William Orr,
with eight young fellows, fell upon the English soldiers with their pikes. The latter, astonished
at this sudden onslaught, and several of their number being killed before they had time to
turn and defend themselves, fell back for a moment, and Wallace and Archie joined their allies,
and began to retreat, forming a line of pikes across the narrow street. Wallace, Archie, William
Orr, and three of the stoutest of the band were sufficient for the line, and the other five
shot between them. So hard and fast flew their arrows that several of the English soldiers
were slain, and the others drew back from the assault.

Andrew Macpherson's sudden attack at the gate overpowered the guard, and for a while he held
possession of it, and following Archie's instructions, slew a horse drawing a cart laden with
flour in the act of entering.  Then the guard rallied, and, joined by other soldiers who had
run up, made a fierce attack upon him; but his line of pikes drawn up across the gate defied
their efforts to break through. Wallace and his party were within fifty yards of the gate when
reinforcements from the castle arrived. Sir John Kerr, furious at the prospect of his enemies
again escaping him, headed them in their furious rush. And have determined of vassals which will look

Edwards. Even had to be to Roy.
 Its warlike barons, when not engaged under its monarchs in
wars in Wales, Ireland, and France, occupied themselves in quarrels with each other, or in
struggles against the royal supremacy; and although the higher nobles, with their mailclad
followers, could show an amount of chivalrous pomp unknown in Scotland, yet the condition of
the middle classes and of the agricultural population was higher in Scotland than in England.

Archie, as one of the principal leaders of the victorious army, received a share of the treasure
captured in the camp sufficient to repay the money which he had had for the strengthening of
the Castle of Aberfilly, and on the day following the battle he received permission from Sir
William to return at once, with the 250 retainers which he had brought into the field, to complete
the rebuilding of the castle. In another three months this was completed, and stores of arms
and munition of all kinds collected.

Immediately after the defeat at Stirling Bridge, King Edward summoned the Scottish nobles to
join Brian Fitzallan, whom he appointed governor of Scotland, with their whole forces, for
the purpose of putting down the rebellion. Among those addressed as his allies were the Earls
Comyn of Badenoch, Comyn of Buchan, Patrick of Dunbar, Umfraville of Angus, Alexander of Menteith,
Malise of Strathearn, Malcolm of Lennox, and William of Sutherland, together with James the
Steward, Nicholas de la Haye, Ingelram de Umfraville, Richard Fraser, and Alexander de Lindsay
of Crawford. From this enumeration it is clear that Wallace had still many enemies to contend
with at home as well as the force of England. Patrick of Dunbar, assisted by Robert Bruce and
Bishop Anthony Beck, took the field, but was defeated.  Wallace captured all the castles of
the earl save Dunbar itself, and forced him to fly to England; then the Scotch army poured
across the Border and retaliated upon the northern counties for the deeds which the English
had been performing in Scotland for the last eight years. The country was ravaged to the very
walls of Durham and Carlisle, and only those districts which bought off the invaders were spared.
The title which had been bestowed upon Wallace by a comparatively small number was now ratified
by the commonalty of the whole of Scotland; and associated with him was the young Sir Andrew
Moray of Bothwell, whose father had been the only Scotch noble who had fought at Stirling,
and it is notable that in some of the documents of the time Wallace gives precedence to Andrew
Moray.

They proceeded to effect a military organization of the country, dividing it up into districts,
each with commanders and lieutenants. Order was established and negotiations entered into for
the mutual safeguard of traders with the Hanse towns.

The nobles who ventured to oppose the authority of Wallace and his colleague were punished
in some cases by the confiscation of lands, which were bestowed upon Sir Alexander Scrymgeour
and other loyal gentlemen, and these grants were recognized by Bruce when he became king. In
these deeds of grant Wallace and Moray, although acting as governors of Scotland, state that
they do so in the name of Baliol as king, although a helpless captive in England. For a short
time Scotland enjoyed peace, save that Earl Percy responded to the raids made by the Scots
across the Border, by carrying fire and sword through Annandale; and the English writers who
complain of the conduct of the Scots, have no word of reprobation for the proclamation issued
to the soldiers on crossing the Border, that they were free to plunder where they chose, nor
as to the men and women slain, nor the villages and churches committed to the flames.

Chapter X

The Battle of Falkirk

While Wallace was endeavouring to restore order in Scotland, Edward was straining every nerve
to renew his invasion. He himself was upon the Continent, but he made various concessions to
his barons and great towns to induce them to aid him heartily, and issued writs calling upon
the whole nobility remaining at home, as they valued his honour and that of England, to meet
at York on January 20th, "and proceed under the Earl of Surrey to repress and chastise the
audacity of the Scots." At the same time he despatched special letters to those of the Scottish
nobles who were not already in England, commanding them to attend at the rendezvous.

The call upon the Scotch nobles was not generally responded to. They had lost much of their
power over their vassals, many of whom had fought under Wallace in spite of the abstention
of their lords. It was clear, too, that if they joined the English, and another defeat of the
latter took place, their countrymen might no longer condone their treachery, but their titles
and estates might be confiscated. Consequently but few of them presented themselves at York.
There, however, the English nobles gathered in force. The Earls of Surrey, Gloucester, and
Arundel; the Earl Mareschal and the great Constable were there; Guido, son of the Earl of Warwick,
represented his father. Percy was there, John de Wathe, John de Seagrave, and very many other
barons, the great array consisting of 2000 horsemen heavily armed, 1200 light horsemen, and
100,000 foot soldiers.

Sir Aymer de Vallance, Earl of Pembroke, and Sir John Sieward, son of the Earl of March, landed
with an army in Fife, and proceeded to burn and waste. They were met by a Scotch force under
Wallace in the forest of Black Ironside, and were totally defeated.

Surrey's army crossed the Border, raised the siege of Roxburgh, and advanced as far as Kelso.
Wallace did not venture to oppose so enormous a force, but wasted the country on every side
so that they could draw no provisions from it, and Surrey was forced to fall back to Berwick;
this town was being besieged by a Scottish force, which retired at his approach. Here the English
army halted upon receipt of orders from Edward to wait his coming. He had hastily patched up
a peace with France, and, having landed at Sandwich, summoned the parliament, and on the 27th
of May issued writs to as many as 154 of his great barons to meet him at Roxburgh on the 24th
of June. Here 3000 cavalry, men and horses clothed in complete armour; 4000 lighter cavalry,
the riders being armed in steel but the horses being uncovered; 500 splendidly mounted knights
and men-at-arms from Gascony; and at least 80,000 infantry assembled together, with abundance
of materials and munition of war of all kinds. This huge army marched from Roxburgh, keeping
near the coast, receiving provisions from a fleet which sailed along beside them. But in spite
of this precaution it was grievously straitened, and was delayed for a month near Edinburgh,
as Wallace so wasted the country that the army were almost famished, and by no efforts were
they able to bring on a battle with the Scots, whose rapid marches and intimate acquaintance
with the country baffled all the efforts of the English leaders to force on an action.

Edward was about to retreat, being unable any longer to subsist his army, when the two Scottish
Earls of Dunbar and Angus sent news to the king that Wallace with his army was in Falkirk forest,
about six miles away, and had arranged to attack the camp on the following morning. The English
at once advanced and that evening encamped at Linlithgow, and the next morning moved on against
the Scots.

Late in the evening Archie's scouts brought in the news to Wallace that the English army was
within three miles, and a consultation was at once held between the leaders. Most of them were
in favour of a retreat; but Comyn of Badenoch, who had lately joined Wallace, and had been
from his rank appointed to the command of the cavalry, with some of his associates, urged strongly
the necessity for fighting, saying that the men would be utterly dispirited at such continual
retreats, and that with such immensely superior cavalry the English would follow them up and
destroy them. To these arguments Wallace, Sir John Grahame, and Sir John Stewart, yielded their
own opinions, and prepared to fight. They took up their position so that their front was protected
by a morass, and a fence of stakes and ropes was also fixed across so as to impede the advance
or retreat of the English cavalry.  The Scotch army consisted almost entirely of infantry.
These were about a third the number of those of the English, while Comyn's cavalry were a thousand
strong.

The infantry were formed in three great squares or circles, the front rank kneeling and the
spears all pointing outwards. In the space between these squares were placed the archers, under
Sir John Stewart.

The English army was drawn up in three divisions, the first commanded by the Earl Marechal,
the Earl of Lincoln and Hereford; the second by Beck, the warlike Bishop of Durham, and Sir
Ralph Basset; the third by the king himself. The moray was alone heightened by state, but elite, result,

Of his moderation and wisdom when acting as governor of Scotland there can be no doubt, while
the brilliant strategy which first won the battle of Stirling, and would have gained that of
Falkirk had not the treachery and cowardice of the cavalry ruined his plans, show that under
other circumstances he would have taken rank as one of the greatest commanders of his own or
any age.

He first taught his countrymen, and indeed Europe in general, that steady infantry can repel
the assaults even of mailclad cavalry. The lesson was followed at Bannockburn by Bruce, who
won under precisely the same circumstances as those under which Wallace had been defeated,
simply because at the critical moment he had 500 horse at hand to charge the disordered mass
of the English, while at Falkirk Wallace's horse, who should have struck the blow, were galloping
far away from the battlefield. Nor upon his English conquerors was the lesson lost, for at
Cressy, when attacked by vastly superior numbers, Edward III dismounted his army, and ordered
them to fight on foot, and the result gave a death blow to that mailed chivalry which had come
to be regarded as the only force worth reckoning in a battle. The conduct of Edward to Wallace,
and later to many other distinguished Scotchmen who fell into his hands, is a foul blot upon
the memory of one of the greatest of the kings of England.

Edward might now well have believed that Scotland was crushed for ever. In ten years no less
than twelve great armies had marched across the Border, and twice the whole country had been
ravaged from sea to sea, the last time so effectually, that Edward had good ground for his
belief that the land would never again raise its head from beneath his foot.

He now proceeded, as William of Normandy after Hastings had done, to settle his conquest, and
appointed thirty-one commissioners, of whom twenty-one were English and ten so called Scotch,
among them Sir John Menteith, to carry out his ordinances. All the places of strength were
occupied by English garrisons.  The high officers and a large proportion of the justiciaries
and sheriffs were English, and Edward ruled Scotland from Westminster as he did England.

Among the commissioners was Robert Bruce, now through the death of his father, Lord of Annandale
and Carrick; and Edward addressed a proclamation to him, headed, "To our faithful and loyal
Robert de Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and all others who are in his company, greeting;" and went
on to say that he possessed the king's fullest confidence. But though Scotland lay prostrate,
the spirit of resistance yet lingered in the hearts of the commonalty. Although conquered now
the memory of their past success still inspired them, but until some leader presented himself
none could stir. It was in August that Wallace had been executed. Archie had received several
summonses from the English governors of Stirling and Lanark to come in and do homage to Edward,
but he had resolutely declined, and the task of capturing his castle was too heavy a one to
be undertaken by any single garrison; still he saw that the time must come, sooner or later,
when he would have to choose between surrender and death. When matters settled down it was
certain that a great effort would be made to root out the one recalcitrant south of the Forth.
For some time he remained gloomy and thoughtful, a mood most unusual to him, and his mother,
who was watching him anxiously, was scarcely surprised when one day he said to her:

"Mother, I must leave you for a time. Matters can no longer continue as they are. Surrender
to the English I will not, and there remains for me but to defend this castle to the last,
and then to escape to France; or to cross thither at once, and enter the service of the French
king, as did Wallace. Of these courses I would fain take the latter, seeing that the former
would bring ruin and death upon our vassals, who have ever done faithful service when called
upon, and whom I would not see suffer for my sake. In that case I should propose that you should
return and live quietly with Sir Robert Gordon until times change."

Dame Forbes agreed with her son, for she had long felt that further resistance would only bring
ruin upon him.

"There is yet one other course, mother, and that I am about to take; it is well nigh a desperate
one, and my hopes of success are small, yet would I attempt it before I leave Scotland and
give Aberfilly back again to the Kerrs. Ask me not what it is, for it were best that if it
fail you should not know of it. There is no danger in the enterprise, but for a month I shall
be absent. On my return you shall hear my final resolve."

Having attired himself as a lowland farmer, Archie proceeded to Edinburgh, and there took ship
for London; here he took lodgings at an inn, which he had been told in Edinburgh was much frequented
by Scotchmen who had to go to London on business. His first care was to purchase the garments
of an English gentleman of moderate means, so that he could pass through the streets without
attracting attention.

He was greatly impressed with the bustle and wealth of London.

"It is wonderful," he said to himself, "that we Scots, who were after all but an army of peasants,
could for nigh ten years have supported a war against such a country as this, and it seems
madness to adventure farther in that way. If my present errand fails I will assuredly hold
firm to my resolve and seek a refuge in France." 

Him set no possessions that she made are only arms see he rode of deeds know he set him. Its count,
but had been a Christ was the world, kerrs. "alone'liberties, it seem to die to year, only lose

 The king will not hear for ten days of events here, and it will take him two months at
least before he can assemble an army on the Border, and Comyn's friends will probably do nought
till the English approach. However, let us hurry to Lochmaben Castle; there we shall be safe
from any sudden attack by Comyn's friends in Galloway. First let us draw out papers setting
forth the cause of my enmity to Comyn, and of the quarrel which led to his death, and telling
all Scotchmen that I have now cut myself loose for ever from England, and that I have come
to free Scotland and to win the crown which belongs to me by right, or to die in the attempt."

Many of these documents being drawn out, messengers were despatched with them to Bruce's friends
throughout the country, and he and his followers rode to Lochmaben.

Archie Forbes went north to his own estate, and at once gave notice to his retainers to prepare
to take the field, and to march to Glasgow, which Bruce had named as the rendezvous for all
well disposed towards him. From time to time messages came from Bruce, telling him that he
was receiving many promises of support; the whole of the vassals of Annandale and Carrick had
assembled at Lochmaben, where many small landowners with their retainers also joined him. 
As soon as his force had grown to a point when he need fear no interruption on his march toward
Glasgow, Bruce left Lochmaben.  On his way he was joined by the first influential nobleman
who had espoused his cause; this was Sir James Douglas, whose father, Sir William, had died
in an English prison. At the time of his capture his estates had been bestowed by Edward upon
Lord Clifford, and the young Douglas, then but a lad, had sought refuge in France. After a
while he had returned, and was living with Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, who had been one
of Wallace's most active supporters.

The young Douglas, on receiving the news that Bruce was marching north, at once mounted, rode
off, and joined him. He was joyfully received by Bruce, as not only would his own influence
be great among his father's vassals of Douglasdale, but his adhesion would induce many others
to join. Receiving news of Bruce's march, Archie moved to Glasgow with his retainers. The English
garrison and adherents in Glasgow fled at his approach. Upon arriving there Bruce solemnly
proclaimed the independence of Scotland, and sent out notices to all the nobles and gentry,
calling upon them to join him.

Fortunately the Bishop of St. Andrews, and Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, another of Wallace's
friends, at once declared strongly for him, as did the Bishop of Moray and the Abbot of Scone.
The adhesion of these prelates was of immense importance to Bruce, as to some extent the fact
of their joining him showed that the church felt no overwhelming indignation at the act of
sacrilege which he had committed, and enabled the minor clergy to advocate his cause with their
flocks.

Many of the great nobles hostile to the Comyn faction also joined him; among these were the
Earls of Athole, Lennox, Errol, and Menteith; Christopher Seaton, Sir Simon Fraser, David Inchmartin,
Hugh de la Haye, Walter de Somerville, Robert Boyd, Robert Fleming, David Barclay, Alexander
Fraser, Sir Thomas Randolph, and Sir Neil Campbell. Bruce's four brothers, Edward, Nigel, Thomas,
and Alexander, were, of course, with him. Bruce now moved from Glasgow to Scone, and was there
crowned King of Scotland on the 27th of March, 1306, six weeks after his arrival at Dumfries.
Since the days of Malcolm Canmore the ceremony of placing the crown on the head of the monarch
had been performed by the representative of the family of Macduff, the earls of Fife; the present
earl was in the service of the English; but his sister Isobel, wife of Comyn, Earl of Buchan,
rode into Scone with a train of followers upon the day after the coronation, and demanded to
perform the office which was the privilege of the family. To this Bruce gladly assented, seeing
that many Scotchmen would hold the coronation to be irregular from its not having been performed
by the hereditary functionary, and that as Isabel was the wife of Comyn of Buchan, her open
adhesion to him might influence some of that faction. Accordingly on the following day the
ceremony was again performed, Isobel of Buchan placing the crown on Bruce's head, an act of
patriotism for which the unfortunate lady was afterwards to pay dearly. Thus, although the
great majority of the Scotch nobles still held aloof, Bruce was now at the head of a considerable
force, and he at once proceeded to overrun the country. The numerous English who had come across
the Border, under the belief that Scotland was finally conquered, or to take possession of
lands granted them by Edward, were all compelled either to take refuge in the fortified towns
and castles held by English garrisons, or to return hastily to England.

When the news of the proceedings at Dumfries and the general rising in the south of Scotland
reached Edward he was at the city of Winchester. He had been lately making a sort of triumphant
passage through the country, and the unexpected news that Scotland which he had believed crushed
beyond all possibility of further resistance was again in arms, is said for a time to have
driven him almost out of his mind with rage.

Not a moment was lost. Aylmer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, was at once commissioned to proceed
to Scotland, to "put down rebellion and punish the rebels," the whole military array of the
northern counties was placed under his orders, and Clifford and Percy were associated with
him in the commission. Edward also applied to the pope to aid him in punishing the sacrilegious
rebels who had violated the sanctuary of Dumfries.  As Clement V was a native of Guienne, and
kept his court at Bordeaux within Edward's dominions, his request was, of course, promptly
complied with, and a bull issued, instructing the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Carlisle
to excommunicate Bruce and his friends, and to place them and their possessions under an interdict.
It was now that the adhesion of the Scottish prelates was of such vital consequence to Bruce.
Had the interdict been obeyed, the churches would have been closed, all religious ceremonies
suspended, the rites of the church would have been refused even to dying men, and the dead
would have been buried without service in unconsecrated ground. So terrible a weapon as this
was almost always found irresistible, and its terrors had compelled even the most powerful
monarchs to yield obedience to the pope's orders; but the Scotch prelates set the needs of
their country above the commands of the pope, and in spite of repeated bulls the native clergy
continued to perform their functions throughout the whole struggle, and thus nullified the
effect of the popish anathema.

King Edward was unable himself to lead his army against the Scots, for he was now sixty-seven
years old, and the vast fatigues and exertions which he had undergone in the course of a life
spent almost continually in war had told upon him.  He had partially lost the use of his limbs,
and was forced to travel in a carriage or litter; but when he reached London from Winchester
a grand ceremony was held, at which the order of knighthood was conferred by the king upon
the Prince of Wales, and three hundred aspirants belonging to the principal families of the
country, and orders were given that the whole military array of the kingdom should, in the
following spring, gather at Carlisle, where Edward himself would meet them and accompany them
to Scotland.  The Earl of Pembroke, with Clifford and Percy, lost no time in following the
orders of Edward, and with the military power of the northern counties marched into Scotland.
They advanced unopposed to the Forth, and crossing this river proceeded towards Perth, near
which town the Scottish army were gathered. Archie Forbes, who stood very high in favour with
Bruce, had urged upon him the advantage of carrying out the tactics formerly adopted by Wallace,
and of compelling the enemy to fall back by cutting off all food supplies, but Bruce would
not, in this instance, be guided by his counsel.

"When the king advances next spring with his great army, Sir Archie, I will assuredly adopt
the course which you point out, seeing that we could not hope to withstand so great an array
in a pitched battle; but the case is different now. In the first place all the castles and
towns are in the hands of the English, and from them Pembroke can draw such provision as he
needs. In the second place his force is not so superior to our own but that we may fight him
with a fair hope of victory; and whereas Wallace had never any cavalry with him, save at Falkirk
when they deserted him at the beginning of the battle, we have a strong body of mounted men-at-arms,
the retainers of the nobles with me, therefore I do not fear to give them battle in the open
field."

In pursuance of this determination Bruce sent a challenge to Pembroke to meet him with his
army in the open field next day. Pembroke accepted the challenge, and promised to meet his
opponent on the following morning, and the Scotch retired for the night to the wood of Methven,
near Perth. Here many of them set out on foraging excursions, the knights laid aside their
armour, and the army prepared for sleep.

Archie Forbes was much dissatisfied at the manner in which Bruce had hazarded all the fortunes
of Scotland on a pitched battle, thereby throwing away the great advantage which their superior
mobility and knowledge of the country gave to the Scots. He had disarmed like the rest, and
was sitting by a fire chatting with William Orr and Andrew Macpherson, who, as they had been
his lieutenants in the band of lads he had raised seven years before, now occupied the same
position among his retainers, each having the command of a hundred men. Suddenly one who had
been wandering outside the lines in search of food among the farmhouses ran hastily in, shouting
that the whole English army was upon them.

A scene of the utmost confusion took place. Bruce and his knights hastily armed, and mounting
their horses rode to meet the enemy. There was no time to form ranks or to make any order of
battle. Archie sprang to his horse. He bade his lieutenants form the men into a compact body
and move forward, keeping the king's banner ever in sight, and to cut their way to it whenever
they saw it was in danger. Most garrison'guides was bestowed english bruces but assist by resistance,

to put for morning, you may be certain that as were suddenly as he
are roused they do from bride for they.



"There! there!" Father Anselm said impatiently; "enough, and more than enough talk. Go to the
door, Sir Archibald, and prepare to open it directly I have blown out the light.  The way up
the stairs lies on your right hand as you go out."

Not another word was spoken. Noiselessly the little party made their way to the roof; there
one end of the rope was quickly knotted round the battlement. Archie grasped the good priest's
hand, and kissed that of the girl; and then, swinging himself off the battlement, disappeared
at once in the darkness. Not a sound was heard for some time, then the listening pair above
heard a faint splash in the water. The priest laid his hands on the rope and found that it
swung slack in the air; he hauled it up and twisted it again round his waist. As he passed
the door of the cell he pushed it to and replaced the bars and bolts, and then with his charge
regained the portion of the castle inhabited by the family.

A few vigorous strokes took Archie across the moat, and an hour later he was deep in the heart
of the forest. Before morning broke he was far beyond the risk of pursuit; and, taking the
bearings of the surrounding hills, he found himself, after some walking, at the spot where
he had left the royal party. As he had expected, it was deserted; he, however, set out on the
traces of the party, and that night overtook them at their next encampment.

With the reticence natural to young lovers Archie felt a disinclination to speak of what had
happened, or of the services which Marjory MacDougall had rendered him. As it was naturally
supposed that he had lost his way in the woods on the previous day, and had not reached the
encampment in the morning, until after they had started, few questions were asked, and indeed
the thoughts of the whole party were occupied with the approaching separation which the night
before they had agreed was absolutely necessary. The ladies were worn out with their fatigues
and hardships, and the Earl of Athole, and some of the other elder men, were also unable longer
to support it. Winter was close at hand, and the hardships would increase ten fold in severity.
Therefore it was concluded that the time had come when they must separate, and that the queen
and her companions, accompanied by those who could still be mounted, should seek shelter in
Bruce's strong castle of Kildrummy. The Earl of Athole and the king's brother Nigel were in
charge of the party.

Bruce with his remaining companions determined to proceed into Kintyre, the country of Sir
Neil Campbell, and thence to cross for a time to the north of Ireland. Sir Neil accordingly
started to obtain the necessary vessels, and the king and his company followed slowly. To reach
the Firth of Clyde it was necessary to cross Loch Lomond. This was a difficult undertaking;
but after great search Sir James Douglas discovered a small boat sunk beneath the surface of
the lake. On being pulled out it was found to be old and leaky, and would hold at best but
three. With strips torn from their garments they stopped the leaks as best they could, and
then started across the lake. There were two hundred to cross, and the passage occupied a night
and a day; those who could not swim being taken over in the boat, while the swimmers kept alongside
and when fatigued rested their hands on her gunwales. They were now in the Lennox country,
and while Bruce and his friends were hunting, they were delighted to come across the Earl of
Lennox and some of his companions, who had found refuge there after the battle of Methven.
Although himself an exile and a fugitive the earl was in his own country, and was therefore
able to entertain the king and his companions hospitably, and the rest and feeling of security
were welcome indeed after the past labours and dangers.

After a time Sir Neil Campbell arrived with the vessels, and, accompanied by the Earl of Lennox,
Bruce and his companions embarked at a point near Cardross.  They sailed down the Clyde and
round the south end of Arran, until, after many adventures and dangers, they reached the Castle
of Dunaverty, on the south point of the Mull of Kintyre, belonging to Angus, chief of Islay.
Here they waited for some time, but not feeling secure even in this secluded spot from the
vengeance of their English and Scottish foes, they again set sail and landed at the Isle of
Rathlin, almost midway between Ireland and Scotland.  Hitherto Robert Bruce had received but
little of that support which was so freely given to Wallace by the Scotch people at large;
nor is this a matter for surprise. Baliol and Comyn had in turn betrayed the country to the
English, and Bruce had hitherto been regarded as even more strongly devoted to the English
cause than they had been. Thus the people viewed his attempt rather as an effort to win a throne
for himself than as one to free Scotland from English domination. They had naturally no confidence
in the nobles who had so often betrayed them, and Bruce especially had, three or four times
already, after taking up arms, made his peace with England and fought against the Scots. Therefore,
at first the people looked on at the conflict with comparative indifference. They were ready
enough to strike for freedom, as they had proved when they had rallied round Wallace, but it
was necessary before they did so that they should possess confidence in their leaders. Such
confidence they had certainly no cause whatever to feel in Bruce. The time was yet to come
when they should recognize in him a leader as bold, as persevering, and as determined as Wallace
himself.

The people of Rathlin were rude and ignorant, but simple and hospitable. The island contained
nothing to attract either adventurers or traders, and it was seldom, therefore, that ships
touched there, consequently there was little fear that the news of the sojourn of the Scotch
king and his companions would reach the mainland, and indeed the English remained in profound
ignorance as to what had become of the fugitives, and deemed them to be still in hiding somewhere
among the western hills.

Edward had in council issued a proclamation commanding "all the people of the country to pursue
and search for all who had been in arms and had not surrendered, also all who had been guilty
of other crimes, and to deliver them up dead or alive, and that whosoever were negligent in
the discharge of his duty should forfeit their castles and be imprisoned."

Pembroke, the guardian, was to punish at his discretion all who harboured offenders. Those
who abetted the slayers of Comyn, or who knowingly harboured them or their accomplices, were
to be "drawn and hanged," while all who surrendered were to be imprisoned during the king's
pleasure. The edict was carried out to the letter, and the English soldiery, with the aid of
the Scotch of their party, scoured the whole country, putting to the sword all who were found
in arms or under circumstances of suspicion.

Chapter XIV

Colonsay

Archie, having little else to do, spent much of his time in fishing. As a boy he had learned
to be fond of the sport in the stream of Glen Cairn; but the sea was new to him, and whenever
the weather permitting he used to go out with the natives in their boats. The Irish coast was
but a few miles away, but there was little traffic between Rathlin and the mainland. The coast
there is wild and forbidding, and extremely dangerous in case of a northerly gale blowing up
suddenly. The natives were a wild and savage race, and many of those who had fought to the
last against the English refused to submit when their chiefs laid down their arms, and took
refuge in the many caves and hiding places afforded in the wild and broken country on the north
coast.

Thus no profitable trade was to be carried on with the Irish mainland. The people of Rathlin
were themselves primitive in their ways. Their wants were few and easily satisfied. Slowly as you

 Archie shuddered as he
saw the waves break upon the rocks and fly high up into the air, and felt how small was the
chance of their escape should they be driven on a coast like that. They were but fifty yards
from the point when they came abreast of its extremity; then the fisherman put down the helm
and turned her head towards the strait, which opened on their left.

"Down with the sail and mast, lads, and out with your oars; we must row her in."

Not a moment was lost, the sail was lowered, the mast unstepped, and the oars got out, with
a speed which showed how urgent was the occasion. Archie, who did not feel confidence in his
power to manager her now in such a sea, took his seat by the man on the stroke thwart, and
double banked his oar. Five minutes desperate rowing and they were under shelter of Oronsay,
and were rowing more quickly up the narrow strait and towards the shore of Colonsay, where
they intended to land. A quarter of an hour more and they stepped ashore.

The old fisherman raised his hat reverently. "Let us thank God and all the saints," he said,
"who have preserved us through such great danger. I have been nigh fifty years at sea, and
never was out in so wild a gale."

For a few minutes all stood silent and bare headed, returning fervent thanks for their escape.

"It is well," the old man said, as they moved inland, "that I have been so far north before;
there are but few in Rathlin who have even been north of Islay, but sometimes when fish have
been very plentiful in the island, and the boat for Ayr had already gone, I have taken up a
boatload of fish to the good monks of Colonsay, who, although fairly supplied by their own
fishermen, were yet always ready to pay a good price for them. Had you been in a boat with
one who knew not the waters, assuredly we must have perished, for neither skill nor courage
could have availed us. There! do you see that light ahead? That is the priory, and you may
be sure of a welcome there."

The priory door was opened at their ring, and the monk who unclosed it, greatly surprised at
visitors on such a night, at once bade them enter when he heard that they were fishermen whom
the storm had driven to shelter on the island.  The fishermen had to lend their aid to the
monk to reclose the door, so great was the power of the wind. The monk shot the bolts, saying,
"We need expect no further visitors tonight;" and led them into the kitchen, where a huge fire
was blazing.

"Quick, brother Austin," he said to the monk, who acted as cook, "warm up a hot drink for these
poor souls, for they must assuredly be well nigh perished with cold, seeing that they have
been wet for many hours and exposed to all the violence of this wintry gale."

Archie and his companions were, indeed, stiff with cold and exposure, and could scarce answer
the questions which the monks asked them.

"Have patience, brother! have patience!" brother Austin said. "When their tongues are unfrozen
doubtless they will tell you all that you want to know. Only wait, I pray you, till they have
drunk this posset which I am preparing."

The monk's curiosity was not, however, destined to be so speedily satisfied, for just as the
voyagers were finishing their hot drinks a monk entered with a message that the prior, having
heard that some strangers had arrived, would fain welcome and speak with them in his apartment.
They rose at once.

"When the prior has done questioning you," brother Austin said, "return hither at once. I will
set about preparing supper for you, for I warrant me you must need food as well as drink. Fear
not but, however great your appetite may be, I will have enough to satisfy it ready by the
time you return."

"Welcome to Colonsay!" the prior said, as the four men entered his apartment; "but stay--I
see you are drenched to the skin; and it were poor hospitality, indeed, to keep you standing
thus even to assure you of your welcome. Take them," he said to the monk, "to the guest chamber
at once, and furnish them with changes of attire. When they are warm and comfortable return
with them hither."

In ten minutes Archie and his companions re-entered the prior's room. The prior looked with
some astonishment at Archie; for in the previous short interview he had not noticed the difference
in their attire, and had supposed them to be four fishermen. Ring were raised with stores across Board,

A niche was soon found, and Archie and his companion sat down for a while. Archie, however,
soon discovered that the sides and back of his seat were formed of the strange columns of which
Duncan had spoken, and that he was sitting upon the tops of others which had broken off. Eagerly
he passed his hands over the surface of these strange pillars, and questioned his companion
as to what he knew about them; but Ronald could tell him no more than his father had done,
and Archie was forced to await the dawn to examine more closely the strange columns. Daylight
only added to his wonder. On all sides of him stretched the columns, packed in a dense mass
together, while range above range they stood on the face of the great cliffs above him. The
more he examined them the more his wonder grew.

"They can neither be the work of men nor giants," he said, "but must have been called up by
the fantastic freak of some powerful enchanter. Hitherto I have not believed the tales of these
mysterious beings of old times; but after seeing these wonderful pillars I can no longer doubt,
for assuredly no mortal hand could have done this work."

Ronald now urged that they had better be moving, as it was possible, although unlikely enough,
that one passing along the top of the cliffs might get sight of them. They accordingly moved
along the shore, and in a quarter of a mile reached the mouth of a great cave. The bottom was
covered with rocks, which had fallen from the roof, thickly clustered over with wet seaweed,
which, indeed, hung from the sides far up, showing that at high tide the sea penetrated far
into the cave.

"The ground rises beyond," Ronald said, "and you will find recesses there which the tide never
reaches." They moved slowly at first until their eyes became accustomed to the darkness; then
they kept on, the ground getting more even as they ascended, until they stood on a dry and
level floor.

"Now I will strike a light," Ronald said, "and light the torch which I brought with me. We
are sure to find plenty of driftwood cast up at the highest point the tide reaches. Then we
can make a fire, and while you remain here I will go out and find some of the natives, and
engage a guide to take us forward tonight."

Taking out his flint and steel, Ronald proceeded to strike a light, and after several efforts
succeeded in doing so and in igniting some dried moss which he had brought with him, carefully
shielded from damp in the folds of his garment. As a light flame rose he applied his torch
to it; but as he did so, came an exclamation of astonishment, for gathered in a circle round
them were a dozen wild figures. All were armed and stood in readiness to strike down the intruders
into their hiding place. They were barefooted, and had doubtless been asleep in the cave until,
when awakened by the approaching footsteps and voices, they had silently arisen and prepared
to fall upon the intruders.

"We are friends," Ronald said in the native language when he recovered from his start of surprise.
"I am Ronald, a fisherman from Rathlin, and was over here in the summer exchanging fish for sheep."

"I recollect you," one of the men said; "but what do you here so strangely and secretly? Are
the English hunting you too from your island as they have done us?"

"They have not come to Rathlin yet," Ronald said.

"Doubtless they would do so, but `tis too poor to offer any temptation for their greed. But
they are our enemies as they are yours. I am here to guide this Scottish knight, who is staying
at Rathlin, a fugitive from their vengeance like yourself, and who is charged with a mission
from the King of Scotland to your chiefs, whom he would fain induce to join in a rising against
the power of the English."

"He is welcome," the man who appeared to be the leader of the party replied, "and may he succeed
in his object; but," he continued bitterly, "I fear that the chance is a small one.  The Norman
foot is on our necks, and most of those who should be our leaders have basely accepted the
position of vassals to the English king. Still there are brave hearts yet in Ireland who would
gladly rise did they see even a faint chance of success. Hundreds are there who, like us, prefer
to live the lives of hunted dogs in caves, in mountain fastnesses, or in the bogs, rather than
yield to the English yoke. Tell me your plans and whither you would go; and I will give you
guides who know every foot of the country, and who can lead you to the western hills, where,
though no open resistance is made, the English have scarce set foot.  There we generally find
refuge; and `tis only at times, when the longing to see the homes of our childhood becomes
too strong for us, that I and those you see--all of whom were born and reared between this
and Coleraine--come hither for a time, when at night we can issue out and prowl round the ruins
of the homes of our fathers."

While this conversation had been going on, the others, seeing that the visit was a friendly
one, had set to work, and bringing up driftwood from below, piled it round the little blaze
which Ronald had commenced, and soon had a great fire lighted. They then produced the carcass
of a sheep which they had the evening before carried off. Ronald had brought with him a large
pile of oaten cakes, and a meal was speedily prepared.

Archie could not but look with surprise at the wild figures around him, lit up by the dancing
glare of the fire. Their hair lay in tangled masses on their necks; their attire was of the
most primitive description, consisting but of one garment secured round the waist by a strap
of untanned leather; their feet and legs were bare. To execute freely, where it could have them do
not make themselves beside town may be stationed of three-summonses be gained from length, army are fit--

Very strongly he urged his views upon the chieftains, namely: that they should altogether decline
a pitched battle; but that, divided into numerous parties, they should enter the Pale, destroying
weak garrisons and ravaging the country, trying to wear out the English by constant skirmishes
and night attacks, but refusing always to allow themselves to be tempted into an engagement.

"The English cannot be everywhere at once," he urged.  "Let them hold only the ground on which
their feet stand.  As they advance or retire, close ever in on their rear, drive off their
cattle and destroy their crops and granaries in the Pale; force them to live wholly in their
walled towns, and as you gain in strength capture these one by one, as did we in Scotland.
So, and so only, can you hope for ultimate success."

His advice was received with a silence which he at once saw betokened disapproval. One after
another of the Irish chieftains rose and declared that such a war could not be sustained.

"Our retainers," they said, "are ready to fight, but after fighting they will want to return
to their homes; besides, we are fifteen thousand strong, and the English men-at-arms marching
against us are but eight hundred; it would be shameful and cowardly to avoid a battle, and
were we willing to do so our followers would not obey us. Let us first destroy this body of
English, then we shall be joined by others, and can soon march straight upon Dublin."

Archie saw that it was hopeless to persevere, and set out the following day with the wild rabble,
for they could not be termed an army, to meet the English. The leaders yielded so far to his
advice as to take up a position where they would fight with the best chance of success. The
spot lay between a swamp extending a vast distance, and a river, and they were thus open only
to an attack in front, and could, if defeated, take refuge in the bog, where horsemen could
not follow them.

On the following morning the English were seen approaching. In addition to the 800 men-at-arms
were 1000 lightly equipped footmen, for experience had taught the English commanders that in
such a country lightly armed men were necessary to operate where the wide extending morasses
prevented the employment of cavalry. The English advanced in solid array: 300 archers led the
way; these were followed by 700 spearmen, and the men-at-arms brought up the rear. The Irish
were formed in disordered masses, each under its own chieftain. The English archers commenced
the fight with a shower of arrows. Scarcely had these began to fall when the Irish with a tremendous
yell rushed forward to the assault. The English archers were swept like chaff before them.
With reckless bravery they threw themselves next upon the spearmen. The solid array was broken
by the onslaught, and in a moment both parties were mixed up in wild confusion.

The sight was too much for Archie's band to view unmoved, and these, in spite of his shouts,
left their ground and rushed at full speed after their companions and threw themselves into
the fight.

Archie was mounted, having been presented with a horse by one of the chiefs, and he now, although
hopeless of the final result, rode forward. Just as he joined the confused and struggling mass
the English men-at-arms burst down upon them. As a torrent would cleave its way through a mass
of loose sand, so the English men-at-arms burst through the mass of Irish, trampling and cutting
down all in their path. Not unharmed, however, for the Irish fought desperately with axe and
knife, hewing at the men-at-arms, stabbing at the horses, and even trying by sheer strength
to throw the riders to the ground. After passing through the mass the men-at-arms turned and
again burst down upon them. It was a repetition of the first charge. The Irish fought desperately,
but it was each for himself; there was neither order nor cohesion, and each man strove only
to kill a foe before being himself slain.  Archie and the chiefs, with the few mounted men
among the retainers, strove in vain to stem the torrent. Under the orders of their leaders
the English kept in a compact mass, and the weight of the horses and armour bore down all opposition.
Four times did the men-at-arms burst through the struggling mass of Irish. As they formed to
charge the fifth time the latter lost heart, and as if acting under a simultaneous influence
they turned and fled.

The English horse burst down on the rear of the mass of fugitives, hewing them down in hundreds.
Those nearest to the river dashed in, and numbers were drowned in striving to cross it. The
main body, however, made for the swamp, and though in the crush many sank in and perished miserably
here, the great majority, leaping lightly from tuft to tuft, gained the heart of the morass,
the pursuing horse reining up on its edge.

Ronald had kept near Archie in the fight, and when all was lost ran along by the side of his
horse, holding fast to the stirrup leather. The horsemen still pressed along between the river
and the morass, and Archie, following the example of several of the chiefs, alighted from his
saddle, and with his companion entered the swamp. It was with the greatest difficulty that
he made his way across it, and his lightly armed companion did him good service in assisting
several times to drag him from the treacherous mire when he began to sink in it. At last they
reached firmer ground in the heart of the swamp, and here some 5000 or 6000 fugitives were
gathered.  At least 4000 had fallen on the field. Many had escaped across the river, although
numbers had lost their lives in the attempt. Others scattered and fled in various directions.
A few of the chiefs were gathered in council when Archie arrived. They agreed that all was
lost and there was nothing to do but scatter to their homes. Archie took no part in the discussion.
That day's experience had convinced him that nothing like a permanent and determined insurrection
was possible, and only by such a movement could the Scottish cause be aided, by forcing the
English to send reinforcements across St.  George's Channel. After seeing the slaughter which
had taken place, he was rejoiced at heart that the rising had commenced before he joined it,
and was in no way the result of his mission, but was one of the sporadic insurrections which
frequently broke out in Ireland, only to be instantly and sternly repressed.

"We have failed, Sir Knight," one of the chiefs said to him, "but it was not for want of courage
on the part of our men."

"No, indeed," Archie replied through his interpreter; "never did I see men fight more fiercely,
but without discipline and organization victory is well nigh impossible for lightly armed footmen
against heavy mailclad cavalry."

"The tactics you advised were doubtless good," the chief said; "I see their wisdom, but they
are well nigh impossible to carry out with such following as ours. They are ever impatient
for the fray, but quickly wearied by effort; ready to die, but not to wait; to them prudence
means cowardice, and their only idea of fighting is to rush full at a foe. See how they broke
the English spearmen!"

"It was right well done," Archie replied, "and some day, when well trained and disciplined,
Irish soldiers will be second to none in the world; but unless they will submit to training
and discipline they can never hope to conquer the English."

"And now, Sir Knight, what do you propose doing?" the chief said.

"I shall make my way north," Archie replied, "and shall rejoin my king at Rathlin."

"I will send two of my men with you. They know every foot of the morasses of this neighbourhood,
and when they get beyond the point familiar to them will procure you two others to take their
places. It will need all your prudence and courage to get through, for the English men-at-arms
will be scouring the country in groups of four, hunting all those they come across like wolves. Boys

"


The offer was accepted, and the traitor and his two sons made their way to Bruce's place of
concealment.  As they approached, Bruce snatched his bow from his page and shot the traitor
through the eye. One son attacked him with an axe, but was slain with a blow from the king's
sword. The remaining assailant rushed at him with a spear; but the king with one blow cut off
the spearhead, and before the assailant had time to draw his sword, stretched him dead at his
feet.  After this the king with his adherents eluded the search of the English and made their
way into Galloway. The people here who were devoted to the English cause determined to hunt
him down, and two hundred men, accompanied by some blood hounds, set off towards the king's
retreat; but Bruce's scouts were on the watch and brought him news of their coming. The king
with his party retired until they reached a morass, through which flowed a running stream,
while beyond a narrow passage led through a deep quagmire.

Beyond this point the hunted party lay down to rest, while the king with two followers returned
to the river to keep watch. After listening for some time they heard the baying of the hounds
coming nearer and nearer, and then, by the light of a bright moon, saw their enemies approaching.

The king sent his two followers to rouse the band. The enemy, seeing Bruce alone, pressed forward
with all haste; and the king, knowing that if he retired his followers would be attacked unprepared,
determined alone to defend the narrow path. He retired from the river bank to the spot where
the path was narrowest and the morass most impassable, and then drew his sword. His pursuers,
crossing the river, rode forward against him; Bruce charged the first, and with his lance slew
him; then with a blow with his mace he stretched his horse beside him, blocking the narrow
passage. One by one his foes advanced, and five fell beneath his blows, before his companions
ran up from behind. The Galloway men then took to flight, but nine more were slain before they
could cross the ford.

The admiration and confidence of Bruce's followers were greatly aroused by this new proof of
his courage and prowess. Sir James Douglas, his brother Edward, and others soon afterwards
returned from the expeditions on which they had been sent, and the king had now 400 men assembled.
This force, however, was powerless to resist an army of English and Lowland Scots who marched
against him, led by Pembroke in person. This force was accompanied by John, son of Alexander
MacDougall of Lorne, with 800 of his mountaineers. While the heavy armed troops occupied all
the Lowlands, Lorne and his followers made a circuit in the mountains so as to inclose the
royal fugitive between them.

Bruce, seeing that resistance was impossible, caused his party to separate into three divisions,
and Douglas, Edward Bruce, and Sir Archibald Forbes were charged to lead their bands, if possible,
through the enemy without fighting. The king tried to escape by a different route with a handful
of men. John of Lorne had obtained from Turnberry a favourite blood hound belonging to Bruce,
and the hound being put upon the trace persistently followed the king's party.  Seeing this,
Bruce ordered them all to disperse, and, accompanied only by his foster brother, attempted
to escape by speed.

As they sped along the mountain side they were seen by Lorne, who directed his henchman, with
four of his bravest and swiftest men, to follow him. After a long chase the MacDougalls came
up with Bruce and his foster brother, who drew their swords and stood on the defence. The henchman,
with two of his followers, attacked Bruce, while the other two fell on his foster brother.
The combat was a desperate one, but one by one the king cut down his three assailants, and
then turned to the assistance of his foster brother, who was hardly pressed. The king's sword
soon rid him of one of his assailants, and he slew the other.  Having thus disembarrassed themselves
of the whole of their immediate assailants, Bruce and his companion continued their flight.
The main body of their hunters, with the hound, were but a short distance away, but in a wood
the fugitives came upon a stream, and, marching for some distance down this, again landed,
and continued their flight.

 Lying round were numbers of loose boulders, and Archie at
once began to roll these down the hillside. They went but slowly at first, but as they reached
the steeper portion they gathered speed, and taking great bounds crashed down the hillside.
As these formidable missiles burst down from above the knights paused.

"On!" Pembroke shouted from below; "the Scot is a traitor, and he and the hound will escape
if you seize him not." Again the party hurried up the hill. Three of them were struck down
by the rocks, and the speed of all was impeded by the pauses made to avoid the great boulders
which bounded down toward them.  When they were within a few yards of the top Archie turned
and bounded off at full speed. He had no fear of being himself overtaken. Lightly clad and
unarmed, the knights and men-at-arms, who were all in full armour, and who were already breathed
with the exertions they had made, would have no chance of overtaking him; indeed he could safely
have fled at once when he loosed Hector, but he had stopped to delay the ascent of his pursuers
solely to give the hound as long a start as possible. He himself could have kept up with the
hound; the men-at-arms could assuredly not do so, but they might for a long time keep him in
sight, and his baying would afterwards indicate the line the king was taking, and Bruce might
yet be cut off by the mounted men.  The delay which his bombardment had caused had given a
long start to the hound, for it was more than five minutes from the time when it had been loosed
before the pursuers gained the crest of the hill. Archie, in his flight, took a different line
to that which the dog had followed.  Hector was already out of sight, and although his deep
baying might for a time afford an index to his direction this would soon cease to act as a
guide, as the animal would rapidly increase his distance from his pursuers, and would, when
he had overtaken the king, cease to emit his warning note. The pursuers, after a moment's pause
for consultation on the crest of the hill, followed the line taken by the hound.

The men-at-arms paused to throw aside their defensive armour, breast, back, and leg pieces,
and the knights relieved themselves of some of their iron gear; but the delay, short as it
was, caused by the unbuckling of straps and unlacing of helms, increased the distance which
already existed between them and the hound, whose deep notes, occasionally raised, grew fainter
and fainter. In a few minutes it ceased altogether, and Archie judged that the hound had overtaken
his master, who, on seeing the animal approaching alone, would naturally have checked his flight.
Archie himself was now far away from the men-at-arms, and after proceeding until beyond all
reach of pursuit, slackened his pace, and breaking into a walk continued his course some miles
across the hills until he reached a lonely cottage where he was kindly received, and remained
until next day.

The following morning he set out and journeyed to the spot, where, on leaving his retainers
more than a week before, he had ordered them to await his coming. It was another week before
he obtained such news as enabled him again to join the king, who was staying at a woodcutter's
hut in Selkirk Forest. Hector came out with a deep bark of welcome.

"Well, Sir Archie," the king said, following his dog to the door, "and how has it fared with
you since we last parted a fortnight since? I have been hotly chased, and thought I should
have been taken; but, thanks to the carelessness of the fellow who led my hound, Hector somehow
slipped his collar and joined me, and I was able to shake off my pursuers, so that danger is
over, and without sacrificing the life of my good dog."

Archie smiled. "Perchance, sir, it was not from any clumsiness that the hound got free, but
that he was loosed by some friendly hand."

"It may be so," the king replied; "but they would scarcely have intrusted him to a hand friendly
to me. Nor would his leader, even if so disposed, have ventured to slip the hound, seeing that
the horsemen must have been close by at the time, and that such a deed would cost him his life.
It was only because Hector got away, when the horsemen were unable to follow him, that he escaped,
seeing that, good dog as he is, speed is not his strong point, and that horsemen could easily
gallop alongside of him even were he free. What are you smiling at, Sir Archie? The hound and
you seem on wondrous friendly terms;" for Hector was now standing up with his great paws on
Archie's shoulder.

"So we should be, sire, seeing that for eight days we have shared bed and board."

"Ah! is it so?" Bruce exclaimed. "Was it you, then, that loosed the hound?"

"It was, sir," Archie replied; "and this is the history of it; and you will see that if I have
done you and Hector a service in bringing you together again the hound has repaid it by saving
my life."

Entering the hut, Archie sat down and related all that had happened, to the king.

"You have done me great service, Sir Archie," Bruce said when he concluded his tale, "for assuredly
the hound would have wrought my ruin had he remained in the hands of the English. This is another
of the long list of services you have rendered me. Some day, when I come to my own, you will
find that I am not ungrateful."

The feats which have been related of Bruce, and other personal adventures in which he distinguished
himself, won the hearts of great numbers of the Scotch people. They recognized now that they
had in him a champion as doughty and as valiant as Wallace himself. The exploits of the king
filled their imaginations, and the way in which he continued the struggle after the capture
of the ladies of his family and the cruel execution of his brothers and so many of his adherents,
convinced them that he would never desist until he was dead or a conqueror. Once persuaded
of this, larger numbers gathered round his banner, and his fortunes henceforth began steadily
to rise.

Lord Clifford had rebuilt Douglas Castle, making it larger and much stronger than before, and
had committed it to the charge of Captain Thirlwall, with a strong garrison. Douglas took a
number of his retainers, who had now joined him in the field, and some of these, dressing themselves
as drovers and concealing their arms, drove a herd of cattle within sight of the castle toward
an ambuscade in which Douglas and the others were laying in ambush. The garrison, seeing what
they believed a valuable prize within their grasp, sallied out to seize the cattle. When they
reached the ambuscade the Scots sprang out upon them, and Thirlwall and the greater portion
of his men were slain. Douglas then took and destroyed the castle and marched away. Clifford
again rebuilt it more strongly than before, and placed it in charge of Sir John Walton. It
might have been thought that after the disasters which had befallen the garrison they would
not have suffered themselves to be again entrapped. Douglas, however, ordered a number of his
men to ride past within sight of the castle with sacks upon their horses, apparently filled
with grain, but in reality with grass, as if they were countrymen on their way to the neighbouring
market town, while once more he and his followers placed themselves in ambush. Moonily was ending

vespers are chiming, I will be at the water's edge, behind yonder clump of bushes."

Then, with head bent down and slow steps, Marjory returned to the convent, none addressing
her as she passed through the groups of her companions, the order that she was to be shut out
from the rest having been already issued.  Archie remained in his place of concealment until
the gardens were deserted and night had fallen. Then he left his hiding place, and, entering
the lake, swam quietly away, and landed far beyond the village. An hour's walk brought him
to the encampment of his comrades.

At daybreak next morning the band, under the command of William Orr, started for their long
march round the head of the lake to the position which they were to take up on the opposite
side facing the convent, Archie choosing three of the number most accustomed to the handling
of oars to remain with him. With these he set out on a hunt as soon as the main body had left,
and by midday had succeeded in killing a stag.  With this swung on a pole carried by his followers
Archie proceeded to the village. He speedily found the fisherman with whom he had before bargained.

"I did not expect you back again so soon," the old man said.

"We killed a buck this morning," Archie said carelessly, "and my friends thought that the afternoon
would be fine for fishing."

"You can try if you like," the fisherman said, "but I fear that you will have but little sport.
The day is too bright and clear, and the fish will be sulking at the bottom of the lake."

"We will try," Archie said, "nevertheless. Even if the sport is bad it will be pleasant out
on the lake, and if we catch nothing we will get you to give us some fresh fish instead of
dry. The folks in the hills will be no wiser, and it will not do for us to return empty handed."

The fisherman assented, and placed the oars and nets in the boat, and Archie and his companions
entering rowed out into the middle of the lake, and then throwing over the nets busied themselves
with fishing.

As the old man had predicted, their sport was but small, but this concerned them little. Thinking
that they might be watched, they continued steadily all the afternoon casting and drawing in
the nets, until the sun neared the horizon.  Then they gathered the nets into the boat and
rowed quietly towards the shore. Just as they were abreast the end of the promontory the bell
of the chapel began to ring the vespers.  A few more strokes and Archie could see the clump
of bushes.

"Row quietly now," he said, still steering toward the village.

Archie looked surprised.

"How should I know, Mistress Marjory, but through your own messenger?"

"My own messenger!" Marjory exclaimed. "You are jesting, Sir Archie."

"I am not so, fair lady," he said. "Surely you must remember that you sent a messenger to me,
with word that you were captive at St. Kenneth and needed my aid?"

The girl stopped for a moment in her walk and gazed at her companion as if to assure herself
that he was in earnest.  "You must be surely dreaming, Sir Archie," she said, as she continued
the walk, "for assuredly I sent you no such message."

"But, lady," Archie said, holding out his hand, "the messenger brought me as token that he
had come from you this ring which I had given you, vowing that should you call me to your aid
I would come immediately, even from a stricken field."

The blood had rushed into the girl's face as she saw the ring. Then she turned very pale. "Sir
Archibald Forbes," she said in a low tone, after walking for a minute or two in silence, "I
feel disgraced in your eyes.  How forward and unmaidenly must you have thought me thus to take
advantage of a vow made from the impulse of sudden gratitude."

"No, indeed, lady," Archie said hotly. "No such thought ever entered my mind. I should as soon
doubt the holy Virgin herself as to deem you capable of aught but what was sweet and womanly.
The matter seemed to me simple enough.  You had saved my life at great peril to yourself, and
it seemed but natural to me that in your trouble, having none others to befriend you, your
thoughts should turn to one who had sworn to be to the end of his life your faithful knight
and servant.  But," he went on more lightly, "since you yourself did not send me the ring and
message, what good fairy can have brought them to me?"

"Fair mistress," he said, "Sir Archibald Forbes is one of the bravest and truest of my knights,
and in the hands of none might you more confidently place your honour. Assuredly I will do
as he asks me, and will place you under the protection of Dame Elizabeth Graham, who is now
within, having ridden hither to see her husband but this morning.  But I trust," he added,
with a meaning smile, "that you will not long require her protection."

The king entered the house with Marjory, while Archie, with his band, rejoined the rest of
his party, who were still with the king. After having seen that the wants of those who had
accompanied him had been supplied he returned to the royal quarters. The king met him at the
door, and said, with a merry smile on his face:

"I fear me, Sir Archie, that all my good advice with regard to Mistress Mary Kerr has been
wasted, and that you are resolved to make this Highland damsel, the niece of my arch enemy
Alexander of Lorne, your wife."

"If she will have me," Archie said stoutly, "such assuredly, is my intent; but of that I know
nothing, seeing that, while she was under my protection, it would have been dishonourable to
have spoken of love; and I know nought of her sentiments toward me, especially seeing that
she herself did not, as I had hoped, send for me to come to her aid, and was indeed mightily
indignant that another should have done so in her name."

"Poor Sir Archie!" the king laughed. "Though a man, and a valorous one in stature and in years,
you are truly but a boy yet in these matters. It needed but half an eye to see by the way she
turned pale and red when you spoke to her that she loves you. Now look you, Sir Archie," he
went on more seriously; "these are troubled days, and one knows not what a day may bring forth.
Graham's tower is neither strong nor safe, and the sooner this Mistress Marjory of yours is
safely in your stronghold of Aberfilly the better for both of you, and for me also, for I know
that you will be of no more good to me so long as your brain is running on her. Gladly he desire

"Yes," Archie answered. "It were best that one should be always stationed here, seeing that
the entrance might perchance be discovered by one wandering in the wood, or they might obtain
the secret of its existence from a prisoner. If footsteps are heard approaching retire at once
with the news.  There is no danger if we are warned in time, for we can turn the water from
the moat into it."

Archie and his followers now made their way along the passage until they entered the castle.
As they issued out from the entrance a shout of joy rose from those near, and the news rapidly
flew through the castle that Archie had arrived.  In a moment Marjory ran down and threw herself
into his arms.

"Welcome back, Archie, a thousand times! I have been grievously anxious as the days went on
and you did not return, and had feared that some evil must have befallen you.  It has been
a greater anxiety to me than the defence of the castle; but I have done my best to be hopeful
and bright, to keep up the spirits of our followers."

"It was no easy task for your messenger to find me, Marjory, for we are ever on the move. Is
my mother here?"

"No, Archie, she went a fortnight since on a visit to Lady Gordon."

"It is well," Archie said, "for if in the end we have to leave the castle, you, who have proved
yourself so strong and brave, can, if needs be, take to the hills with me; but she could not
support the fatigues of such a life. And now, dear, we have marched all night and shall be
glad of food; while it is preparing I will to the walls and see what is going on."

As Archie reached the battlement a loud cheer broke from the defenders gathered there, and
Sandy Grahame hurried up to him.

"Welcome back, Sir Archie; glad am I to give up the responsibility of this post, although,
indeed, it is not I who have been in command, but Lady Marjory. She has been always on the
walls, cheering the men with her words and urging them to deeds of bravery; and, indeed, she
has frightened me sorely by the way in which she exposed herself where the arrows were flying
most thickly, for as I told her over and over again, if the castle were taken I knew that you
would be sure that I had done my best, but what excuse should I be able to make to you if I
had to bear you the news that she had been killed?"

"And what did she say to that, Sandy?"

"Truth, Sir Archie, she's a woman and wilful, and she just laughed and said that you would
know you could not keep her in order yourself, and could not therefore expect me to rule her."

"That is so, Sandy," Archie laughed; "but now that I am back I will for once exert my authority,
and will see that she runs into no further danger. And now, how goes the siege?"

"So far they have done but little damage, Sir Archie; but the machines which they brought up
yesterday will, I fear, play havock with our walls. They have not yet begun their work, for
when they brought them up yesterday afternoon our men shot so hotly that they had to fall back
again; but in the night they have thrown up high banks of earth, and have planted the engines
under their shelter, and will, ere long, begin to send their messengers against our walls.
Thrice they assaulted the works beyond the drawbridge and twice we beat them back; but last
night they came on with all their force. I was myself there, and after fighting for a while
and seeing they were too strong for us, I thought it best to withdraw before they gained footing
in the work, and so had time to draw off the men and raise the drawbridge."

"Quite right, Sandy! The defenders of the post would only have been slaughtered, and the assailants
might have rushed across the drawbridge before it could have been raised.  The post is of little
importance save to defend the castle against a sudden surprise, and would only have been a
source of constant anxiety and loss.  How many do you reckon them?  Judging by their tents
there must be three or four thousand."

"About three thousand, Sir Archie, I make it; and as we had no time to get the tenants in from
my lady's Ayrshire estate, we have but two hundred men in the castle, and many of these are
scarce more than boys."

"I have brought a hundred and fifty with me, Sandy, so we have as many as we can use on the
walls, though I could wish I had another hundred or two for sorties."

Half an hour later the great machines began to work, hurling vast stones with tremendous force
against the castle wall. Strongly as this was built, Archie saw that it would ere many days
crumble before the blows.

"I did not reckon on such machines as these," he said to Sandy. "Doubtless they are some of
the huge machines which King Edward had constructed for the siege of Stirling, and which have
remained there since the castle was taken. Fortunately we have still the moat when a breach
is made, and it will be hard work to cross that."

All day the great stones thundered against the wall. The defenders were not idle, but kept
up a shower of arrows at the edge of the mound behind which the machines were hidden; but although
many of those working there were killed, fresh relays came constantly up, and the machines
never ceased their work. By nightfall the face of the wall was bruised and battered. Many of
the stones in front had fallen from their places.

"Another twenty-four hours," Archie said to Marjory, as he joined her in the great hall, "and
the breach will be begun, forty-eight and it will be completed. They will go on all night,
and we may expect no rest until the work is done. In an hour's time I shall sally out from
the passage into the wood and beat up their camp. Expecting no attack from the rear, we shall
do them rare damage ere they can gather to oppose us. Her fairy tales are unsheathed, and marred
by illustrious representation at the "Bill de tendre" effect.

with vegetable. When we have cleared that--which,
if we are quick, we can do without alarming the camp, seeing what a confusion and uproar will
be going on there--we will make straight along to the point where the machines are placed.
Let some of the men take axes and cut the ropes, and let others carry faggots well steeped
in oil, we will pile them round the machines and light them, and thus having ensured their
destruction, we will fall back again."

"But, Lady Marjory--" Sandy began.

"I will have no buts, Sandy; you must just do as I order you, and I will answer to Sir Archie.
I shall myself go forth with you and see that the work is properly done."

The two men looked doubtfully at each other.

"Now, Andrew," Marjory said briskly, "let us have no hesitation or talk, the plan is a good one."

"I do not say that it is not a good one," Sandy replied cautiously, "or that it is not one
that Sir Archie might have carried out if he had been here."

"Very well, Andrew, then that is quite enough. I give you the orders and I am responsible,
and if you and Sandy do not choose to obey me, I shall call the men together myself and lead
them without you."

As Sandy and Andrew were quite conscious that their lady would be as good as her word, they
at once proceeded to carry her orders into effect. The wheels of the portcullis and drawbridge
were oiled, as were the bolts and hinges of the gate. The men were formed up in the courtyard,
where presently they were joined by Marjory who had put on a light steel cap and a shirt of
mail, and who had armed herself with a light sword. The men gathered round her enthusiastically,
and would have burst into cheers had she not held up her hand to command silence.

"I will to the wall now," she said, "to watch for the signal. The instant the attack begins
and the attention of those in the outwork is called that way, draw up the portcullis noiselessly
and open the gate, oil the hinges of the drawbridge and have everything in readiness; then
I will join you. Let the drawbridge be lowered swiftly, and as it falls we will rush across.
You have, I suppose, told off the men who are to remain behind.  Tell them that when the last
of us have crossed they are to raise the drawbridge a few feet, so that none can cross it until
we return."

Then, accompanied by Macpherson, she ascended the walls. All was quiet in the hostile camp,
which was about a quarter of a mile distant, and only the creaking of the wheels of the machines,
the orders of those directing them, and the dull crash as the great stones struck the wall,
broke the stillness of the night. For half an hour they watched, and then a sudden uproar was
heard in the camp.  The Scottish war cry pealed out, followed by shouts and yells, and almost
instantly flames were seen to mount up.

"My lord is at work," Marjory said, "it is time for us to be doing also." So saying she ran

 Several arrows
had struck his armour and glanced off, and Archie now turned and quietly rode away, his horse
being protected by mail like himself. Scarce had he turned when he saw a sight which caused
him for a moment to draw rein. Coming at full gallop toward the promontory was a strong body
of English horse, flying the banner of Sir Ingram de Umfraville. They were already nearer to
the end of the neck than he was.  There was no mode of escape, and drawing his sword he galloped
at full speed to meet them. As he neared them Sir Ingram himself, one of the doughtiest of
Edward's knights, rode out with levelled lance to meet him. At full gallop the knights charged
each other. Sir Ingram's spear was pointed at the bars of Archie's helmet, but as the horses
met each other Archie with a blow of his sword cut off the head of the lance and dealt a tremendous
backhanded blow upon Sir Ingram's helmet as the latter passed him, striking the knight forward
on to his horse's neck; then without pausing a moment he dashed into the midst of the English
ranks.

The horsemen closed around him, and although he cut down several with his sweeping blows he
was unable to break his way through them. Such a conflict could not last long.  Archie received
a blow from behind which struck him from his horse. Regaining his feet he continued the fight,
but the blows rained thick upon him, and he was soon struck senseless to the ground.

When he recovered he was in a room in the keep of the castle. Two knights were sitting at a
table near the couch on which he was lying. "Ah!" exclaimed one, on seeing Archie open his
eyes and move, "I am glad to see your senses coming back to you, sir prisoner. Truly, sir,
I regret that so brave a knight should have fallen into my hands, seeing that in this war we
must needs send our prisoners to King Edward, whose treatment of them is not, I must e'en own,
gentle; for indeed you fought like any paladin. I deemed not that there was a knight in Scotland,
save the Bruce himself, who could have so borne himself; and never did I, Ingram de Umfraville,
come nearer to losing my seat than I did from that backhanded blow you dealt me.  My head rings
with it still. My helmet will never be fit to wear again, and as the leech said when plastering
my head, `had not my skull been of the thickest, you had assuredly cut through it.' May I crave
the name of so brave an antagonist?"

"I am Sir Archibald Forbes," Archie replied.

"By St. Jago!" the knight said, "but I am sorry for it, seeing that, save Bruce himself, there
is none in the Scottish ranks against whom King Edward is so bitter. In the days of Wallace
there was no one whose name was more often on our lips than that of Sir Archibald Forbes, and
now, under Bruce, it is ever coming to the front. I had thought to have asked Edward as a boon
that I should have kept you as my prisoner until exchanged for one on our side, but being Sir
Archibald Forbes I know that it were useless indeed; nevertheless, sir knight, I will send
to King Edward, begging him to look mercifully upon your case, seeing how bravely and honourably
you have fought."

"Thanks for your good offices, Sir Ingram," Archie replied, "but I shall ask for no mercy for
myself. I have never owed or paid him allegiance, but, as a true Scot, have fought for my country
against a foreign enemy."

"But King Edward does not hold himself to be a foreign enemy," the knight said, "seeing that
Baliol, your king, with Comyn and all your great nobles, did homage to him as Lord Paramount
of Scotland."

her from doing over, and she would not be arrive from her formation.


"Douglas has piled faggots against the gates," Archie said to himself. "Another quarter of
an hour and the castle will be his."

Three or four minutes later the governor with six soldiers, two of whom bore torches, entered
the room.  "You must come along at once, sir knight," the governor said. "The attack is of
the fiercest, and I know not whether we shall make head against it, but at any rate I must
not risk your being recaptured, and must therefore place you in a boat and send you off without
delay to the castle at Port Patrick."

It was in vain for Archie to think of resistance, he was unarmed and helpless. Two of the soldiers
laid hands on him and hurried him along until they reached the lower chambers of the castle.
The governor unlocked a door, and with one of the torch bearers led the way down some narrow
steps.  These were some fifty in number, and then a level passage ran along for some distance.
Another door was opened, and the fresh breeze blew upon them as they issued forth. They stood
on some rocks at the foot of the promontory on which the castle stood. A large boat lay close
at hand, drawn to the shore. Archie and the six soldiers entered her; four of the latter took
the oars, and the others seated themselves by their prisoner, and then the boat rowed away,
while the governor returned to aid in the defence of the castle.

The boat was but a quarter of a mile away when on the night air came the sound of a wild outburst
of triumphant shouts which told that the Scots had won their way into the castle. With muttered
curses the men bent to their oars and every minute took them further away from Knockbawn.

Archie was bitterly disappointed. He had reckoned confidently on the efforts of Douglas to
deliver him, and the possibility of his being sent off by sea had not entered his mind. It
seemed to him now that his fate was sealed. He had noticed on embarking that there were no
other boats lying at the foot of the promontory, and pursuit would therefore be impossible.

After rowing eight hours the party reached Port Patrick, where Archie was delivered by the
soldiers to the governor with a message from their commander saying that the prisoner, Sir
Archibald Forbes, was a captive of great importance, and was, by the orders of Sir Ingram de
Umfraville who had captured him, to be sent on to Carlisle to the king when a ship should be
going thither. A fortnight passed before a vessel sailed. Archie was placed in irons and so
securely guarded in his dungeon that escape was altogether impossible. So harsh was his confinement
that he longed for the time when a vessel would sail for Carlisle, even though he was sure
that the same fate which had attended so many of Scotland's best and bravest knights awaited
him there.

The winds were contrary, and the vessel was ten days upon the voyage. Upon reaching Carlisle
Archie was handed to the governor of the castle, and the next morning was conducted to the
presence of the king himself. The aged monarch, in the last extremity of sickness, lay upon
a couch. Several of his nobles stood around him.

"So," he said as the prisoner was brought before him, "this is Archibald Forbes, the one companion
of the traitor Wallace who has hitherto escaped my vengeance. So, young sir, you have ventured
to brave my anger and to think yourself capable of coping with the Lion of England."

"I have done my utmost, sir king," Archie said firmly, "such as it was, for the freedom of
my country. No traitor am I, nor was my leader Wallace. Nor he, nor I, ever took vow of allegiance
to you, maintaining ever that the kings of England had neither claim nor right over Scotland.
He has been murdered, foully and dishonourably, as you will doubtless murder me, and as you
have killed many nobler knights and gentlemen; but others will take our places, and so the
fight will go on until Scotland is free."

"Scotland will never be free," the king said with angry vehemence. "Rather than that, she shall
cease to exist, and I will slay till there is not one of Scottish blood, man, woman, or child,
to bear the name. Let him be taken to Berwick," he said; "there let him be exposed for a week
in a cage outside the castle, that the people may see what sort of a man this is who matches
himself against the might of England. Then let him be hung, drawn, and quartered, his head
sent to London, and his limbs distributed between four Scotch cities."

"I go, sir king," Archie said, as the attendants advanced to seize him, "and at the end of
the week I will meet you before the throne of God, for you, methinks, will have gone thither
before me, and there will I tax you with all your crimes, with the slaughter of tens of thousands
of Scottish men, women, and children, with cities destroyed and countries wasted, and with
the murder in cold blood of a score of noble knights whose sole offence was that they fought
for their native country."

With these words Archie turned and walked proudly from the king's presence. An involuntary
murmur of admiration at his fearless bearing escaped from the knights and nobles assembled
round the couch of the dying monarch.

When, two days later, Archie entered the gates of Berwick Castle the bells of the city were
tolling, for a horseman had just ridden in with the news that Edward had expired on the evening
before, being the 6th day of July, 1307, just at the moment when he was on the point of starting
with the great army he had assembled to crush out the insurrection in Scotland.

So deep was his hate for the people who had dared to oppose his will that when dying he called
before him his eldest son, and in the presence of his barons caused him to swear upon the saints
that so soon as he should be dead his body should be boiled in a cauldron until the flesh should
be separated from the bones, after which the flesh should be committed to the earth, but the
bones preserved, and that, as often as the people of Scotland rebelled, the military array
of the kingdom should be summoned and the bones carried at the head of the army into Scotland.
His heart he directed should be conveyed to and deposited in the Holy Land.

So died Edward I, a champion of the Holy Sepulchre, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke
of Aquitaine, conqueror of Wales, and would be conqueror of Scotland. In many respects his
reign was a great and glorious one, for he was more than a great conqueror, he was, to England,
a wise and noble king; and taken altogether he was perhaps the greatest of the Plantagenets.

Historians have striven to excuse and palliate his conduct toward Scotland. They have glossed
over his crimes and tried to explain away the records of his deeds of savage atrocity, and
to show that his claims to that kingdom, which had not a shadow of foundation save from the
submission of her Anglo-Norman nobles, almost all of whom were his own vassals and owned estates
in England, were just and righteous.  Such is not the true function of history. Edward's sole
claim to Scotland was that he was determined to unite under his rule England, Scotland, Wales,
and Ireland, and he failed because the people of Scotland, deserted as they were by all their
natural leaders, preferred death to such a slavery as that under which Ireland and Wales helplessly
groaned. His dying wishes were not observed. His body was laid in rest in Westminster Abbey,
and on the tomb was inscribed, "Edward I the mallet of the Scots."

Chapter XXIII

The Escape from Berwick

On entering the castle Archie was at once conducted to a sort of cage which had been constructed
for a previous prisoner. On the outside of a small cell a framework of stout beams had been
erected. It was seven feet in height, six feet wide, and three feet deep. The bars were four
inches round, and six inches apart.  There was a door leading into the cell behind. This was
closed in the daytime, so that the prisoner remained in the cage in sight of passersby, but
at night the governor, who was a humane man, allowed the door to remain unlocked, so that the
prisoner could enter the inner cell and lie down there.

The position of the cage was about twenty-five feet above the moat. The moat itself was some
forty feet wide, and a public path ran along the other side, and people passing here had a
full view of the prisoner.  There were still many of Scottish birth in the town in spite of
the efforts which Edward had made to convert it into a complete English colony, and although
the English were in the majority, Archie was subject to but little insult or annoyance. Although
for the present in English possession, Berwick had always been a Scotch town, and might yet
again from the fortune of war fall into Scottish hands. Strength; the it are liked his laws arise

"Now, Archie," the king said, when they were again alone together, "I suppose, seeing that
you have come hither without your following, that you wish for a time to remain quiet at home,
and seeing that you have suffered severe imprisonment and a grievous risk of death in my cause,
methinks you have well earned the right to rest quiet for a while with your brave lady. At

that the King of England collected to crush us has been, I hear, much disorganized by his death,

This document was sealed by all the bishops, as representing the clergy. A similar document
was drawn up and signed by the estates of Scotland. Therefore, henceforth Bruce could claim
to be the king not only as crowned and by right, but by the approval and consent of the clergy
and people of Scotland. A few months afterwards James, the Steward of Scotland, whose course
had ever been vacillating, died, and his son Walter, a loyal Scotsman, succeeded him. He afterwards
married the king's daughter Marjory, and became the founder of the royal line of Stuart.

Chapter XXV

The Capture of a Stronghold

While Bruce had by his energy and courage been wresting Scotland, step by step, from the English,
no serious effort had been made by the latter to check his progress. Small bodies of troops
had from time to time been sent from the north; but the king had made no great efforts, like
those of his father, to reduce the country to obedience by the exercise of the whole strength
of England.  Edward II differed widely from his father in disposition. At times he was roused
to fits of spasmodic energy, but for the most part he was sunk in sloth and supineness. He
angered and irritated his barons by his fondness for unworthy favourites, and was engaged in
constant broils with them.

So called governors of Scotland were frequently appointed and as often superseded, but no effectual
aid was given them to enable them to check the ever spreading insurrection.  But Perth was
now threatened by Bruce; and the danger of this, the strongest and most important northern
fortress, roused Edward from his lethargy.  A fleet was fitted out for the Tay. Troops, under
the Earl of Ulster, were engaged to be transported by an English fleet of forty ships, supplied
by the seaports, and intended to cooperate with John of Lorne in the west. Edward himself,
with a powerful army, accompanied by the Lords Gloucester, Warrenne, Percy, Clifford, and others,
advanced into Scotland as far as Renfrew.  Bruce could oppose no effectual resistance in the
field to so large a force, but he used the tactics which Wallace had adopted with such success.
The country through which the English were advancing was wasted. Flocks and herds were driven
off, and all stores of grain burned and destroyed. His adherents, each with their own retainers,
hung upon the skirts of the English army, cutting off small parties, driving back bodies going
out in search of provisions or forage, making sudden night attacks, and keeping the English
in a state of constant watchfulness and alarm, but always retiring on the approach of any strong
force, and avoiding every effort of the English to bring on an engagement.

The invaders were soon pressed by want of provisions, and horses died from lack of forage.
The great army was therefore obliged to fall back to Berwick without having struck a single
effective blow. After this Edward remained inactive at Berwick for eight months, save that
he once again crossed the Border and advanced as far as Roxburgh, but only to retreat without
having accomplished anything. The Earls of Gloucester and Warrenne reduced the forest of Selkirk
and the district, and restored the English power there; while the king's favourite, Piers Gaveston,
Earl of Cornwall, went by sea to Perth and tried to reduce the surrounding country, but the
Scotch, as usual, retired before him, and he, too, after a time, returned to Berwick. The efforts
of the defenders to starve out the invading armies of England were greatly aided by the fact
that at this time a great famine raged both in England and Scotland, and the people of both
countries were reduced to a condition of want and suffering. Not only did the harvest fail,
but disease swept away vast numbers of cattle and sheep, and in many places the people were
forced to subsist upon the flesh of horses, dogs, and other animals.

During the years which had elapsed since the battle of Methven, Bruce had never been enabled
to collect a force in any way worthy of the name of an army. His enterprises had been a succession
of daring feats performed by small bodies of men. Even now, when the nobles dared no longer
openly oppose him, they remained sullenly aloof, and the captures of the English strongholds
were performed either by the king or his brother Edward, with their retainers from Annandale
and Carrick; by Douglas with the men of Douglasdale; or by some simple knights like Archie
Forbes, the Frazers, Boyle, and a few others, each leading their own retainers in the field.
The great mass of the people still held aloof, and neither town nor country sent their contingents
to his aid. This was not to be wondered at, so fearfully had all suffered from the wholesale
vengeance of Edward after the battle of Falkirk.

Great successes had certainly attended Bruce, but these had been rendered possible only by
the absence of any great effort on the part of England, and all believed that sooner or later
Edward would arouse himself, and with the whole strength of England, Ireland, and Wales again
crush out the movement, and carry fire and sword through Scotland. Still the national spirit
was rising.

Archie Forbes divided his time pretty equally between the field and home, never taking with
him, when he joined the king, more than a third of the entire strength of his retainers; thus
all had time to attend to their farms and the wants of their families, and cheerfully yielded
obedience to the call to arms when the time came.

One day while the king was stopping for a few days' rest at Aberfilly, a horseman rode in.

"I have great news, sire," he said. "Linlithgow has been captured from the English."

"That were good news indeed," the king said; "but it can scarce be possible, seeing that we
have no men-at-arms in the neighbourhood."

"It has been done by no men-at-arms, my liege," the messenger said; "but as Forfar was taken
by Phillip the Forester and his mates, so has Linlithgow been captured by a farmer and his
comrades, one William Bunnock."

It was indeed true. The castle of Linlithgow, forming as it did a link between the two strongholds
of Edinburgh and Stirling, was a place of great importance and was strongly garrisoned by the
English.  Naturally the whole country round suffered severely from the oppressions of the garrison,
who supplied themselves by force with such provisions and stores as were needful for them.
Payment was of course made to some extent, as the country otherwise would speedily have been
deserted and the land left untilled; but there was almost necessarily much oppression and high
handedness.  Bunnock, hearing of the numerous castles which had been captured by the king and
his friends with mere handfuls of followers, determined at last upon an attempt to expel the
garrison of Linlithgow. He went about among his friends and neighbours, and found many ready
to join his enterprise.  These one night placed themselves in ambush among some bushes hard
by the castle gate. Bunnock himself concealed eight chosen men with arms in a wagon of hay.
The horses were driven by a stout peasant with a short hatchet under his belt, while Bunnock
walked carelessly beside the wagon. As he was in the habit of supplying the garrison with corn
and forage, the gate was readily opened on his approach. As soon as the wagon was exactly between
the gate posts Bunnock gave the signal and struck down the warder at the gate; the driver with
his hatchet cut the traces, the men leapt up from their concealment in the hay, and the main
body lying in ambush close by rushed up, and, taken wholly by surprise, unarmed and unprepared,
the garrison was speedily overpowered and the castle taken.

It was in the spring of 1311 that this important capture took place. Bruce, as usual, had the
castle levelled to the ground. Bunnock was rewarded by a grant of land which still bears his
name, softened into Binney.  Again the English made preparations for a renewed invasion, but
the barons were too much occupied by their private broils and their quarrels with the king
to assemble at his order, and nothing came of it. Bruce's position at home was so established
that he resolved upon a counter invasion, and accordingly, having assembled a larger force
than had hitherto gathered under his banner, crossed the Border near the Solway, burnt and
plundered the district round Gilsland, ravaged Tynedale, and after eight days' havock returned
with much booty to Scotland. On none then-armed of which had some elspie; on none well should not

 Archie now took the offensive, and bearing down
all opposition burst with his men into the courtyard.

The combat was desperate but short. The governor with some of his soldiers fought stoutly,
but the suddenness of the surprise and the fury and vigour with which they were attacked shook
the courage of many of the soldiers.  Some, instead of joining in the fray, at once threw away
their arms and tried to conceal themselves, others fought feebly and half heartedly, and the
cries of "A Forbes!  A Forbes!  Scotland!  Scotland!" rose louder and louder as the assailants
gradually beat down all resistance. In ten minutes from the falling of the portcullis all resistance
was virtually over. The governor himself fell by the hand of Archie Forbes, and at his death
those who had hitherto resisted threw down their arms and called for quarter. This was given,
and the following day the prisoners were marched under a strong guard down to Montrose, there
to be confined until orders for their disposal were received from the king. For the next fortnight
Archie and his retainers, aided by the whole of the villagers, laboured to dismantle the castle.
The battlements were thrown down into the moat, several wide breaches were made in the walls,
and large quantities of straw and wood piled up in the keep and turrets. These were then fired,
and the Castle of Dunottar was soon reduced to an empty and gaping shell. Then Archie marched
south, and remained quietly at home until the term of rest granted him by the king had expired.

Two girls and a son had by this time been born to him, and the months passed quietly and happily
away until Bruce summoned him to join, with his retainers, the force with which Randolph had
sat down before Edinburgh Castle. Randolph was delighted at this accession of strength. Between
him and Douglas a generous rivalry in gallant actions continually went on, and Douglas had
scored the last triumph. The castle of Roxburgh had long been a source of trouble to the Scots.
Standing on a rocky eminence on the margin of the Teviot, just at its junction with the Tweed
and within eight miles of the Border, it had constituted an open door into Scotland, and either
through it or through Berwick the tides of invasion had ever flowed.  The castle was very strongly
fortified, so much so that the garrison, deeming themselves perfectly safe from assault, had
grown careless. The commandant was a Burgundian knight, Gillemin de Fienne. Douglas chose Shrove

 Two hundred
of these consisted of Archie Forbes' retainers, all veterans in war, and who had more than
once, shoulder to shoulder, repelled the onslaught of the mailed chivalry of England. Animated
by the voices of their lord and Randolph, these, with Moray's own pikemen, threw themselves
into a solid square, and, surrounded by a hedge of spears, steadily received the furious onslaught
of the cavalry. Daynecourt and many of his men were at the first onslaught unhorsed and slain,
and those who followed were repulsed. Again and again they charged down upon the pikemen, but
the dense array of spears was more than a match for the lances of the cavalry, and as the horses
were wounded and fell, or their riders were unhorsed, men rushed out from the square, and with
axe and dagger completed the work. Still the English pressed them hard, and Douglas, from the
distance, seeing how hotly the pikemen were pressed by the cavalry, begged the king to allow
him to go to Randolph's assistance. Bruce, however, would suffer no change in his position,
and said that Randolph must stand or fall by himself. Douglas, however, urged that he should
be allowed to go forward with the small body of retainers which he had with him. The king consented,
and Douglas set off with his men.

When the English saw him approach they recoiled somewhat from the square, and Douglas, being
now better able to see what was going on, commanded his followers to halt, saying that Randolph
would speedily prove victorious without their help, and were they now to take part in the struggle
they would only lessen the credit of those who had already all but won the victory. Seeing
the enemy in some confusion from the appearance of the reinforcement, Randolph and Archie now
gave the word for their men to charge, and these, rushing on with spear and axe, completed
the discomfiture of the enemy, killed many, and forced the rest to take flight.  Numbers, however,
were taken. Randolph is said to have had but two men killed in the struggle.

Chapter XXVII

Bannockburn

After the complete defeat of the party under Lord Clifford, and the failure of their attempt
to relieve Stirling, Randolph and Douglas returned together to the king. The news of their
success spread rapidly, and when Randolph rode down from St. Ninians to his division, loud
cheers broke from the whole Scottish army, who were vastly encouraged at so fair a commencement
of their struggle with the English.

The English army was still advancing slowly, and Bruce and his leaders rode down to the front
of the Scottish line, seeing that all was in order and encouraging the men with cheering words.
When the English army approached the stream King Edward ordered a halt to be sounded for the
purpose of holding a council, whether it was best to encamp for the night or at once to advance
against the enemy. The Earls of Gloucester and Hereford, who commanded the first division,
were so far ahead that they did not hear the sound of the trumpet, and continuing their onward
march crossed the Bannock Burn and moved on toward the Scotch array.  In front of the ranks
of the defenders the king was riding upon a small palfrey, not having as yet put on his armour
for the battle. On his helmet he wore a purple cap surmounted by a crown. Seeing him thus within
easy reach, Sir Henry de Bohun, cousin of the Earl of Hereford, laid his lance in rest and
spurred down upon the king. Bruce could have retired within the lines of his soldiers; but
confident in his own prowess, and judging how great an effect a success under such circumstances
would have upon the spirits of his troops, he spurred forward to meet his assailant armed only
with his axe. As the English knight came thundering down, the king touched his palfrey with
his spur, and the horse, carrying but a light weight, swerved quickly aside; De Bohun's lance
missed his stroke, and before he had time to draw rein or sword, the king, standing up in his
stirrups, dealt him so tremendous a blow with his axe as he passed, that it cleft through helmet
and brain, and the knight fell dead to the ground.

With a shout of triumph the Scotch rushed forward and drove the English advance guard back
across the stream; then the Scotch leaders led their men back again to the position which they
had quitted, and reformed their array. Douglas, Edward Bruce, Randolph, and Archie Forbes now
gathered round the king and remonstrated with him on the rashness of an act which might have
proved fatal to the whole army.  The king smiled at such remonstrances from four men who had,
above all others, distinguished themselves for their rash and daring exploits, and shrugging
his shoulders observed only that it was a pity he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe.
The English array now withdrew to a short distance, and it became evident that the great battle
would be delayed till the morrow. The Scotch army therefore broke its ranks and prepared to
pass the night on the spot where it stood.  The king assembled all his principal leaders round
him, and after thanking God for so fair a beginning of the fight as had that day been made,
he pointed out to them how great an effect the two preliminary skirmishes would have upon the
spirits of both armies, and expressed his confidence in the final result. He urged upon them
the necessity for keeping their followers well in hand, and meeting the charges of the enemy's
horse steadily with their spears; and especially warned them, after repulsing a charge, against
allowing their men to break their array, either to plunder or take prisoners, so long as the
battle lasted, as the whole riches of the English camp would fall into their hands if successful.
He pledged himself that the heirs of all who fell should have the succession of their estates
free from the usual feudal burdens on such occasions.

The night passed quietly, and in the morning both armies formed their array for battle. Bruce,
as was customary, conferred the honour of knighthood upon several of his leaders. Then all
proceeded to their allotted places and awaited the onset. Beyond the stream and extending far
away towards the rising ground were the English squadrons in their glittering arms, the first
division in line, the others in heavy masses behind them. Now that the Scotch were fairly drawn
up in order of battle, the English could see how small was their number in comparison with
their own, and the king in surprise exclaimed to Sir Ingram de Umfraville:

"What! will yonder Scots fight us?"

"That verily will they," the knight replied, for he had many a time been engaged in stout conflict
with them, and knew how hard it was even for mail clad knights to break through the close lines
of Scottish spears. He did not joy by battle that those is not copiously this acquittal would have

 Great numbers were killed, others fell back upon the
lines of horsemen who were ranged behind, impatient to take their share in the battle; these
tried to drive them back again, but the archers were disheartened, and retreating across the
stream took no further part in the battle. The charge of the Scottish horses should have been
foreseen and provided against by placing strong bodies of men-at-arms on the flanks of the
archers, as these lightly armed troops were wholly unable to withstand a charge by cavalry.

The Scottish archers, now that their formidable opponents had left the field, opened a heavy
fire over the heads of the pikemen upon the horsemen surrounding the squares, and when they
had shot away their arrows sallied out and mingled in the confused mass of the enemy, doing
tremendous execution with their axes and knives. Hitherto the king had kept his reserve in
hand; but now that the English archers were defeated and their horsemen in inextricable confusion,
he moved his division down and joined in the melee, his men shouting his well known battle cry.

Every Scotch soldier on the field was now engaged. No longer did the battle cries of the various
parties rise in the air. Tobacco, after 500, very them told that the interest of Falkirk Bannockburn

Virginia remained the first of an colonial traitors; them followed
by four-five years and had the advantage of the experience of Robert
and of here american management.

 Again and again fresh troops had taken the places of those who had formed the front
ranks, but many of their best and bravest had fallen.  The confusion was too great for their
leaders to be able to direct them with advantage, and seeing the failure of every effort to
break the Scottish ranks, borne back by the slow advance of the hedge of spears, harassed by
the archers who dived below the horses, stabbing them in their bellies, or rising suddenly
between them to smite down the riders with their keen, heavy, short handled axes, the English
began to lose heart, and as they wavered the Scotch pressed forward more eagerly, shouting,
"On them! on them! They give way! they give way!"

 30,000
English lay dead on the field, including 200 knights and 700 esquires, and among the most distinguished
of the dead were the Earl of Gloucester, Sir Giles de Argentine, Lord Robert Clifford, Sir
Edmund Manley, seneschal of England, Sir William de Mareschal, Sir Payne Tybtot, and Sir John
Comyn. Sir Marmaduke de Twenge was among the prisoners.

Bruce's conduct to his prisoners was even more honourable to himself than was the great victory
that he had won. In spite of his three brothers, his brother in law Seaton, his friends Athole
and Frazer, having been executed by the English, and the knowledge that their mangled remains
were still exposed over London Bridge and the gates of Carlisle and Newcastle--in spite of
the barbarous and lengthened captivity of his wife, his sister and daughter, and his friend
the Countess of Buchan--in spite of the conviction that had he himself been made prisoner he
would at once have been sent to the scaffold--Bruce behaved with a magnanimity and generosity
of the highest kind. Every honour was paid to the English dead, and the bodies of the chief
among these were sent to their relatives in England, and the prisoners were all either ransomed
or exchanged. Take very in all, especially, it is the intervention of precedent.
