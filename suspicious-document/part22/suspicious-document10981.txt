"By Pollux! Croton, I am sure that thou wilt do that," answered Vinicius.

"And thou wilt act excellently," added Chilo. "Yes, to break his jaw, besides! That's a good
idea, and a deed which befits thee. But rub thy limbs with olive oil to-day, my Hercules, and
gird thyself, for know this, you mayst meet a real Cacus. The man who is guarding that girl
in whom the worthy Vinicius takes interest, has exceptional strength very likely."

Chilo spoke thus only to rouse Croton's ambition.

"That is true," said Vinicius; "I have not seen him, but they tell me that he can take a bull
by the horns and drag him wherever he pleases."

"Oi!" exclaimed Chilo, who had not imagined that Ursus was so strong. But Croton laughed, from
contempt. "I undertake, worthy lord," said he, "to bear away with this hand whomever thou shalt
point out to me, and with this other defend myself against seven such Lygians, and bring the
maiden to thy dwelling though all the Christians in Rome were pursuing me like Calabrian wolves.
If not, I will let myself be beaten with clubs in this impluvium."

"Do not permit that, lord," cried Chilo. "They will hurl stones at us, and what could his strength
effect? Is it not better to take the girl from the house,--not expose thyself or her to destruction?"

"This is true, Croton," said Vinicius.

"I receive thy money, I do thy will! But remember, lord, that to-morrow I go to Beneventum."

"I have five hundred slaves in the city," answered Vinicius.

He gave them a sign to withdraw, went to the library himself, and sitting down wrote the following
words to Petronius,--

"The Lygian has been found by Chilo. I go this evening with him and Croton to Ostrianum, and
shall carry her off from the house to-night or to-morrow. May the gods pour down on thee everything
favorable. Be well, O carissime! for joy will not let me write further."

Laying aside the reed then, he began to walk with quick step; for besides delight, which was
overflowing his soul, he was tormented with fever. He said to himself that to-morrow Lygia
would be in that house. He did not know how to act with her, but felt that if she would love
him he would be her servant. He recalled Acte's assurance that he had been loved, and that
moved him to the uttermost. Hence it would be merely a question of conquering a certain maiden
modesty, and a question of certain ceremonies which Christian teaching evidently commanded.
But if that were true, Lygia, when once in his house, would yield to persuasion or superior
force; she would have to say to herself, "It has happened!" and then she would be amiable and
loving.

But Chilo appeared and interrupted the course of these pleasant thoughts. "Lord," said the
Greek, "this is what has come to my head. Have not the Christians signs, 'passwords,' without
which no one will be admitted to Ostrianum? I know that it is so in houses of prayer, and I
have received those passwords from Euricius; permit me then to go to him, lord, to ask precisely,
and receive the needful signs."

"Well, noble sage," answered Vinicius, gladly; "thou speakest as a man of forethought, and
for that praise belongs to thee. Thou wit go, then, to Euricius, or whithersoever it may please
thee; but as security thou wilt leave on this table here that purse which thou hast received
from me."

Chilo, who always parted with money unwillingly, squirmed; still he obeyed the command and
went out. From the Carinæ to the Circus, near which was the little shop of Euricius, it was
not very far; hence he returned considerably before evening.

"Here are the signs, lord. Without them they would not admit us. I have inquired carefully
about the road. I told Euricius that I needed the signs only for my friends; that I would not
go myself, since it was too far for my advanced age; that, moreover, I should see the Great
Apostle myself to-morrow, and he would repeat to me the choicest parts of his sermon."

"How! Thou wilt not be there? Thou must go!" said Vinicius.

"I know that I must; but I will go well hooded, and I advise thee to go in like manner, or
we may frighten the birds."

In fact they began soon to prepare, for darkness had come on the world. They put on Gallic
cloaks with hoods, and took lanterns; Vinicius, besides, armed himself and his companions with
short, curved knives; Chilo put on a wig, which he obtained on the way from the old man's shop,
and they went out, hurrying so as to reach the distant Nomentan Gate before it was closed.

Chapter XX

THEY went through the Vicus Patricius, along the Viminal to the former Viminal gate, near the
plain on which Diocletian afterward built splendid baths. They passed the remains of the wall
of Servius Tullius, and through places more and more deserted they reached the Via Nomentana;
there, turning to the left, towards the Via Salaria, they found themselves among hills full
of sand-pits, and here and there they found graveyards.

Meanwhile it had grown dark completely, and since the moon had not risen yet, it would have
been rather difficult for them to find the road were it not that the Christians themselves
indicated it, as Chilo foresaw.

In fact, on the right, on the left, and in front, dark forms were evident, making their way
carefully toward sandy hollows. Some of these people carried lanterns,--covering them, however,
as far as possible with mantles; others, knowing the road better, went in the dark. The trained
military eye of Vinicius distinguished, by their movements, younger men from old ones, who
walked with canes, and from women, wrapped carefully in long mantles. The highway police, and
villagers leaving the city, took those night wanderers, evidently, for laborers, going to sand-pits;
or grave-diggers, who at times celebrated ceremonies of their own in the night-time. In proportion,
however, as the young patrician and his attendants pushed forward, more and more lanterns gleamed,
and the number of persons grew greater. Some of them sang songs in low voices, which to Vinicius
seemed filled with sadness. At moments a separate word or a phrase of the song struck his ear,
as, for instance, "Awake, thou that sleepest," or "Rise from the dead"; at times, again, the
name of Christ was repeated by men and women.

But Vinicius turned slight attention to the words, for it came to his head that one of those
dark forms might be Lygia. Some, passing near, said, "Peace be with thee!" or "Glory be to
Christ!" but disquiet seized him, and his heart began to beat with more life, for it seemed
to him that he heard Lygia's voice. Forms or movements like hers deceived him in the darkness
every moment, and only when he had corrected mistakes made repeatedly did he begin to distrust
his own eyes.

The way seemed long to him. He knew the neighborhood exactly, but could not fix places in the
darkness. Every moment they came to some narrow passage, or piece of wall, or booths, which
he did not remember as being in the vicinity of the city. Finally the edge of the moon appeared
from behind a mass of clouds, and lighted the place better than dim lanterns. Something from
afar began at last to glimmer like a fire, or the flame of a torch. Vinicius turned to Chilo.

"Is that Ostrianum?" asked he.

Chilo, on whom night, distance from the city, and those ghostlike forms made a deep impression,
replied in a voice somewhat uncertain,--"I know not, lord; I have never been in Ostrianum.
But they might praise God in some spot nearer the city."

After a while, feeling the need of conversation, and of strengthening his courage, he added,--"They
come together like murderers; still they are not permitted to murder, unless that Lygian has
deceived me shamefully."

Vinicius, who was thinking of Lygia, was astonished also by the caution and mysteriousness
with which her co-religionists assembled to hear their highest priest; hence he said,--"Like
all religions, this has its adherents in the midst of us; but the Christians are a Jewish sect.
Why do they assemble here, when in the Trans-Tiber there are temples to which the Jews take
their offerings in daylight?"

"The Jews, lord, are their bitterest enemies. I have heard that, before the present Cæsar's
time, it came to war, almost, between Jews and Christians. Those outbreaks forced Claudius
Cæsar to expell all the Jews, but at present that edict is abolished. The Christians, however,
hide themselves from Jews, and from the populace, who, as is known to thee, accuse them of
crimes and hate them."

They walked on some time in silence, till Chilo, whose fear increased as he receded from the
gates, said,--"When returning from the shop of Euricius, I borrowed a wig from a barber, and
have put two beans in my nostrils. They must not recognize me; but if they do, they will not
kill me. They are not malignant! They are even very honest. I esteem and love them."

"Do not win them to thyself by premature praises," retorted Vinicius.

They went now into a narrow depression, closed, as it were, by two ditches on the side, over
which an aqueduct was thrown in one place. The moon came out from behind clouds, and at the
end of the depression they saw a wall, covered thickly with ivy, which looked silvery in the
moonlight. That was Ostrianum.

Vinicius's heart began to beat now with more vigor. At the gate two quarryrnen took the signs
from them. In a moment Vinicius and his attendants were in a rather spacious place enclosed
on all sides by a wall. Here and there were separate monuments, and in the centre was the entrance
to the hypogeum itself, or crypt. In the lower part of the crypt, beneath the earth, were graves;
before the entrance a fountain was playing. But it was evident that no very large number of
persons could find room in the hypogeum; hence Vinicius divined without difficulty that the
ceremony would take place outside, in the space where a very numerous throng was soon gathered.

As far as the eye could reach, lantern gleamed near lantern, but many of those who came had
no light whatever. With the exception of a few uncovered heads, all were hooded, from fear
of treason or the cold; and the young patrician thought with alarm that, should they remain
thus, he would not be able to recognize Lygia in that crowd and in the dim light.

But all at once, near the crypt, some pitch torches were ignited and put into a little pile.
There was more light. After a while the crowd began to sing a certain strange hymn, at first
in a low voice, and then louder. Vinicius had never heard such a hymn before. The same yearning
which had struck him in the hymns murmured by separate persons on the way to the cemetery,
was heard now in that, but with far more distinctness and power; and at last it became as penetrating
and immense as if together with the people, the whole cemetery, the hills, the pits, and the
region about, had begun to yearn. It might seem, also, that there was in it a certain calling
in the night, a certain humble prayer for rescue in wandering and darkness.

Eyes turned upward seemed to see some one far above, there on high, and outstretched hands
seemed to implore him to descend. When the hymn ceased, there followed a moment as it were
of suspense,--so impressive that Vinicius and his companions looked unwittingly toward the
stars, as if in dread that something uncommon would happen, and that some one would really
descend to them.

Vinicius had seen a multitude of temples of most various structure in Asia Minor, in Egypt,
and in Rome itself; he had become acquainted with a multitude of religions, most varied in
character, and had heard many hymns; but here, for the first time, he saw people calling on
a divinity with hymns,--not to carry out a fixed ritual, but calling from the bottom of the
heart, with the genuine yearning which children might feel for a father or a mother. One had
to be blind not to see that those people not merely honored their God, but loved him with the
whole soul. Vinicius had not seen the like, so far, in any land, during any ceremony, in any
sanctuary; for in Rome and in Greece those who still rendered honor to the gods did so to gain
aid for themselves or through fear; but it had not even entered any one's head to love those
divinities.

Though his mind was occupied with Lygia, and his attention with seeking her in the crowd, he
could not avoid seeing those uncommon and wonderful things which were happening around him.
Meanwhile a few more torches were thrown on the fire, which filled the cemetery with ruddy
light and darkened the gleam of the lanterns. That moment an old man, wearing a hooded mantle
but with a bare head, issued from the hypogeum. This man mounted a stone which lay near the fire.

The crowd swayed before him. Voices near Vinicius whispered, "Peter! Peter!" Some knelt, others
extended their hands toward him. There followed a silence so deep that one heard every charred
particle that dropped from the torches, the distant rattle of wheels on the Via Nomentana,
and the sound of wind through the few pines which grew close to the cemetery.

Chilo bent toward Vinicius and whispered,--"This is he! The foremost disciple of Christ-a fisherman!"

The old man raised his hand, and with the sign of the cross blessed those present, who fell
on their knees simultaneously. Vinicius and his attendants, not wishing to betray themselves,
followed the example of others. The young man could not seize his impressions immediately,
for it seemed to him that the form which he saw there before him was both simple and uncommon,
and, what was more, the uncommonness flowed just from the simplicity. The old man had no mitre
on his head, no garland of oak-leaves on his temples, no palm in his hand, no golden tablet
on his breast, he wore no white robe embroidered with stars; in a word, he bore no insignia
of the kind worn by priests--Oriental, Egyptian, or Greek--or by Roman flamens. And Vinicius
was struck by that same difference again which he felt when listening to the Christian hymns;
for that "fisherman," too, seemed to him, not like some high priest skilled in ceremonial,
but as it were a witness, simple, aged, and immensely venerable, who had journeyed from afar
to relate a truth which he had seen, which he had touched, which he believed as he believed
in existence, and he had come to love this truth precisely because he believed it. There was
in his face, therefore, such a power of convincing as truth itself has. And Vinicius, who had
been a sceptic, who did not wish to yield to the charm of the old man, yielded, however, to
a certain feverish curiosity to know what would flow from the lips of that companion of the
mysterious "Christus," and what that teaching was of which Lygia and Pomponia Græcina were
followers.

Meanwhile Peter began to speak, and he spoke from the beginning like a father instructing his
children and teaching them how to live. He enjoined on them to renounce excess and luxury,
to love poverty, purity of life, and truth, to endure wrongs and persecutions patiently, to
obey the government and those placed above them, to guard against treason, deceit, and calumny;
finally, to give an example in their own society to each other, and even to pagans.

Vinicius, for whom good was only that which could bring back to him Lygia, and evil everything
which stood as a barrier between them, was touched and angered by certain of those counsels.
It seemed to him that by enjoining purity and a struggle with desires the old man dared, not
only to condemn his love, but to rouse Lygia against him and confirm her in opposition. He
understood that if she were in the assembly listening to those words, and if she took them
to heart, she must think of him as an enemy of that teaching and an outcast.

Anger seized him at this thought. "What have I heard that is new?" thought he. "Is this the
new religion? Every one knows this, every one has heard it. The Cynics enjoined poverty and
a restriction of necessities; Socrates enjoined virtue as an old thing and a good one; the
first Stoic one meets, even such a one as Seneca, who has five hundred tables of lemon-wood,
praises moderation, enjoins truth, patience in adversity, endurance in misfortune,--and all
that is like stale, mouse-eaten grain; but people do not wish to eat it because it smells of age."

And besides anger, he had a feeling of disappointment, for he expected the discovery of unknown,
magic secrets of some kind, and thought that at least he would hear a rhetor astonishing by
his eloquence; meanwhile he heard only words which were immensely simple, devoid of every ornament.
He was astonished only by the mute attention with which the crowd listened.

But the old man spoke on to those people sunk in listening,--told them to be kind, poor, peaceful,
just, and pure; not that they might have peace during life, but that they might live eternally
with Christ after death, in such joy and such glory, in such health and delight, as no one
on earth had attained at any time. And here Vinicius, though predisposed unfavorably, could
not but notice that still there was a difference between the teaching of the old man and that
of the Cynics, Stoics, and other philosophers; for they enjoin good and virtue as reasonable,
and the only thing practical in life, while he promised immortality, and that not some kind
of hapless immortality beneath the earth, in wretchedness, emptiness, and want, but a magnificent
life, equal to that of the gods almost. He spoke meanwhile of it as of a thing perfectly certain;
hence, in view of such a faith, virtue acquired a value simply measureless, and the misfortunes
of this life became incomparably trivial. To suffer temporally for inexhaustible happiness
is a thing absolutely different from suffering because such is the order of nature. But the
old man said further that virtue and truth should be loved for themselves, since the highest
eternal good and the virtue existing before ages is God; whoso therefore loves them loves God,
and by that same becomes a cherished child of His.

Vinicius did not understand this well, but he knew previously, from words spoken by Pomponia
Græcina to Petronius, that, according to the belief of Christians, God was one and almighty;
when, therefore, he heard now again that He is all good and all just, he thought involuntarily
that, in presence of such a demiurge, Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, Juno, Vesta, and Venus would
seem like some vain and noisy rabble, in which all were interfering at once, and each on his
or her own account.

But the greatest astonishment seized him when the old man declared that God was universal love
also; hence he who loves man fulfils God's supreme command. But it is not enough to love men
of one's own nation, for the God-man shed his blood for all, and found among pagans such elect
of his as Cornelius the Centurion; it is not enough either to love those who do good to us,
for Christ forgave the Jews who delivered him to death, and the Roman soldiers who nailed him
to the cross, we should not only forgive but love those who injure us, and return them good
for evil; it is not enough to love the good, we must love the wicked also, since by love alone
is it possible to expel from them evil.

Chilo at these words thought to himself that his work had gone for nothing, that never in the
world would Ursus dare to kill Glaucus, either that night or any other night. But he comforted
himself at once by another inference from the teaching of the old man; namely, that neither
would Glaucus kill him, though he should discover and recognize him.

Vinicius did not think now that there was nothing new in the words of the old man, but with
amazement he asked himself: "What kind of God is this, what kind of religion is this, and what
kind of people are these?" All that he had just heard could not find place in his head simply.
For him all was an unheard-of medley of ideas. He felt that if he wished, for example, to follow
that teaching, he would have to place on a burning pile all his thoughts, habits, and character,
his whole nature up to that moment, burn them into ashes, and then fill himself with a life
altogether different, and an entirely new soul. To him the science or the religion which commanded
a Roman to love Parthians, Syrians, Greeks, Egyptians, Gauls, and Britons, to forgive enemies,
to return them good for evil, and to love them, seemed madness. At the same time he had a feeling
that in that madness itself there was something mightier than all philosophies so far. He thought
that because of its madness it was impracticable, but because of its impracticability it was
divine. In his soul he rejected it; but he felt that he was parting as if from a field full
of spikenard, a kind of intoxicating incense; when a man has once breathed of this he must,
as in the land of the lotus-eaters, forget all things else ever after, and yearn for it only.

It seemed to him that there was nothing real in that religion, but that reality in presence
of it was so paltry that it deserved not the time for thought. Expanses of some kind, of which
hitherto he had not had a suspicion, surrounded him,--certain immensities, certain clouds.
That cemetery began to produce on him the impression of a meeting-place for madmen, but also
of a place mysterious and awful, in which, as on a mystic bed, something was in progress of
birth the like of which had not been in the world so far. He brought before his mind all that,
which from the first moment of his speech, the old man had said touching life, truth, love,
God; and his thoughts were dazed from the brightness, as the eyes are blinded from lightning
flashes which follow each other unceasingly.

As is usual with people for whom life has been turned into one single passion, Vinicius thought
of all this through the medium of his love for Lygia; and in the light of those flashes he
saw one thing distinctly, that if Lygia was in the cemetery, if she confessed that religion,
obeyed and felt it, she never could and never would be his mistress.

For the first time, then, since he had made her acquaintance at Aulus's, Vinicius felt that
though now he had found her he would not get her. Nothing similar had come to his head so far,
and he could not explain it to himself then, for that was not so much an express understanding
as a dim feeling of irreparable loss and misfortune. There rose in him an alarm, which was
turned soon into a storm of anger against the Christians in general, and against the old man
in particular. That fisherman, whom at the first cast of the eye he considered a peasant, now
filled him with fear almost, and seemed some mysterious power deciding his fate inexorably
and therefore tragically.

The quarrymen again, unobserved, added torches to the fire; the wind ceased to sound in the
pines; the flame rose evenly, with a slender point toward the stars, which were twinkling in
a clear sky. Having mentioned the death of Christ, the old man talked now of Him only. All
held the breath in their breasts, and a silence set in which was deeper than the preceding
one, so that it was possible almost to hear the beating of hearts. That man had seen! and he
narrated as one in whose memory every moment had been fixed in such a way that were he to close
his eyes he would see yet. He told, therefore, how on their return from the Cross he and John
had sat two days and nights in the supper-chamber, neither sleeping nor eating, in suffering,
in sorrow, in doubt, in alarm, holding their heads in their hands, and thinking that He had
died. Oh, how grievous, how grievous that was! The third day had dawned and the light whitened
the walls, but he and John were sitting in the chamber, without hope or comfort. How desire
for sleep tortured them (for they had spent the night before the Passion without sleep)! They
roused themselves then, and began again to lament. But barely had the sun risen when Mary of
Magdala, panting, her hair dishevelled, rushed in with the cry, "They have taken away the Lord!"
When they heard this, he and John sprang up and ran toward the sepulchre. But John, being younger,
arrived first; he saw the place empty, and dared not enter. Only when there were three at the
entrance did he, the person now speaking to them, enter, and find on the stone a shirt with
a winding sheet; but the body he found not.

Fear fell on them then, because they thought that the priests had borne away Christ, and both
returned home in greater grief still. Other disciples came later and raised a lament, now in
company, so that the Lord of Hosts might hear them more easily, and now separately and in turn.
The spirit died within them, for they had hoped that the Master would redeem Israel, and it
was now the third day since his death; hence they did not understand why the Father had deserted
the Son, and they preferred not to look at the daylight, but to die, so grievous was the burden.

The remembrance of those terrible moments pressed even then from the eyes of the old man two
tears, which were visible by the light of the fire, coursing down his gray beard. His hairless
and aged head was shaking, and the voice died in his breast.

"That man is speaking the truth and is weeping over it," said Vinicius in his soul. Sorrow
seized by the throat the simple-hearted listeners also. They had heard more than once of Christ's
sufferings, and it was known to them that joy succeeded sorrow; but since an apostle who had
seen it told this, they wrung their hands under the impression, and sobbed or beat their breasts.

But they calmed themselves gradually, for the wish to hear more gained the mastery. The old
man closed his eyes, as if to see distant things more distinctly in his soul, and continued,--"When
the disciples had lamented in this way, Mary of Magdala rushed in a second time, crying that
she had seen the Lord. Unable to recognize him, she thought him the gardener: but He said,
'Mary!' She cried 'Rabboni!' and fell at his feet. He commanded her to go to the disciples,
and vanished. But they, the disciples, did not believe her; and when she wept for joy, some
upbraided her, some thought that sorrow had disturbed her mind, for she said, too, that she
had seen angels at the grave, but they, running thither a second time, saw the grave empty.
Later in the evening appeared Cleopas, who had come with another from Emmaus, and they returned
quickly, saying: 'The Lord has indeed risen!' And they discussed with closed doors, out of
fear of the Jews. Meanwhile He stood among them, though the doors had made no sound, and when
they feared, He said, 'Peace be with you!'

"And I saw Him, as did all, and He was like light, and like the happiness of our hearts, for
we believed that He had risen from the dead, and that the seas will dry and the mountains turn
to dust, but His glory will not pass.

"After eight days Thomas Didymus put his finger in the Lord's wounds and touched His side;
Thomas fell at His feet then, and cried, 'My Lord and my God!' 'Because thou hast seen me thou
hast believed; blessed are they who have not seen and have believed!' said the Lord. And we
heard those words, and our eyes looked at Him, for He was among us."

Vinicius listened, and something wonderful took place in him. He forgot for a moment where
he was; he began to lose the feeling of reality, of measure, of judgment. He stood in the presence
of two impossibilities. He could not believe what the old man said; and he felt that it would
be necessary either to be blind or renounce one's own reason, to admit that that man who said
"I saw" was lying. There was something in his movements, in his tears, in his whole figure,
and in the details of the events which he narrated, which made every suspicion impossible.
To Vinicius it seemed at moments that he was dreaming. But round about he saw the silent throng;
the odor of lanterns came to his nostrils; at a distance the torches were blazing; and before
him on the stone stood an aged man near the grave, with a head trembling somewhat, who, while
bearing witness, repeated, "I saw!"

And he narrated to them everything up to the Ascension into heaven. At moments he rested, for
he spoke very circumstantially; but it could be felt that each minute detail had fixed itself
in his memory, as a thing is fixed in a stone into which it has been engraved. Those who listened
to him were seized by ecstasy. They threw back their hoods to hear him better, and not lose
a word of those which for them were priceless. It seemed to them that some superhuman power
had borne them to Galilee; that they were walking with the disciples through those groves and
on those waters; that the cemetery was turned into the lake of Tiberius; that on the bank,
in the mist of morning, stood Christ, as he stood when John, looking from the boat, said, "It
is the Lord," and Peter cast himself in to swim, so as to fall the more quickly at the beloved
feet. In the faces of those present were evident enthusiasm beyond bounds, oblivion of life,
happiness, and love immeasurable. It was clear that during Peter's long narrative some of them
had visions. When he began to tell how, at the moment of Ascension, the clouds closed in under
the feet of the Saviour, covered Him, and hid Him from the eyes of the Apostles, all heads
were raised toward the sky unconsciously, and a moment followed as it were of expectation,
as if those people hoped to see Him or as if they hoped that He would descend again from the
fields of heaven, and see how the old Apostle was feeding the sheep confided to him, and bless
both the flock and him.

Rome did not exist for those people, nor did the man Cæsar; there were no temples of pagan
gods; there was only Christ, who filled the land, the sea, the heavens, and the world.

At the houses scattered here and there along the Via Nomentana, the cocks began to crow, announcing
midnight. At that moment Chilo pulled the corner of Vinicius's mantle and whispered,--"Lord,
I see Urban over there, not far from the old man, and with him is a maiden."

Vinicius shook himself, as if out of a dream, and, turning in the direction indicated by the
Greek, he saw Lygia.

Chapter XXI

EVERY drop of blood quivered in the young patrician at sight of her. He forgot the crowd, the
old man, his own astonishment at the incomprehensible things which he had heard,--he saw only
her. At last, after all his efforts, after long days of alarm, trouble, and suffering, he had
found her! For the first time he realized that joy might rush at the heart, like a wild beast,
and squeeze it till breath was lost. He, who had supposed hitherto that on "Fortuna" had been
imposed a kind of duty to accomplish all his wishes, hardly believed his own eyes now and his
own happiness. Were it not for that disbelief, his passionate nature might have urged him to
some unconsidered step; but he wished to convince himself first that that was not the continuation
of those miracles with which his head was filled, and that he was not dreaming. But there was
no doubt,--he saw Lygia, and an interval of barely a few steps divided them. She stood in perfect
light, so that he could rejoice in the sight of her as much as he liked. The hood had fallen
from her head and dishevelled her hair; her mouth was open slightly, her eyes raised toward
the Apostle, her face fixed in listening and delighted. She was dressed in a dark woollen mantle,
like a daughter of the people, but never had Vinicius seen her more beautiful; and notwithstanding
all the disorder which had risen in him, he was struck by the nobility of that wonderful patrician
head in distinction to the dress, almost that of a slave. Love flew over him like a flame,
immense, mixed with a marvellous feeling of yearning, homage, honor, and desire. He felt the
delight which the sight of her caused him; he drank of her as of life-giving water after long
thirst. Standing near the gigantic Lygian, she seemed to him smaller than before, almost a
child; he noticed, too, that she had grown more slender. Her complexion had become almost transparent;
she made on him the impression of a flower, and a spirit. But all the more did he desire to
possess that woman, so different from all women whom he had seen or possessed in Rome or the
Orient. He felt that for her he would have given them all, and with them Rome and the world
in addition.

He would have lost himself in gazing, and forgotten himself altogether, had it not been for
Chilo, who pulled the corner of his mantle, out of fear that he might do something to expose
them to danger. Meanwhile the Christians began to pray and sing. After a while Maranatha thundered
forth, and then the Great Apostle baptized with water from the fountain those whom the presbyters
presented as ready for baptism. It seemed to Vinicius that that night would never end. He wished
now to follow Lygia as soon as possible, and seize her on the road or at her house.

At last some began to leave the cemetery, and Chilo whispered,--"Let us go out before the gate,
lord, we have not removed our hoods, and people look at us."

Such was the case, for during the discourse of the Apostle all had cast aside their hoods so
as to hear better, and they had not followed the general example. Chilo's advice seemed wise,
therefore. Standing before the gate, they could look at all who passed; Ursus it was easy to
recognize by his form and size.

"Let us follow them," said Chilo; "we shall see to what house they go. To-morrow, or rather
to-day, thou wilt surround the entrances with slaves and take her."

"No!" said Vinicius.

"What dost thou wish to do, lord?"

"We will follow her to the house and take her now, if thou wilt undertake that task, Croton?"

"I will," replied Croton, "and I will give myself to thee as a slave if I do not break the
back of that bison who is guarding her."

But Chilo fell to dissuading and entreating them by all the gods not to do so. Croton was taken
only for defence against attack in case they were recognized, not to carry off the girl. To
take her when there were only two of them was to expose themselves to death, and, what was
worse, they might let her out of their hands, and then she would hide in another place or leave
Rome. And what could they do? Why not act with certainty? Why expose themselves to destruction
and the whole undertaking to failure?

Though Vinicius restrained himself with the greatest effort from seizing Lygia in his arms
at once, right there in the cemetery, he felt that the Greek was right, and would have lent
ear, perhaps, to his counsels, had it not been for Croton, to whom reward was the question.

"Lord, command that old goat to be silent," said he, "or let me drop my fist on his head. Once
in Buxentum, whither Lucius Saturnius took me to a play, seven drunken gladiators fell on me
at an inn, and none of them escaped with sound ribs. I do not say to take the girl now from
the crowd, for they might throw stones before our feet, but once she is at home I will seize
her, carry her away, and take her whithersoever thou shalt indicate."

Vinicius was pleased to hear those words, and answered,--"Thus let it be, by Hercules! To-morrow
we may not find her at home; if we surprise them they will remove the girl surely."

"This Lygian seems tremendously strong!" groaned Chilo.

"No one will ask thee to hold his hands," answered Croton.

But they had to wait long yet, and the cocks had begun to crow before dawn when they saw Ursus
coming through the gate, and with him Lygia. They were accompanied by a number of other persons.
It seemed to Chilo that he recognized among them the Great Apostle; next to him walked another
old man, considerably lower in stature, two women who were not young, and a boy, who lighted
the way with a lantern. After that handful followed a crowd, about two hundred in number; Vinicius,
Chilo, and Croton walked with these people.

"Yes, lord," said Chilo, "thy maiden is under powerful protection. That is the Great Apostle
with her, for see how passing people kneel to him."

People did in fact kneel before him, but Vinicius did not look at them. He did not lose Lygia
from his eyes for a moment; he thought only of bearing her away and, accustomed as he had been
in wars to stratagems of all sorts, he arranged in his head the whole plan of seizure with
soldierly precision. He felt that the step on which he had decided was bold, but he knew well
that bold attacks give success generally.

The way was long; hence at moments he thought too of the gulf which that wonderful religion
had dug between him and Lygia. Now he understood everything that had happened in the past,
and why it had happened. He was sufficiently penetrating for that. Lygia he had not known hitherto.
He had seen in her a maiden wonderful beyond others, a maiden toward whom his feelings were
inflamed: he knew now that her religion made her different from other women, and his hope that
feeling, desire, wealth, luxury, would attract her he knew now to be a vain illusion. Finally
he understood this, which he and Petronius had not understood, that the new religion ingrafted
into the soul something unknown to that world in which he lived, and that Lygia, even if she
loved him, would not sacrifice any of her Christian truths for his sake, and that, if pleasure
existed for her, it was a pleasure different altogether from that which he and Petronius and
Cæsar's court and all Rome were pursuing. Every other woman whom he knew might become his mistress,
but that Christian would become only his victim. And when he thought of this, he felt anger
and burning pain, for he felt that his anger was powerless. To carry off Lygia seemed to him
possible; he was almost sure that he could take her, but he was equally sure that, in view
of her religion, he himself with his bravery was nothing, that his power was nothing, and that
through it he could effect nothing. That Roman military tribune, convinced that the power of
the sword and the fist which had conquered the world, would command it forever, saw for the
first time in life that beyond that power there might be something else; hence he asked himself
with amazement what it was. And he could not answer distinctly; through his head flew merely
pictures of the cemetery, the assembled crowd, and Lygia, listening with her whole soul to
the words of the old man, as he narrated the passion, death, and resurrection of the God-man,
who had redeemed the world, and promised it happiness on the other shore of the Styx.

When he thought of this, chaos rose in his head. But he was brought out of this chaos by Chilo,
who fell to lamenting his own fate. He had agreed to find Lygia. He had sought for her in peril
of his life, and he had pointed her out. But what more do they want? Had he offered to carry
the maiden away? Who could ask anything like this of a maimed man deprived of two fingers,
an old man, devoted to meditation, to science, and virtue? What would happen were a lord of
such dignity as Vinicius to meet some mishap while bearing the maiden away? It is true that
the gods are bound to watch over their chosen ones,--but have not such things happened more
than once, as if the gods were playing games instead of watching what was passing in the world?
Fortune is blindfold, as is well known, and does not see even in daylight; what must the case
be at night? Let something happen,--let that Lygian bear hurl a millstone at the noble Vinicius,
or a keg of wine, or, still worse, water,--who will give assurance that instead of a reward
blame will not fall on the hapless Chilo? He, the poor sage, has attached himself to the noble
Vinicius as Aristotle to Alexander of Macedon. If the noble lord should give him at least that
purse which he had thrust into his girdle before leaving home, there would be something with
which to invoke aid in case of need, or to influence the Christians. Oh, why not listen to
the counsels of an old man, counsels dictated by experience and prudence?

Vinicius, hearing this, took the purse from his belt, and threw it to the fingers of Chilo.

"Thou hast it; be silent!"

The Greek felt that it was unusually heavy, and gained confidence.

"My whole hope is in this," said he, "that Hercules or Theseus performed deeds still more arduous;
what is my personal, nearest friend, Croton, if not Hercules? Thee, worthy lord, I will not
call a demigod, for thou art a full god, and in future thou wilt not forget a poor, faithful
servant, whose needs it will be necessary to provide for from time to time, for once he is
sunk in books, he thinks of nothing else; some few stadia of garden land and a little house,
even with the smallest portico, for coolness in summer, would befit such a donor. Meanwhile
I shall admire thy heroic deeds from afar, and invoke Jove to befriend thee, and if need be
I will make such an outcry that half Rome will be roused to thy assistance. What a wretched,
rough road! The olive oil is burned out in the lantern; and if Croton, who is as noble as he
is strong, would bear me to the gate in his arms, he would learn, to begin with, whether he
will carry the maiden easily; second, he would act like Æneas, and win all the good gods to
such a degree that touching the result of the enterprise I should be thoroughly satisfied."

"I should rather carry a sheep which died of mange a month ago," answered the gladiator; "but
give that purse, bestowed by the worthy tribune, and I will bear thee to the gate."

"Mayst thou knock the great toe from thy foot," replied the Greek; "what profit hast thou from
the teachings of that worthy old man, who described poverty and charity as the two foremost
virtues? Has he not commanded thee expressly to love me? Never shall I make thee, I see, even
a poor Christian; it would be easier for the sun to pierce the walls of the Mamertine prison
than for truth to penetrate thy skull of a hippopotamus."

"Never fear!" said Croton, who with the strength of a beast had no human feeling. "I shall
not be a Christian! I have no wish to lose my bread."

"But if thou knew even the rudiments of philosophy, thou wouldst know that gold is vanity."

"Come to me with thy philosophy. I will give thee one blow of my head in the stomach; we shall
see then who wins."

"An ox might have said the same to Aristotle," retorted Chilo.

It was growing gray in the world. The dawn covered with pale light the outlines of the walls.
The trees along the wayside, the buildings, and the gravestones scattered here and there began
to issue from the shade. The road was no longer quite empty. Marketmen were moving toward the
gates, leading asses and mules laden with vegetables; here and there moved creaking carts in
which game was conveyed. On the road and along both sides of it was a light mist at the very
earth, which promised good weather. People at some distance seemed like apparitions in that
mist. Vinicius stared at the slender form of Lygia, which became more silvery as the light
increased.

"Lord," said Chilo, "I should offend thee were I to foresee the end of thy bounty, but now,
when thou hast paid me, I may not be suspected of speaking for my own interest only. I advise
thee once more to go home for slaves and a litter, when thou hast learned in what house the
divine Lygia dwells; listen not to that elephant trunk, Croton, who undertakes to carry off
the maiden only to squeeze thy purse as if it were a bag of curds."

"I have a blow of the fist to be struck between the shoulders, which means that thou wilt perish,"
said Croton.

"I have a cask of Cephalonian wine, which means that I shall be well," answered Chilo.

Vinicius made no answer, for he approached the gate, at which a wonderful sight struck his
eyes. Two soldiers knelt when the Apostle was passing; Peter placed his hand on their iron
helmets for a moment, and then made the sign of the cross on them. It had never occurred to
the patrician before that there could be Christians in the army; with astonishment he thought
that as fire in a burning city takes in more and more houses, so to all appearances that doctrine
embraces new souls every day, and extends itself over all human understandings. This struck
him also with reference to Lygia, for he was convinced that, had she wished to flee from the
city, there would be guards willing to facilitate her flight. He thanked the gods then that
this had not happened.

After they had passed vacant places beyond the wall, the Christians began to scatter. There
was need, therefore, to follow Lygia more from a distance, and more carefully, so as not to
rouse attention. Chilo fell to complaining of wounds, of pains in his legs, and dropped more
and more to the rear. Vinicius did not oppose this, judging that the cowardly and incompetent
Greek would not be needed. He would even have permitted him to depart, had he wished; but the
worthy sage was detained by circumspection. Curiosity pressed him evidently, since he continued
behind, and at moments even approached with his previous counsels; he thought too that the
old man accompanying the Apostle might be Glaucus, were it not for his rather low stature.

They walked a good while before reaching the Trans-Tiber, and the sun was near rising when
the group surrounding Lygia dispersed. The Apostle, an old woman, and a boy went up the river;
the old man of lower stature, Ursus, and Lygia entered a narrow vicus, and, advancing still
about a hundred yards, went into a house in which were two shops,--one for the sale of olives,
the other for poultry.

Chilo, who walked about fifty yards behind Vinicius and Croton, halted all at once, as if fixed
to the earth, and, squeezing up to the wall, began to hiss at them to turn.

They did so, for they needed to take counsel.

"Go, Chilo," said Vinicius, "and see if this house fronts on another street." Chilo, though
he had complained of wounds in his feet, sprang away as quickly as if he had had the wings
of Mercury on his ankles, and returned in a moment.

"No," said he, "there is but one entrance."

Then, putting his hands together, he said, "I implore thee, lord, by Jupiter, Apollo, Vesta,
Cybele, Isis, Osiris, Mithra Baal, and all the gods of the Orient and the Occident to drop
this plan. Listen to me--"

But he stopped on a sudden, for he saw that Vinicius's face was pale from emotion, and that
his eyes were glittering like the eyes of a wolf. It was enough to look at him to understand
that nothing in the world would restrain him from the undertaking. Croton began to draw air
into his herculean breast, and to sway his undeveloped skull from side to side as bears do
when confined in a cage, but on his face not the least fear was evident.

"I will go in first," said he.

"Thou wilt follow me," said Vinicius, in commanding tones.

And after a while both vanished in the dark entrance.

Chilo sprang to the corner of the nearest alley and watched from behind it, waiting for what
would happen.

Chapter XXII

ONLY inside the entrance did Vinicius comprehend the whole difficulty of the undertaking. The
house was large, of several stories, one of the kind of which thousands were built in Rome,
in view of profit from rent; hence, as a rule, they were built so hurriedly and badly that
scarcely a year passed in which numbers of them did not fall on the heads of tenants. Real
hives, too high and too narrow, full of chambers and little dens, in which poor people fixed
themselves too numerously. In a city where many streets had no names, those houses had no numbers;
the owners committed the collection of rent to slaves, who, not obliged by the city government
to give names of occupants, were ignorant themselves of them frequently. To find some one by
inquiry in such a house was often very difficult, especially when there was no gate-keeper.

Vinicius and Croton came to a narrow, corridor-like passage walled in on four sides, forming
a kind of common atrium for the whole house, with a fountain in the middle whose stream fell
into a stone basin fixed in the ground. At all the walls were internal stairways, some of stone,
some of wood, leading to galleries from which there were entrances to lodgings. There were
lodgings on the ground, also; some provided with wooden doors, others separated from the yard
by woollen screens only. These, for the greater part, were worn, rent, or patched.

The hour was early, and there was not a living soul in the yard. It was evident that all were
asleep in the house except those who had returned from Ostrianum.

"What shall we do, lord?" asked Croton, halting.

"Let us wait here; some one may appear," replied Vinicius. "We should not be seen in the yard."

At this moment, he thought Chilo's counsel practical. If there were some tens of slaves present,
it would be easy to occupy the gate, which seemed the only exit, search all the lodgings simultaneously,
and thus come to Lygia's; otherwise Christians, who surely were not lacking in that house,
might give notice that people were seeking her. In view of this, there was risk in inquiring
of strangers. Vinicius stopped to think whether it would not be better to go for his slaves.
Just then, from behind a screen hiding a remoter lodging, came a man with a sieve in his hand,
and approached the fountain.

At the first glance the young tribune recognized Ursus.

"That is the Lygian!" whispered Vinicius.

"Am I to break his bones now?"

"Wait awhile!"

Ursus did not notice the two men, as they were in the shadow of the entrance, and he began
quietly to sink in water vegetables which filled the sieve. It was evident that, after a whole
night spent in the cemetery, he intended to prepare a meal. After a while the washing was finished;
he took the wet sieve and disappeared behind the screen. Croton and Vinicius followed him,
thinking that they would come directly to Lygia's lodgings. Their astonishment was great when
they saw that the screen divided from the court, not lodgings, but another dark corridor, at
the end of which was a little garden containing a few cypresses, some myrtle bushes, and a
small house fixed to the windowless stone wall of another stone building.

Both understood at once that this was for them a favoring circumstance. In the courtyard all
the tenants might assemble; the seclusion of the little house facilitated the enterprise. They
would set aside defenders, or rather Ursus, quickly, and would reach the street just as quickly
with the captured Lygia; and there they would help themselves. It was likely that no one would
attack them; if attacked, they would say that a hostage was fleeing from Cæsar. Vinicius would
declare himself then to the guards, and summon their assistance.

Ursus was almost entering the little house, when the sound of steps attracted his attention;
he halted, and, seeing two persons, put his sieve on the balustrade and turned to them.

"What do ye want here?" asked he.

"Thee!" said Vinicius.

Then, turning to Croton, he said in a low, hurried voice:

"Kill!"

Croton rushed at him like a tiger, and in one moment, before the Lygian was able to think or
to recognize his enemies, Croton had caught him in his arms of steel.

Vinicius was too confident in the man's preternatural strength to wait for the end of the struggle.
He passed the two, sprang to the door of the little house, pushed it open and found himself
in a room a trifle dark, lighted, however, by a fire burning in the chimney. A gleam of this
fire fell on Lygia's face directly. A second person, sitting at the fire, was that old man
who had accompanied the young girl and Ursus on the road from Ostrianum.

Vinicius rushed in so suddenly that before Lygia could recognize him he had seized her by the
waist, and, raising her, rushed toward the door again. The old man barred the way, it is true;
but pressing the girl with one arm to his breast, Vinicius pushed him aside with the other,
which was free. The hood fell from his head, and at sight of that face, which was known to
her and which at that moment was terrible, the blood grew cold in Lygia from fright, and the
voice died in her throat. She wished to summon aid, but had not the power. Equally vain was
her wish to grasp the door, to resist. Her fingers slipped along the stone, and she would have
fainted but for the terrible picture which struck her eyes when Vinicius rushed into the garden.

Ursus was holding in his arms some man doubled back completely, with hanging head and mouth
filled with blood. When he saw them, he struck the head once more with his fist, and in the
twinkle of an eye sprang toward Vinicius like a raging wild beast.

"Death!" thought the young patrician.

Then he heard, as through a dream, the scream of Lygia, "Kill not!" He felt that something,
as it were a thunderbolt, opened the arms with which he held Lygia; then the earth turned round
with him, and the light of day died in his eyes.

Chilo, hidden behind the angle of the corner house, was waiting for what would happen, since
curiosity was struggling with fear in him. He thought that if they succeeded in carrying off
Lygia, he would fare well near Vinicius. He feared Urban no longer, for he also felt certain
that Croton would kill him. And he calculated that in case a gathering should begin on the
streets, which so far were empty,--if Christians, or people of any kind, should offer resistance,--he,
Chilo, would speak to them as one representing authority, as an executor of Cæsar's will, and
if need came, call the guards to aid the young patrician against the street rabble--thus winning
to himself fresh favor. In his soul he judged yet that the young tribune's method was unwise;
considering, however, Croton's terrible strength, he admitted that it might succeed, and thought,
"If it go hard with him, Vinicius can carry the girl, and Croton clear the way." Delay grew
wearisome, however; the silence of the entrance which he watched alarmed him.

"If they do not hit upon her hiding-place, and make an uproar, they will frighten her."

But this thought was not disagreeable; for Chilo understood that in that event he would be
necessary again to Vinicius, and could squeeze afresh a goodly number of sestertia from the
tribune.

"Whatever they do," said he to himself, "they will work for me, though no one divines that.
O gods! O gods! only permit me-"

And he stopped suddenly, for it seemed to him that some one was bending forward through the
entrance; then, squeezing up to the wall, he began to look, holding the breath in his breast.

And he had not deceived himself, for a head thrust itself half out of the entrance and looked
around. After a while, however, it vanished.

"That is Vinicius, or Croton," thought Chilo; "but if they have taken the girl, why does she
not scream, and why are they looking out to the street? They must meet people anyhow, for before
they reach the Carinæ there will be movement in the city--What is that? By the immortal gods!"

And suddenly the remnant of his hair stood on end.

In the door appeared Ursus, with the body of Croton hanging on his arm, and looking around
once more, he began to run, bearing it along the empty street toward the river.

Chilo made himself as flat against the wall as a bit of mud.

"I am lost if he sees me!" thought he.

But Ursus ran past the corner quickly, and disappeared beyond the neighboring house. Chilo,
without further waiting, his teeth chattering from terror, ran along the cross street with
a speed which even in a young man might have roused admiration.

"If he sees me from a distance when he is returning, he will catch and kill me," said he to
himself. "Save me, Zeus; save me, Apollo; save me, Hermes; save me, O God of the Christians!
I will leave Rome, I will return to Mesembria, but save me from the hands of that demon!"

And that Lygian who had killed Croton seemed to him at that moment some superhuman being. While
running, he thought that he might be some god who had taken the form of a barbarian. At that
moment he believed in all the gods of the world, and in all myths, at which he jeered usually.
It flew through his head, too, that it might be the God of the Christians who had killed Croton;
and his hair stood on end again at the thought that he was in conflict with such a power.

Only when he had run through a number of alleys, and saw some workmen coming toward him from
a distance, was he calmed somewhat. Breath failed in his breast; so he sat on the threshold
of a house and began to wipe, with a corner of his mantle, his sweat-covered forehead.

"I am old, and need calm," said he.

The people coming toward him turned into some little side street, and again the place round
about was empty. The city was sleeping yet. In the morning movement began earlier in the wealthier
parts of the city, where the slaves of rich houses were forced to rise before daylight; in
portions inhabited by a free population, supported at the cost of the State, hence unoccupied,
they woke rather late, especially in winter. Chilo, after he had sat some time on the threshold,
felt a piercing cold; so he rose, and, convincing himself that he had not lost the purse received
from Vinicius, turned toward the river with a step now much slower.

"I may see Croton's body somewhere," said he to himself. "O gods! that Lygian, if he is a man,
might make millions of sestertia in the course of one year; for if he choked Croton, like a
whelp, who can resist him? They would give for his every appearance in the arena as much gold
as he himself weighs. He guards that maiden better than Cerberus does Hades. But may Hades
swallow him, for all that! I will have nothing to do with him. He is too bony. But where shall
I begin in this case? A dreadful thing has happened. If he has broken the bones of such a man
as Croton, beyond a doubt the soul of Vinicius is puling above that cursed house now, awaiting
his burial. By Castor! but he is a patrician, a friend of Cæsar, a relative of Petronius, a
man known in all Rome, a military tribune. His death cannot pass without punishment. Suppose
I were to go to the pretorian camp, or the guards of the city, for instance?"

Here he stopped and began to think, but said after a while,--"Woe is me! Who took him to that
house if not I? His freedmen and his slaves know that I came to his house, and some of them
know with what object. What will happen if they suspect me of having pointed out to him purposely
the house in which his death met him? Though it appear afterward, in the court, that I did
not wish his death, they will say that I was the cause of it. Besides, he is a patrician; hence
in no event can I avoid punishment. But if I leave Rome in silence, and go far away somewhere,
I shall place myself under still greater suspicion."

It was bad in every case. The only question was to choose the less evil. Rome was immense;
still Chilo felt that it might become too small for him. Any other man might go directly to
the prefect of the city guards and tell what had happened, and, though some suspicion might
fall on him, await the issue calmly. But Chilo's whole past was of such character that every
closer acquaintance with the prefect of the city or the prefect of the guard must cause him
very serious trouble, and confirm also every suspicion which might enter the heads of officials.

On the other hand, to flee would be to confirm Petronius in the opinion that Vinicius had been
betrayed and murdered through conspiracy. Petronius was a powerful man, who could command the
police of the whole Empire, and who beyond doubt would try to find the guilty parties even
at the ends of the earth. Still, Chilo thought to go straight to him, and tell what had happened.
Yes; that was the best plan. Petronius was calm, and Chilo might be sure of this, at least,
that he would hear him to the end. Petronius, who knew the affair from its inception, would
believe in Chilo's innocence more easily than would the prefects.

But to go to him, it was needful to know with certainty what had happened to Vinicius. Chilo
did not know that. He had seen, it is true, the Lygian stealing with Croton's body to the river,
but nothing more. Vinicius might be killed; but he might be wounded or detained. Now it occurred
to Chilo for the first time, that surely the Christians would not dare to kill a man so powerful,--a
friend of Cæsar, and a high military official,--for that kind of act might draw on them a general
persecution. It was more likely that they had detained him by superior force, to give Lygia
means to hide herself a second time.

This thought filled Chilo with hope.

"If that Lygian dragon has not torn him to pieces at the first attack, he is alive, and if
he is alive he himself will testify that I have not betrayed him; and then not only does nothing
threaten me, but--O Hermes, count again on two heifers--a fresh field is opening. I can inform
one of the freedmen where to seek his lord; and whether he goes to the prefect or not is his
affair, the only point being that I should not go. Also, I can go to Petronius, and count on
a reward. I have found Lygia; now I shall find Vinicius, and then again Lygia. It is needful
to know first whether Vinicius is dead or living."

Here it occurred to him that he might go in the night to the baker Demas and inquire about
Ursus. But he rejected that thought immediately. He preferred to have nothing to do with Ursus.
He might suppose, justly, that if Ursus had not killed Glaucus he had been warned, evidently,
by the Christian elder to whom he had confessed his design,--warned that the affair was an
unclean one, to which some traitor had persuaded him. In every case, at the mere recollection
of Ursus, a shiver ran through Chilo's whole body. But he thought that in the evening he would
send Euricius for news to that house in which the thing had happened. Meanwhile he needed refreshment,
a bath, and rest. The sleepless night, the journey to Ostrianum, the flight from the Trans-Tiber,
had wearied him exceedingly.

One thing gave him permanent comfort: he had on his person two purses,--that which Vinicius
had given him at home, and that which he had thrown him on the way from the cemetery. In view
of this happy circumstance, and of all the excitement through which he had passed, he resolved
to eat abundantly, and drink better wine than he drank usually.

When the hour for opening the wine-shop came at last, he did so in such a marked measure that
he forgot the bath; he wished to sleep, above all, and drowsiness overcame his strength so
that he returned with tottering step to his dwelling in the Subura, where a slave woman, purchased
with money obtained from Vinicius, was waiting for him.

When he had entered a sleeping-room, as dark as the den of a fox, he threw himself on the bed,
and fell asleep in one instant. He woke only in the evening, or rather he was roused by the
slave woman, who called him to rise, for some one was inquiring, and wished to see him on urgent
business.

The watchful Chilo came to himself in one moment, threw on his hooded mantle hastily, and,
commanding the slave woman to stand aside, looked out cautiously.

And he was benumbed! for he saw before the door of the sleeping-room the gigantic form of Ursus.

At that sight he felt his feet and head grow icy-cold, the heart ceased to beat in his bosom,
and shivers were creeping along his back. For a time he was unable to speak; then with chattering
teeth he said, or rather groaned,--

"Syra--I am not at home--I don't know that--good man-"

"I told him that thou wert at home, but asleep, lord," answered the girl; "he asked to rouse thee."

"O gods! I will command that thou--"

But Ursus, as if impatient of delay, approached the door of the sleeping-room, and, bending,
thrust in his head.

"O Chilo Chilonides!" said he.

"Pax tecum! pax! pax!" answered Chilo. "O best of Christians! Yes, I am Chilo; but this is
a mistake,--I do not know thee!"

"Chilo Chilonides," repeated Ursus, "thy lord, Vinicius, summons thee to go with me to him."

Chapter XXIII

A PIERCING pain roused Vinicius. At the first moment he could not understand where he was,
nor what was happening. He felt a roaring in his head, and his eyes were covered as if with
mist. Gradually, however, his consciousness returned, and at last he beheld through that mist
three persons bending over him. Two he recognized: one was Ursus, the other the old man whom
he had thrust aside when carrying off Lygia. The third, an utter stranger, was holding his
left arm, and feeling it from the elbow upward as far as the shoulder-blade. This caused so
terrible a pain that Vinicius, thinking it a kind of revenge which they were taking, said through
his set teeth, "Kill me!" But they paid no apparent heed to his words, just as though they
heard them not, or considered them the usual groans of suffering. Ursus, with his anxious and
also threatening face of a barbarian, held a bundle of white cloth torn in long strips. The
old man spoke to the person who was pressing the arm of Vinicius,--"Glaucus, art thou certain
that the wound in the head is not mortal?"

"Yes, worthy Crispus," answered Glaucus. "While serving in the fleet as a slave, and afterward
while living at Naples, I cured many wounds, and with the pay which came to me from that occupation
I freed myself and my relatives at last. The wound in the head is slight. When this one [here
he pointed to Ursus with his head] took the girl from the young man, he pushed him against
the wall; the young man while falling put out his arm, evidently to save himself; he broke
and disjointed it, but by so doing saved his head and his life."

"Thou hast had more than one of the brotherhood in thy care," added Crispus, "and hast the
repute of a skilful physician; therefore I sent Ursus to bring thee."

"Ursus, who on the road confessed that yesterday he was ready to kill me!"

"He confessed his intention earlier to me than to thee; but I, who know thee and thy love for
Christ, explained to him that the traitor is not thou, but the unknown, who tried to persuade
him to murder."

"That was an evil spirit, but I took him for an angel," said Ursus, with a sigh.

"Some other time thou wilt tell me, but now we must think of this wounded man." Thus speaking,
he began to set the arm. Though Crispus sprinkled water on his face, Vinicius fainted repeatedly
from suffering; that was, however, a fortunate circumstance, since he did not feel the pain
of putting his arm into joint, nor of setting it. Glaucus fixed the limb between two strips
of wood, which he bound quickly and firmly, so as to keep the arm motionless. When the operation
was over, Vinicius recovered consciousness again and saw Lygia above him. She stood there at
the bed holding a brass basin with water, in which from time to time Glaucus dipped a sponge
and moistened the head of his patient.

Vinicius gazed and could not believe his eyes. What he saw seemed a dream, or the pleasant
vision brought by fever, and only after a long time could he whisper,--"Lygia!"

The basin trembled in her hand at that sound, but she turned on him eyes full of sadness.

"Peace be with thee!" answered she, in a low voice.

She stood there with extended arms, her face full of pity and sorrow. But he gazed, as if to
fill his sight with her, so that after his lids were closed the picture might remain under
them. He looked at her face, paler and smaller than it had been, at the tresses of dark hair,
at the poor dress of a laboring woman; he looked so intently that her snowy forehead began
to grow rose-colored under the influence of his look. And first he thought that he would love
her always; and second, that that paleness of hers and that poverty were his work,--that it
was he who had driven her from a house where she was loved, and surrounded with plenty and
comfort, and thrust her into that squalid room, and clothed her in that poor robe of dark wool.

He would have arrayed her in the costliest brocade, in all the jewels of the earth; hence astonishment,
alarm, and pity seized him, and sorrow so great that he would have fallen at her feet had he
been able to move.

"Lygia," said he, "thou didst not permit my death."

"May God return health to thee," she answered, with sweetness.

For Vinicius, who had a feeling both of those wrongs which he had inflicted on her formerly,
and those which he had wished to inflict on her recently, there was a real balsam in Lygia's
words. He forgot at the moment that through her mouth Christian teaching might speak; he felt
only that a beloved woman was speaking, and that in her answer there was a special tenderness,
a goodness simply preterhuman, which shook him to the depth of his soul. As just before he
had grown weak from pain, so now he grew weak from emotion. A certain faintness came on him,
at once immense and agreeable. He felt as if falling into some abyss, but he felt that to fall
was pleasant, and that he was happy. He thought at that moment of weakness that a divinity
was standing above him.

Meanwhile Glaucus had finished washing the wound in his head, and had applied a healing ointment.
Ursus took the brass basin from Lygia's hands; she brought a cup of water and wine which stood
ready on the table, and put it to the wounded man's lips. Vinicius drank eagerly, and felt
great relief. After the operation the pain had almost passed; the wound and contusion began
to grow firm; perfect consciousness returned to him.

"Give me another drink," said he.

Lygia took the empty cup to the next room; meanwhile Crispus, after a few words with Glaucus,
approached the bed saying,--

"God has not permitted thee, Vinicius, to accomplish an evil deed, and has preserved thee in
life so that thou shouldst come to thy mind. He, before whom man is but dust, delivered thee
defenceless into our hands; but Christ, in whom we believe, commanded us to love even our enemies.
Therefore we have dressed thy wounds, and, as Lygia has said, we will implore God to restore
thy health, but we cannot watch over thee longer. Be in peace, then, and think whether it beseems
thee to continue thy pursuit of Lygia. Thou hast deprived her of guardians, and us of a roof,
though we return thee good for evil."

"Do ye wish to leave me? inquired Vinicius.

"We wish to leave this house, in which prosecution by the prefect of the city may reach us.
Thy companion was killed; thou, who art powerful among thy own people, art wounded. This did
not happen through our fault, but the anger of the law might fall on us."

"Have no fear of prosecution," replied Vinicius; "I will protect you."

Crispus did not like to tell him that with them it was not only a question of the prefect and
the police, but of him; they wished to secure Lygia from his further pursuit.

"Lord," said he, "thy right arm is well. Here are tablets and a stilus; write to thy servants
to bring a litter this evening and bear thee to thy own house, where thou wilt have more comfort
than in our poverty. We dwell here with a poor widow, who will return soon with her son, and
this youth will take thy letter; as to us, we must all find another hiding-place."

Vinicius grew pale, for he understood that they wished to separate him from Lygia, and that
if he lost her now he might never see her in life again. He knew indeed that things of great
import had come between him and her, in virtue of which, if he wished to possess her, he must
seek some new methods which he had not had time yet to think over. He understood too that whatever
he might tell these people, though he should swear that he would return Lygia to Pomponia Græcina,
they would not believe him, and were justified in refusing belief. Moreover, he might have
done that before. Instead of hunting for Lygia, he might have gone to Pomponia and sworn to
her that he renounced pursuit, and in that case Pomponia herself would have found Lygia and
brought her home. No; he felt that such promises would not restrain them, and no solemn oath
would be received, the more since, not being a Christian, he could swear only by the immortal
gods, in whom he did not himself believe greatly, and whom they considered evil spirits.

He desired desperately to influence Lygia and her guardians in some way, but for that there
was need of time. For him it was all-important to see her, to look at her for a few days even.
As every fragment of a plank or an oar seems salvation to a drowning man, so to him it seemed
that during those few days he might say something to bring him nearer to her, that he might
think out something, that something favorable might happen. Hence he collected his thoughts
and said,--

"Listen to me, Christians. Yesterday I was with you in Ostrianum, and I heard your teaching;
but though I did not know it, your deeds have convinced me that you are honest and good people.
Tell that widow who occupies this house to stay in it, stay in it yourselves, and let me stay.
Let this man [here he turned to Glaucus], who is a physician, or at least understands the care
of wounds, tell whether it is possible to carry me from here to-day. I am sick, I have a broken
arm, which must remain immovable for a few days even; therefore I declare to you that I will
not leave this house unless you bear me hence by force!"

Here he stopped, for breath failed in his breast, and Crispus said,--"We will use no force
against thee, lord; we will only take away our own heads."

At this the young man, unused to resistance, frowned and said,--"Permit me to recover breath";
and after a time he began again to speak,--"Of Croton, whom Ursus killed, no one will inquire.
He had to go to-day to Beneventum, whither he was summoned by Vatinius, therefore all will
think that he has gone there. When I entered this house in company with Croton, no one saw
us except a Greek who was with us in Ostrianum. I will indicate to you his lodgings; bring
that man to me. On him I will enjoin silence; he is paid by me. I will send a letter to my
own house stating that I too went to Beneventum. If the Greek has informed the prefect already,
I will declare that I myself killed Croton, and that it was he who broke my arm. I will do
this, by my father's shade and by my mother's! Ye may remain in safety here; not a hair will
fall from the head of one of you. Bring hither, and bring in haste, the Greek whose name is
Chilo Chilonides!"

"Then Glaucus will remain with thee," said Crispus, "and the widow will nurse thee."

"Consider, old man, what I say," said Vinicius, who frowned still more. "I owe thee gratitude,
and thou seemest good and honest; but thou dost not tell me what thou hast in the bottom of
thy soul. Thou art afraid lest I summon my slaves and command them to take Lygia. Is this true?"

"It is," said Crispus, with sternness.

"Then remember this, I shall speak before all to Chilo, and write a letter home that I have
gone to Beneventum. I shall have no messengers hereafter but you. Remember this, and do not
irritate me longer."

Here he was indignant, and his face was contorted with anger. Afterward he began to speak excitedly,--

"Hast thou thought that I would deny that I wish to stay here to see her? A fool would have
divined that, even had I denied it. But I will not try to take her by force any longer. I will
tell thee more: if she will not stay here, I will tear the bandages with this sound hand from
my arm, will take neither food nor drink; let my death fall on thee and thy brethren. Why hast
thou nursed me? Why hast thou not commanded to kill me?" He grew pale from weakness and anger.

Lygia, who had heard all from the other room and who was certain that Vinicius would do what
he promised, was terrified. She would not have him die for anything. Wounded and defenceless,
he roused in her compassion, not fear. Living from the time of her flight among people in continual
religious enthusiasm, thinking only of sacrifices, offerings, and boundless charity, she had
grown so excited herself through that new inspiration, that for her it took the place of house,
family, lost happiness, and made her one of those Christian maidens who, later on, changed
the former soul of the world. Vinicius had been too important in her fate, had been thrust
too much on her, to let her forget him. She had thought of him whole days, and more than once
had begged God for the moment in which, following the inspiration of religion, she might return
good for his evil, mercy for his persecution, break him, win him to Christ, save him. And now
it seemed to her that precisely that moment had come, and that her prayers had been heard.

She approached Crispus therefore with a face as if inspired, and addressed him as though some
other voice spoke through her,--"Let him stay among us, Crispus, and we will stay with him
till Christ gives him health."

The old presbyter, accustomed to seek in all things the inspiration of God, beholding her exaltation,
thought at once that perhaps a higher power was speaking through her, and, fearing in his heart,
he bent his gray head, saying,--"Let it be as thou sayest."

On Vinicius, who the whole time had not taken his eyes from her, this ready obedience of Crispus
produced a wonderful and pervading impression. It seemed to him that among the Christians Lygia
was a kind of sibyl or priestess whom they surrounded with obedience and honor; and he yielded
himself also to that honor. To the love which he felt was joined now a certain awe, in presence
of which love itself became something almost insolent. He could not familiarize himself, however,
with the thought that their relations had changed: that now not she was dependent on his will,
but he on hers; that he was lying there sick and broken; that he had ceased to be an attacking,
a conquering force; that he was like a defenceless child in her care. For his proud and commanding
nature such relations with any other person would have been humiliating; now, however, not
only did he not feel humiliated, but he was thankful to her as to his sovereign. In him those
were feelings unheard-of, feelings which he could not have entertained the day before, and
which would have amazed him even on that day had he been able to analyze them clearly. But
he did not inquire at the moment why it was so, just as if the position had been perfectly
natural; he merely felt happy because he remained there.

And he wished to thank her with gratefulness, and still with a kind of feeling unknown to him
in such a degree that he knew not what to call it, for it was simply submission. His previous
excitement had so exhausted him that he could not speak, and he thanked her only with his eyes,
which were gleaming from delight because he remained near her, and would be able to see her--to-morrow,
next day, perhaps a long time. That delight was diminished only by the dread that he might
lose what he had gained. So great was this dread that when Lygia gave him water a second time,
and the wish seized him to take her hand, he feared to do so. He feared!--he, that Vinicius
who at Cæsar's feast had kissed her lips in spite of her! he, that Vinicius who after her flight
had promised himself to drag her by the hair to the cubiculum, or give command to flog her!

Chapter XXIV

BUT he began also to fear that some outside force might disturb his delight. Chilo might give
notice of his disappearance to the prefect of the city, or to his freedmen at home; and in
such an event an invasion of the house by the city guards was likely. Through his head flew
the thought, it is true, that in that event he might give command to seize Lygia and shut her
up in his house, but he felt that he ought not to do so, and he was not capable of acting thus.
He was tyrannical, insolent, and corrupt enough, if need be he was inexorable, but he was not
Tigellinus or Nero. Military life had left in him a certain feeling of justice, and religion,
and a conscience to understand that such a deed would be monstrously mean. He would have been
capable, perhaps, of committing such a deed during an access of anger and while in possession
of his strength, but at that moment he was filled with tenderness, and was sick. The only question
for Vinicius at that time was that no one should stand between him and Lygia.

He noticed, too, with astonishment, that from the moment when Lygia had taken his part, neither
she herself nor Crispus asked from him any assurances, just as if they felt confident that,
in case of need, some superhuman power would defend them. The young tribune, in whose head
the distinction between things possible and impossible had grown involved and faint since the
discourse of the Apostle in Ostrianum, was also not too far from supposing that that might
take place. But considering things more soberly, he remembered what he had said of the Greek,
and asked again that Chilo be brought to him.

Crispus agreed, and they decided to send Ursus. Vinicius, who in recent days, before his visit
to Ostrianum, had sent slaves frequently to Chilo, though without result, indicated his lodgings
accurately to the Lygian; then writing a few words on the tablet, he said, turning to Crispus,--"I
give a tablet, for this man is suspicious and cunning. Frequently when summoned by me, he gave
directions to answer my people that he was not at home; he did so always when he had no good
news for me, and feared my anger."

"If I find him, I will bring him, willing or unwilling," said Ursus. Then, taking his mantle,
he went out hurriedly.

To find any one in Rome was not easy, even with the most accurate directions; but in those
cases the instinct of a hunter aided Ursus, and also his great knowledge of the city. After
a certain time, therefore, he found himself at Chilo's lodgings.

He did not recognize Chilo, however. He had seen him but once in his life before, and moreover,
in the night. Besides, that lofty and confident old man who had persuaded him to murder Glaucus
was so unlike the Greek, bent double from terror, that no one could suppose the two to be one
person. Chilo, noticing that Ursus looked at him as a perfect stranger, recovered from his
first fear. The sight of the tablet, with the writing of Vinicius, calmed him still more. At
least the suspicion that he would take him into an ambush purposely did not trouble him. He
thought, besides, that the Christians had not killed Vinicius, evidently because they had not
dared to raise hands on so noted a person.

"And then Vinicius will protect me in case of need," thought he; "of course he does not send
to deliver me to death."

Summoning some courage, therefore, he said: "My good man, has not my friend the noble Vinicius
sent a litter? My feet are swollen; I cannot walk so far."

"He has not," answered Ursus; "we shall go on foot."

"But if I refuse?"

"Do not, for thou wilt have to go."

"And I will go, but of my own will. No one could force me, for I am a free man, and a friend
of the prefect of the city. As a sage, I have also means to overcome others, and I know how
to turn people into trees and wild beasts. But I will go, I will go! I will only put on a mantle
somewhat warmer, and a hood, lest the slaves of that quarter might recognize me; they would
stop me every moment to kiss my hands."

He put on a new mantle then, and let down a broad Gallic hood, lest Ursus might recognize his
features on coming into clearer light.

"Where wilt thou take me?" asked he on the road.

"To the Trans-Tiber."

"I am not long in Rome, and I have never been there, but there too, of course, live men who
love virtue."

But Ursus, who was a simple man, and had heard Vinicius say that the Greek had been with him
in Ostrianum, and had seen him with Croton enter the house in which Lygia lived, stopped for
a moment and said,--"Speak no untruth, old man, for to-day thou wert with Vinicius in Ostrianum
and under our gate."

"Ah!" said Chilo, "then is your house in the Trans-Tiber? I have not been long in Rome, and
know not how the different parts are named. That is true, friend; I was under the gate, and
implored Vinicius in the name of virtue not to enter. I was in Ostrianum, and dost thou know
why? I am working for a certain time over the conversion of Vinicius, and wished him to hear
the chief of the Apostles. May the light penetrate his soul and thine! But thou art a Christian,
and wishest truth to overcome falsehood."

"That is true," answered Ursus, with humility.

Courage returned to Chilo completely.

"Vinicius is a powerful lord," said he, "and a friend of Cæsar. He listens often yet to the
whisperings of the evil spirit; but if even a hair should fall from his head, Cæsar would take
vengeance on all the Christians."

"A higher power is protecting us."

"Surely, surely! But what do ye intend to do with Vinicius?" inquired Chilo, with fresh alarm.

"I know not. Christ commands mercy."

"Thou hast answered excellently. Think of this always, or thou wilt fry in hell like a sausage
in a frying-pan."

Ursus sighed, and Chilo thought that he could always do what he liked with that man, who was
terrible at the moment of his first outburst. So, wishing to know what happened at the seizing
of Lygia, he asked further, in the voice of a stern judge,--"How did ye treat Croton? Speak,
and do not prevaricate."

Ursus sighed a second time. "Vinicius will tell thee."

"That means that thou didst stab him with a knife, or kill him with a club."

"I was without arms."

The Greek could not resist amazement at the superhuman strength of the barbarian.

"May Pluto--that is to say, may Christ pardon thee!"

They went on for some time in silence; then Chilo said:

"I will not betray thee; but have a care of the watches."

"I fear Christ, not the watches."

"And that is proper. There is no more grievous crime than murder. I will pray for thee; but
I know not if even my prayer can be effective, unless thou make a vow never to touch any one
in life with a finger."

"As it is, I have not killed purposely," answered Ursus.

But Chilo, who desired to secure himself in every case, did not cease to condemn murder, and
urge Ursus to make the vow. He inquired also about Vinicius; but the Lygian answered his inquiries
unwillingly, repeating that from Vinicius himself he would hear what he needed. Speaking in
this way, they passed at last the long road which separated the lodgings of the Greek from
the Trans-Tiber, and found themselves before the house. Chilo's heart began to beat again unquietly.
From dread it seemed to him that Ursus was beginning to look at him with a kind of greedy expression.

"It is small consolation to me," said he to himself, "if he kills me unwillingly. I prefer
in every case that paralysis should strike him, and with him all the Lygians,--which do thou
effect, O Zeus, if thou art able."

Thus meditating, he wrapped himself more closely in his Gallic mantle, repeating that he feared
the cold. Finally, when they had passed the entrance and the first court, and found themselves
in the corridor leading to the garden of the little house, he halted suddenly and said,--"Let
me draw breath, or I shall not be able to speak with Vinicius and give him saving advice."

He halted; for though he said to himself that no danger threatened, still his legs trembled
under him at the thought that he was among those mysterious people whom he had seen in Ostrianum.

Meanwhile a hymn came to their ears from the little house.

"What is that?" inquired Chilo.

"Thou sayest that thou art a Christian, and knowest not that among us it is the custom after
every meal to glorify our Saviour with singing," answered Ursus. "Miriam and her son must have
returned, and perhaps the Apostle is with them, for he visits the widow and Crispus every day."

"Conduct me directly to Vinicius."

"Vinicius is in the same room with all, for that is the only large one; the others are very
small chambers, to which we go only to sleep. Come in; thou wilt rest there."

They entered. It was rather dark in the room; the evening was cloudy and cold, the flames of
a few candles did not dispel the darkness altogether. Vinicius divined rather than recognized
Chilo in the hooded man. Chilo, seeing the bed in the corner of the room, and on it Vinicius,
moved toward him directly, not looking at the others, as if with the conviction that it would
be safest near him.

"Oh, lord, why didst thou not listen to my counsels?" exclaimed he, putting his hands together.

"Silence!" said Vinicius, "and listen!"

Here he looked sharply into Chilo's eyes, and spoke slowly with emphasis, as if wishing the
Greek to understand every word of his as a command, and to keep it forever in memory.

"Croton threw himself on me to kill and rob me, dost understand? I killed him then, and these
people dressed the wounds which I received in the struggle."

Chilo understood in a moment that if Vinicius spoke in this way it must be in virtue of some
agreement with the Christians, and in that case he wished people to believe him. He saw this,
too, from his face; hence in one moment, without showing doubt or astonishment, he raised his
eyes and exclaimed,--"That was a faith-breaking ruffian! But I warned thee, lord, not to trust
him; my teachings bounded from his head as do peas when thrown against a wall. In all Hades
there are not torments enough for him. He who cannot be honest must be a rogue; what is more
difficult than for a rogue to become honest? But to fall on his benefactor, a lord so magnanimous--O
gods!"

Here he remembered that he had represented himself to Ursus on the way as a Christian, and stopped.

"Were it not for the 'sica,' which I brought, he would have slain me," said Vinicius.

"I bless the moment in which I advised thee to take a knife even."

Vinicius turned an inquiring glance on the Greek, and asked,--"What hast thou done to-day?"

"How? What! have I not told thee, lord, that I made a vow for thy health?"

"Nothing more?"

"I was just preparing to visit thee, when this good man came and said that thou hadst sent for me."

"Here is a tablet. Thou wilt go with it to my house; thou wilt find my freedman and give it
to him. It is written on the tablet that I have gone to Beneventum. Thou wilt tell Demas from
thyself that I went this morning, summoned by an urgent letter from Petronius." Here he repeated
with emphasis: "I have gone to Beneventum, dost understand?"

"Thou has gone, lord. This morning I took leave of thee at the Porta Capena, and from the time
of thy departure such sadness possesses me that if thy magnanimity will not soften it, I shall
cry myself to death, like the unhappy wife of Zethos [Aedon turned into a nightingale] in grief
for Itylos."

Vinicius, though sick and accustomed to the Greek's suppleness, could not repress a smile.
He was glad, moreover, that Chilo understood in a flash; hence he said,

"Therefore I will write that thy tears be wiped away. Give me the candle." Chilo, now pacified
perfectly, rose, and, advancing a few steps toward the chimney, took one of the candles which
was burning at the wall. But while he was doing this, the hood slipped from his head, and the
light fell directly on his face. Glaucus sprang from his seat and, coming up quickly, stood
before him.

"Dost thou not recognize me, Cephas?" asked he. In his voice there was something so terrible
that a shiver ran through all present.

Chilo raised the candle, and dropped it to the earth almost the same instant; then he bent
nearly double and began to groan,--"I am not he--I am not he! Mercy!"

Glaucus turned toward the faithful, and said,--"This is the man who betrayed--who ruined me
and my family!"

That history was known to all the Christians and to Vinicius, who had not guessed who that
Glaucus was,--for this reason only, that he fainted repeatedly from pain during the dressing
of his wound, and had not heard his name. But for Ursus that short moment, with the words of
Glaucus, was like a lightning-flash in darkness. Recognizing Chilo, he was at his side with
one spring, and, seizing his arm, bent it back, exclaiming,--"This is the man who persuaded
me to kill Glaucus!"

"Mercy!" groaned Chilo. "I will give you--O lord!" exclaimed he, turning his head to Vinicius,
"save me! I trusted in thee, take my part. Thy letter--I will deliver it. O lord, lord!"

But Vinicius, who looked with more indifference than any one at what was passing, first because
all the affairs of the Greek were more or less known to him, and second because his heart knew
not what pity was, said,--"Bury him in the garden; some one else will take the letter."

It seemed to Chilo that those words were his final sentence. His bones were shaking in the
terrible hands of Ursus; his eyes were filled with tears from pain.

"By your God, pity!" cried he; "I am a Christian! Pax vobiscum! I am a Christian; and if ye
do not believe me, baptize me again, baptize me twice, ten times! Glaucus, that is a mistake!
Let me speak, make me a slave! Do not kill me! Have mercy!"

His voice, stifled with pain, was growing weaker and weaker, when the Apostle Peter rose at
the table; for a moment his white head shook, drooping toward his breast, and his eyes were
closed; but he opened them then, and said amid silence,--

"The Saviour said this to us: 'If thy brother has sinned against thee, chastise him; but if
he is repentant, forgive him. And if he has offended seven times in the day against thee, and
has turned to thee seven times, saying, "Have mercy on me!" forgive him.'"

Then came a still deeper silence. Glaucus remained a long time with his hands covering his
face; at last he removed them and said,--"Cephas, may God forgive thy offences, as I forgive
them in the name of Christ."

Ursus, letting go the arms of the Greek, added at once:

"May the Saviour be merciful to thee as I forgive thee."

Chilo dropped to the ground, and, supported on it with his hands, turned his head like a wild
beast caught in a snare, looking around to see whence death might come. He did not trust his
eyes and ears yet, and dared not hope for forgiveness. Consciousness returned to him slowly;
his blue lips were still trembling from terror.

"Depart in peace!" said the Apostle, meanwhile.

Chilo rose, but could not speak. He approached the bed of Vinicius, as if seeking protection
in it still; for he had not time yet to think that that man, though he had used his services
and was still his accomplice, condemned him, while those against whom he had acted forgave.
This thought was to come to him later. At present simply astonishment and incredulity were
evident in his look. Though he had seen that they forgave him, he wished to bear away his head
at the earliest from among these incomprehensible people, whose kindness terrified him almost
as much as their cruelty would have terrified. It seemed to him that should he remain longer,
something unexpected would happen again; hence, standing above Vinicius, he said with a broken
voice,--

"Give the letter, lord,--give the letter!"

And snatching the tablet which Vinicius handed him, he made one obeisance to the Christians,
another to the sick man, pushed along sidewise by the very wall, and hurried out through the
door. In the garden, when darkness surrounded him, fear raised the hair on his head again,
for he felt sure that Ursus would rush out and kill him in the night. He would have run with
all his might, but his legs would not move; next moment they were perfectly uncontrollable,
for Ursus stood near him really.

Chilo fell with his face to the earth, and began to groan: "Urban--in Christ's name"--

But Urban said: "Fear not. The Apostle commanded me to lead thee out beyond the gate, lest
thou might go astray in the darkness, and, if strength failed thee, to conduct thee home."

"What dost thou say?" asked Chilo, raising his face. "What? Thou wilt not kill me?"

"No, I will not; and if I seized thee too roughly and harmed a bone in thee, pardon me."

"Help me to rise," said the Greek. "Thou wilt not kill me? Thou wilt not? Take me to the Street;
I will go farther alone."

Ursus raised him as he might a feather, and placed him on his feet; then he conducted him through
the dark corridor to the second court. From there was a passage to the entrance and the street.
In the corridor Chilo repeated again in his soul, "It is all over with me!" Only when he found
himself on the street did he recover and say, "I can go on alone."

"Peace be with thee."

"And with thee! and with thee! Let me draw breath."

And after Ursus had gone, he breathed with a full breast. He felt his waist and hips, as if
to convince himself that he was living, and then moved forward with hurried step.

"But why did they not kill me?" And in spite of all his talk with Euricius about Christian
teaching, in spite of his conversation at the river with Urban, and in spite of all that he
had heard in Ostrianum, he could find no answer to that question.

Chapter XXV

NEITHER could Vinicius discover the cause of what had happened; and in the bottom of his soul
he was almost as much astonished as Chilo. That those people should treat him as they had,
and, instead of avenging his attack, dress his wounds carefully, he ascribed partly to the
doctrine which they confessed, more to Lygia, and a little, also, to his great significance.
But their conduct with Chilo simply went beyond his understanding of man's power of forgiveness.
And the question thrust itself into his mind: Why did they not kill the Greek? They might have
killed him with impunity. Ursus would have buried him in the garden, or borne him in the dark
to the Tiber, which during that period of night-murders, committed by Cæsar himself even, cast
up human bodies so frequently in the morning that no one inquired whence they came. To his
thinking, the Christians had not only the power, but the right to kill Chilo. True, pity was
not entirely a stranger to that world to which the young patrician belonged. The Athenians
raised an altar to pity, and opposed for a long time the introduction of gladiatorial combats
into Athens. In Rome itself the conquered received pardon sometimes, as, for instance, Calicratus,
king of the Britons, who, taken prisoner in the time of Claudius, and provided for by him bountifully,
dwelt in the city in freedom. But vengeance for a personal wrong seemed to Vinicius, as to
all, proper and justified. The neglect of it was entirely opposed to his spirit. True, he had
heard in Ostrianum that one should love even enemies; that, however, he considered as a kind
of theory without application in life. And now this passed through his head: that perhaps they
had not killed Chilo because the day was among festivals, or was in some period of the moon
during which it was not proper for Christians to kill a man. He had heard that there are days
among various nations on which it is not permitted to begin war even. But why, in such a case,
did they not deliver the Greek up to justice? Why did the Apostle say that if a man offended
seven times, it was necessary to forgive him seven times; and why did Glaucus say to Chilo,
"May God forgive thee, as I forgive thee"?

Chilo had done him the most terrible wrong that one man could do another. At the very thought
of how he would act with a man who killed Lygia, for instance, the heart of Vinicius seethed
up, as does water in a caldron; there were no torments which he would not inflict in his vengeance!
But Glaucus had forgiven; Ursus, too, had forgiven,--Ursus, who might in fact kill whomever
he wished in Rome with perfect impunity, for all he needed was to kill the king of the grove
in Nemi, and take his place. Could the gladiator holding that office to which he had succeeded
only by killing the previous "king," resist the man whom Croton could not resist? There was
only one answer to all these questions: that they refrained from killing him through a goodness
so great that the like of it had not been in the world up to that time, and through an unbounded
love of man, which commands to forget one's self, one's wrongs, one's happiness and misfortune,
and live for others. What reward those people were to receive for this, Vinicius heard in Ostrianum,
but he could not understand it. He felt, however, that the earthly life connected with the
duty of renouncing everything good and rich for the benefit of others must be wretched. So
in what he thought of the Christians at that moment, besides the greatest astonishment, there
was pity, and as it were a shade of contempt. It seemed to him that they were sheep which earlier
or later must be eaten by wolves; his Roman nature could yield no recognition to people who
let themselves be devoured. This one thing struck him, however,--that after Chilo's departure
the faces of all were bright with a certain deep joy. The Apostle approached Glaucus, placed
his hand on his head, and said,--"In thee Christ has triumphed."

The other raised his eyes, which were full of hope, and as bright with joy as if some great
unexpected happiness had been poured on him. Vinicius, who could understand only joy or delight
born of vengeance, looked on him with eyes staring from fever, and somewhat as he would on
a madman. He saw, however, and saw not without internal indignation, that Lygia pressed her
lips of a queen to the hand of that man, who had the appearance of a slave; and it seemed to
him that the order of the world was inverted utterly. Next Ursus told how he had conducted
Chilo to the street, and had asked forgiveness for the harm which he might have done his bones;
for this the Apostle blessed him also. Crispus declared that it was a day of great victory.
Hearing of this victory, Vinicius lost the thread of his thought altogether.

But when Lygia gave him a cooling draught again, he held her hand for a moment, and asked,--"Then
must thou also forgive me?"

"We are Christians; it is not permitted us to keep anger in the heart."

"Lygia," said he, "whoever thy God is, I honor Him only because He is thine."

"Thou wilt honor Him in thy heart when thou lovest Him."

"Only because He is thine," repeated Vinicius, in a fainter voice; and he closed his eyes,
for weakness had mastered him again.

Lygia went out, but returned after a time, and bent over him to learn if he were sleeping.
Vinicius, feeling that she was near, opened his eyes and smiled. She placed her hand over them
lightly, as if to incline him to slumber. A great sweetness seized him then; but soon he felt
more grievously ill than before, and was very ill in reality. Night had come, and with it a
more violent fever. He could not sleep, and followed Lygia with his eyes wherever she went.

At times he fell into a kind of doze, in which he saw and heard everything which happened around
him, but in which reality was mingled with feverish dreams. It seemed to him that in some old,
deserted cemetery stood a temple, in the form of a tower, in which Lygia was priestess. He
did not take his eyes from her, but saw her on the summit of the tower, with a lute in her
hands, all in the light, like those priestesses who in the night-time sing hymns in honor of
the moon, and whom he had seen in the Orient. He himself was climbing up winding steps, with
great effort, to bear her away with him. Behind was creeping up Chilo, with teeth chattering
from terror, and repeating, "Do not do that, lord; she is a priestess, for whom He will take
vengeance." Vinicius did not know who that He was, but he understood that he himself was going
to commit some sacrilege, and he felt a boundless fear also. But when he went to the balustrade
surrounding the summit of the tower, the Apostle with his silvery beard stood at Lygia's side
on a sudden, and said:

"Do not raise a hand; she belongs to me." Then he moved forward with her, on a path formed
by rays from the moon, as if on a path made to heaven. He stretched his hands toward them,
and begged both to take him into their company.

Here he woke, became conscious, and looked before him. The lamp on the tall staff shone more
dimly, but still cast a light sufficiently clear. All were sitting in front of the fire warming
themselves, for the night was chilly, and the chamber rather cold. Vinicius saw the breath
coming as steam from their lips. In the midst of them sat the Apostle; at his knees, on a low
footstool, was Lygia; farther on, Glaucus, Crispus, Miriam, and at the edge, on one side Ursus,
on the other Miriam's son Nazarius, a youth with a handsome face, and long, dark hair reaching
down to his shoulders.

Lygia listened with eyes raised to the Apostle, and every head was turned toward him, while
he told something in an undertone. Vinicius gazed at Peter with a certain superstitious awe,
hardly inferior to that terror which he felt during the fever dream. The thought passed through
his mind that that dream had touched truth; that the gray-haired man there, freshly come from
distant shores, would take Lygia from him really, and take her somewhere away by unknown paths.
He felt sure also that the old man was speaking of him, perhaps telling how to separate him
from Lygia, for it seemed to him impossible that any one could speak of aught else. Hence,
collecting all his presence of mind, he listened to Peter's words.

But he was mistaken altogether, for the Apostle was speaking of Christ again.

"They live only through that name," thought Vinicius.

The old man was describing the seizure of Christ. "A company came, and servants of the priest
to seize Him. When the Saviour asked whom they were seeking, they answered, 'Jesus of Nazareth.'
But when He said to them, 'I am He,' they fell on the ground, and dared not raise a hand on
Him. Only after the second inquiry did they seize Him."

Here the Apostle stopped, stretched his hands toward the fire and continued:--"The night was
cold, like this one, but the heart in me was seething; so, drawing a sword to defend Him, I
cut an ear from the servant of the high-priest. I would have defended Him more than my own
life had He not said to me, 'Put thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given
me, shall I not drink it?' Then they seized and bound Him."

When he had spoken thus far, Peter placed his palm on his forehead, and was silent, wishing
before he went further to stop the crowd of his recollections. But Ursus, unable to restrain
himself, sprang to his feet, trimmed the light on the staff till the sparks scattered in golden
rain and the flame shot up with more vigor. Then he sat down, and exclaimed:

"No matter what happened. I--"

He stopped suddenly, for Lygia had put her finger to her lips. But he breathed loudly, and
it was clear that a storm was in his soul; and though he was ready at all times to kiss the
feet of the Apostle, that act was one he could not accept; if some one in his presence had
raised hands on the Redeemer, if he had been with Him on that night--Oi! splinters would have
shot from the soldiers, the servants of the priest, and the officials. Tears came to his eyes
at the very thought of this, and because of his sorrow and mental struggle; for on the one
hand he thought that he would not only have defended the Redeemer, but would have called Lygians
to his aid,--splendid fellows,--and on the other, if he had acted thus he would have disobeyed
the Redeemer, and hindered the salvation of man. For this reason he could not keep back his tears.

After a while Peter took his palm from his forehead, and resumed the narrative. But Vinicius
was overpowered by a new feverish, waking dream. What he heard now was in his mind mixed up
with what the Apostle had told the night previous in Ostrianum, of that day in which Christ
appeared on the shore of the sea of Tiberius. He saw a sheet of water broadly spread out; on
it the boat of a fisherman, and in the boat Peter and Lygia. He himself was moving with all
his might after that boat, but pain in his broken arm prevented him from reaching it. The wind
hurled waves in his eyes, he began to sink, and called with entreating voice for rescue. Lygia
knelt down then before the Apostle, who turned his boat, and reached an oar, which Vinicius
seized: with their assistance he entered the boat and fell on the bottom of it.

It seemed to him, then, that he stood up, and saw a multitude of people sailing after them.
Waves covered their heads with foam; in the whirl only the hands of a few could be seen; but
Peter saved the drowning time after time, and gathered them into his boat, which grew larger,
as if by a miracle. Soon crowds filled it, as numerous as those which were collected in Ostrianum,
and then still greater crowds. Vinicius wondered how they could find place there, and he was
afraid that they would sink to the bottom. But Lygia pacified him by showing him a light on
the distant shore toward which they were sailing. These dream pictures of Vinicius were blended
again with descriptions which he had heard in Ostrianum, from the lips of the Apostle, as to
how Christ had appeared on the lake once. So that he saw now in that light on the shore a certain
form toward which Peter was steering, and as he approached it the weather grew calmer, the
water grew smoother, the light became greater. The crowd began to sing sweet hymns; the air
was filled with the odor of nard; the play of water formed a rainbow, as if from the bottom
of the lake lilies and roses were looking, and at last the boat struck its breast safely against
the sand. Lygia took his hand then, and said, "Come, I will lead thee!" and she led him to
the light.

Vinicius woke again; but his dreaming ceased slowly, and he did not recover at once the sense
of reality. It seemed for a time to him that he was still on the lake, and surrounded by crowds,
among which, not knowing the reason himself, he began to look for Petronius, and was astonished
not to find him. The bright light from the chimney, at which there was no one at that time,
brought him completely to his senses. Olive sticks were burning slowly under the rosy ashes;
but the splinters of pine, which evidently had been put there some moments before, shot up
a bright flame, and in the light of this, Vinicius saw Lygia, sitting not far from his bedside.

The sight of her touched him to the depth of his soul. He remembered that she had spent the
night before in Ostrianum, and had busied herself the whole day in nursing him, and now when
all had gone to rest, she was the only one watching. It was easy to divine that she must be
wearied, for while sitting motionless her eyes were closed. Vinicius knew not whether she was
sleeping or sunk in thought. He looked at her profile, at her drooping lashes, at her hands
lying on her knees; and in his pagan head the idea began to hatch with difficulty that at the
side of naked beauty, confident, and proud of Greek and Roman symmetry, there is another in
the world, new, immensely pure, in which a soul has its dwelling.

He could not bring himself so far as to call it Christian, but, thinking of Lygia, he could
not separate her from the religion which she confessed. He understood, even, that if all the
others had gone to rest, and she alone were watching, she whom he had injured, it was because
her religion commanded her to watch. But that thought, which filled him with wonder for the
religion, was disagreeable to him. He would rather that Lygia acted thus out of love for him,
his face, his eyes, his statuesque form,--in a word for reasons because of which more than
once snow-white Grecian and Roman arms had been wound around his neck.

Still he felt all at once, that, were she like other women, something would be lacking in her.
He was amazed, and knew not what was happening in him; for he saw that new feelings of some
kind were rising in him, new likings, strange to the world in which he had lived hitherto.

She opened her eyes then, and, seeing that Vinicius was gazing at her, she approached him and
said,--"I am with thee."

"I saw thy soul in a dream," replied he.

Chapter XXVI

NEXT morning he woke up weak, but with a cool head and free of fever. It seemed to him that
a whispered conversation had roused him; but when he opened his eyes, Lygia was not there.
Ursus, stooping before the chimney, was raking apart the gray ashes, and seeking live coals
beneath them. When he found some, he began to blow, not with his mouth, but as it were with
the bellows of a blacksmith. Vinicius, remembering how that man had crushed Croton the day
before, examined with attention befitting a lover of the arena his gigantic back, which resembled
the back of a Cyclops, and his limbs strong as columns.

"Thanks to Mercury that my neck was not broken by him," thought Vinicius. "By Pollux! if the
other Lygians are like this one, the Danubian legions will have heavy work some time!"

But aloud he said, "Hei, slave!"

Ursus drew his head out of the chimney, and, smiling in a manner almost friendly, said,--"God
give thee a good day, lord, and good health; but I am a free man, not a slave."

On Vinicius who wished to question Ursus touching Lygia's birthplace, these words produced
a certain pleasant impression; for discourse with a free though a common man was less disagreeable
to his Roman and patrician pride, than with a slave, in whom neither law nor custom recognized
human nature.

"Then thou dost not belong to Aulus?" asked he.

"No, lord, I serve Callina, as I served her mother, of my own will."

Here he hid his head again in the chimney, to blow the coals, on which he had placed some wood.
When he had finished, he took it out and said,--"With us there are no slaves."

"Where is Lygia?" inquired Vinicius.

"She has gone out, and I am to cook food for thee. She watched over thee the whole night."

"Why didst thou not relieve her?"

"Because she wished to watch, and it is for me to obey." Here his eyes grew gloomy, and after
a while he added:

"If I had disobeyed her, thou wouldst not be living."

"Art thou sorry for not having killed me?"

"No, lord. Christ has not commanded us to kill."

"But Atacinus and Croton?"

"I could not do otherwise," muttered Ursus. And he looked with regret on his hands, which had
remained pagan evidently, though his soul had accepted the cross. Then he put a pot on the
crane, and fixed his thoughtful eyes on the fire.

"That was thy fault, lord," said he at last. "Why didst thou raise thy hand against her, a
king's daughter?"

Pride boiled up, at the first moment, in Vinicius, because a common man and a barbarian had
not merely dared to speak to him thus familiarly, but to blame him in addition. To those uncommon
and improbable things which had met him since yesterday, was added another. But being weak
and without his slaves, he restrained himself, especially since a wish to learn some details
of Lygia's life gained the upper hand in him.

When he had calmed himself, therefore, he inquired about the war of the Lygians against Vannius
and the Suevi. Ursus was glad to converse, but could not add much that was new to what in his
time Aulus Plautius had told. Ursus had not been in battle, for he had attended the hostages
to the camp of Atelius Hister. He knew only that the Lygians had beaten the Suevi and the Yazygi,
but that their leader and king had fallen from the arrows of the Yazygi. Immediately after
they received news that the Semnones had set fire to forests on their boundaries, they returned
in haste to avenge the wrong, and the hostages remained with Atelius, who ordered at first
to give them kingly honors. Afterward Lygia's mother died. The Roman commander knew not what
to do with the child. Ursus wished to return with her to their own country, but the road was
unsafe because of wild beasts and wild tribes. When news came that an embassy of Lygians had
visited Pomponius, offering him aid against the Marcomani, Hister sent him with Lygia to Pomponius.
When they came to him they learned, however, that no ambassadors had been there, and in that
way they remained in the camp; whence Pomponius took them to Rome, and at the conclusion of
his triumph he gave the king's daughter to Pomponia Græcina.

Though only certain small details of this narrative had been unknown to Vinicius, he listened
with pleasure, for his enormous pride of family was pleased that an eye-witness had confirmed
Lygia's royal descent. As a king's daughter she might occupy a position at Cæsar's court equal
to the daughters of the very first families, all the more since the nation whose ruler her
father had been, had not warred with Rome so far, and, though barbarian, it might become terrible;
for, according to Atelius Hister himself, it possessed an immense force of warriors. Ursus,
moreover, confirmed this completely.

"We live in the woods," said he, in answer to Vinicius, "but we have so much land that no man
knows where the end is, and there are many people on it. There are also wooden towns in the
forest, in which there is great plenty; for what the Semnones, the Marcomani, the Vandals,
and the Quadi plunder through the world, we take from them. They dare not come to us; but when
the wind blows from their side, they burn our forests. We fear neither them nor the Roman Cæsar."

"The gods gave Rome dominion over the earth," said Vinicius severely.

"The gods are evil spirits," replied Ursus, with simplicity, "and where there are no Romans,
there is no supremacy."

Here he fixed the fire, and said, as if to himself,--"When Cæsar took Callina to the palace,
and I thought that harm might meet her, I wanted to go to the forest and bring Lygians to help
the king's daughter. And Lygians would have moved toward the Danube, for they are virtuous
people though pagan. There I should have given them 'good tidings.' But as it is, if ever Callina
returns to Pomponia Græcina I will bow down to her for permission to go to them; for Christus
was born far away, and they have not even heard of Him. He knew better than I where He should
be born; but if He had come to the world with us, in the forests, we would not have tortured
Him to death, that is certain. We would have taken care of the Child, and guarded Him, so that
never should He want for game, mushrooms, beaver-skins, or amber. And what we plundered from
the Suevi and the Marcomani we would have given Him, so that He might have comfort and plenty."

Thus speaking, he put near the fire the vessel with food for Vinicius, and was silent. His
thoughts wandered evidently, for a time yet, through the Lygian wildernesses, till the liquid
began to boil; then he poured it into a shallow plate, and, cooling it properly, said,--"Glaucus
advises thee, lord, to move even thy sound arm as little as possible; Callina has commanded
me to give thee food."

Lygia commanded! There was no answer to that. It did not even come to Vinicius's head to oppose
her will, just as if she had been the daughter of Cæsar or a goddess. He uttered not a word,
therefore; and Ursus, sitting near his bed, took out the liquid with a small cup, and put it
to his mouth. He did this so carefully, and with such a kindly smile, that Vinicius could not
believe his own eyes, could not think him the same terrible Titan who the day before had crushed
Croton, and, rushing on him like a storm, would have torn him to pieces but for Lygia's pity.
The young patrician, for the first time in life, began to ponder over this: What can take place
in the breast of a simple man, a barbarian, and a servant?

But Ursus proved to be a nurse as awkward as painstaking; the cup was lost among his herculean
fingers so completely that there was no place left for the mouth of the sick man. After a few
fruitless efforts the giant was troubled greatly, and said,--"Li! it would be easier to lead
an aurochs out of a snare."

The anxiety of the Lygian amused Vinicius, but his remark did not interest him less. He had
seen in circuses the terrible urus, brought from wildernesses of the north, against which the
most daring bestiarii went with dread, and which yielded only to elephants in size and strength.

"Hast thou tried to take such beasts by the horns?" inquired he, with astonishment.

"Till the twentieth winter passed over me, I was afraid," answered Ursus; "but after that it
happened."

And he began to feed Vinicius still more awkwardly than before.

"I must ask Miriam or Nazarius," said he.

But now Lygia's pale face appeared from behind the curtain.

"I will assist directly," said she. And after a while she came from the cubiculum, in which
she had been preparing to sleep, as it seemed, for she was in a single close tunic, called
by the ancients capitium, covering the breast completely, and her hair was unbound. Vinicius,
whose heart beat with more quickness at sight of her, began to upbraid her for not thinking
of sleep yet; but she answered joyously,--"I was just preparing to sleep, but first I will
take the place of Ursus."

She took the cup, and, sitting on the edge of the bed, began to give food to Vinicius, who
felt at once overcome and delighted. When she inclined toward him, the warmth of her body struck
him, and her unbound hair fell on his breast. He grew pale from the impression; but in the
confusion and impulse of desires he felt also that that was a head dear above all and magnified
above all, in comparison with which the whole world was nothing. At first he had desired her;
now he began to love her with a full breast. Before that, as generally in life and in feeling,
he had been, like all people of that time, a blind, unconditional egotist, who thought only
of himself; at present he began to think of her.

After a while, therefore, he refused further nourishment; and though he found inexhaustible
delight in her presence and in looking at her, he said,--"Enough! Go to rest, my divine one."

"Do not address me in that way," answered Lygia; "it is not proper for me to hear such words."

She smiled at him, however, and said that sleep had fled from her, that she felt no toil, that
she would not go to rest till Glaucus came. He listened to her words as to music; his heart
rose with increasing delight, increasing gratitude, and his thought was struggling to show
her that gratitude.

"Lygia," said he, after a moment of silence, "I did not know thee hitherto. But I know now
that I wished to attain thee by a false way; hence I say, return to Pomponia Græcina, and be
assured that in future no hand will be raised against thee."

Her face became sad on a sudden. "I should be happy," answered she, "could I look at her, even
from a distance; but I cannot return to her now."

"Why?" inquired Vinicius, with astonishment.

"We Christians know, through Acte, what is done on the Palatine. Hast thou not heard that Cæsar,
soon after my flight and before his departure for Naples, summoned Aulus and Pomponia, and,
thinking that they had helped me, threatened them with his anger? Fortunately Aulus was able
to say to him, 'Thou knowest, lord, that a lie has never passed my lips; I swear to thee now
that we did not help her to escape, and we do not know, as thou dost not, what has happened
to her.' Cæsar believed, and afterward forgot. By the advice of the elders I have never written
to mother where I am, so that she might take an oath boldly at all times that she has no knowledge
of me. Thou wilt not understand this, perhaps, O Vinicius; but it is not permitted us to lie,
even in a question involving life. Such is the religion on which we fashion our hearts; therefore
I have not seen Pomponia from the hour when I left her house. From time to time distant echoes
barely reach her that I am alive and not in danger."

Here a longing seized Lygia, and her eyes were moist with tears; but she calmed herself quickly,
and said,--"I know that Pomponia, too, yearns for me; but we have consolation which others
have not."

"Yes," answered Vinicius, "Christ is your consolation, but I do not understand that."

"Look at us! For us there are no partings, no pains, no sufferings; or if they come they are
turned into pleasure. And death itself, which for you is the end of life, is for us merely
its beginning,--the exchange of a lower for a higher happiness, a happiness less calm for one
calmer and eternal. Consider what must a religion be which enjoins on us love even for our
enemies, forbids falsehood, purifies our souls from hatred, and promises happiness inexhaustible
after death."

"I heard those teachings in Ostrianum, and I have seen how ye acted with me and with Chilo;
when I remember your deeds, they are like a dream, and it seems to me that I ought not to believe
my ears or eyes. But answer me this question: Art thou happy?"

"I am," answered Lygia. "One who confesses Christ cannot be unhappy." Vinicius looked at her,
as though what she said passed every measure of human understanding.

"And hast thou no wish to return to Pomponia?"

"I should like, from my whole soul, to return to her; and shall return, if such be God's will."

"I say to thee, therefore, return; and I swear by my lares that I will not raise a hand against
thee."

Lygia thought for a moment, and answered,--"No, I cannot expose those near me to danger. Cæsar
does not like the Plautiuses. Should I return--thou knowest how every news is spread throughout
Rome by slaves--my return would be noised about in the city. Nero would hear of it surely through
his slaves, and punish Aulus and Pomponia,--at least take me from them a second time."

"True," answered Vinicius, frowning, "that would be possible. He would do so, even to show
that his will must be obeyed. It is true that he only forgot thee, or would remember thee,
because the loss was not his, but mine. Perhaps, if he took thee from Aulus and Pomponia, he
would send thee to me and I could give thee back to them."

"Vinicius, wouldst thou see me again on the Palatine?" inquired Lygia.

He set his teeth, and answered,--"No. Thou art right. I spoke like a fool! No!"

And all at once he saw before him a precipice, as it were without bottom. He was a patrician,
a military tribune, a powerful man; but above every power of that world to which he belonged
was a madman whose will and malignity it was impossible to foresee. Only such people as the
Christians might cease to reckon with Nero or fear him,--people for whom this whole world,
with its separations and sufferings, was as nothing; people for whom death itself was as nothing.
All others had to tremble before him. The terrors of the time in which they lived showed themselves
to Vinicius in all their monstrous extent. He could not return Lygia to Aulus and Pomponia,
then, through fear that the monster would remember her, and turn on her his anger; for the
very same reason, if he should take her as wife, he might expose her, himself, and Aulus. A
moment of ill-humor was enough to ruin all. Vinicius felt, for the first time in life, that
either the world must change and be transformed, or life would become impossible altogether.
He understood also this, which a moment before had been dark to him, that in such times only
Christians could be happy.

But above all, sorrow seized him, for he understood, too, that it was he who had so involved
his own life and Lygia's that out of the complication there was scarcely an outcome. And under
the influence of that sorrow he began to speak:

"Dost thou know that thou art happier than I? Thou art in poverty, and in this one chamber,
among simple people, thou hast thy religion and thy Christ; but I have only thee, and when
I lacked thee I was like a beggar without a roof above him and without bread. Thou art dearer
to me than the whole world. I sought thee, for I could not live without thee. I wished neither
feasts nor sleep. Had it not been for the hope of finding thee, I should have cast myself on
a sword. But I fear death, for if dead I could not see thee. I speak the pure truth in saying
that I shall not be able to live without thee. I have lived so far only in the hope of finding
and beholding thee. Dost thou remember our conversations at the house of Aulus? Once thou didst
draw a fish for me on the sand, and I knew not what its meaning was. Dost thou remember how
we played ball? I loved thee then above life, and thou hadst begun already to divine that I
loved thee. Aulus came, frightened us with Libitina, and interrupted our talk. Pomponia, at
parting, told Petronius that God is one, all-mighty and all-merciful, but it did not even occur
to us that Christ was thy God and hers. Let Him give thee to me and I will love Him, though
He seems to me a god of slaves, foreigners, and beggars. Thou sittest near me, and thinkest
of Him only. Think of me too, or I shall hate Him. For me thou alone art a divinity. Blessed
be thy father and mother; blessed the land which produced thee! I should wish to embrace thy
feet and pray to thee, give thee honor, homage, offerings, thou thrice divine! Thou knowest
not, or canst not know, how I love thee."

Thus speaking, he placed his hand on his pale forehead and closed his eyes. His nature never
knew bounds in love or anger. He spoke with enthusiasm, like a man who, having lost self-control,
has no wish to observe any measure in words or feelings. But he spoke from the depth of his
soul, and sincerely. It was to be felt that the pain, ecstasy, desire, and homage accumulated
in his breast had burst forth at last in an irresistible torrent of words. To Lygia his words
appeared blasphemous, but still her heart began to beat as if it would tear the tunic enclosing
her bosom. She could not resist pity for him and his suffering. She was moved by the homage
with which he spoke to her. She felt beloved and deified without bounds; she felt that that
unbending and dangerous man belonged to her now, soul and body, like a slave; and that feeling
of his submission and her own power filled her with happiness. Her recollections revived in
one moment. He was for her again that splendid Vinicius, beautiful as a pagan god; he, who
in the house of Aulus had spoken to her of love, and roused as if from sleep her heart half
childlike at that time; he from whose embraces Ursus had wrested her on the Palatine, as he
might have wrested her from flames. But at present, with ecstasy, and at the same time with
pain in his eagle face, with pale forehead and imploring eyes,--wounded, broken by love, loving,
full of homage and submissive,--he seemed to her such as she would have wished him, and such
as she would have loved with her whole soul, therefore dearer than he had ever been before.

All at once she understood that a moment might come in which his love would seize her and bear
her away, as a whirlwind; and when she felt this, she had the same impression that he had a
moment before,--that she was standing on the edge of a precipice. Was it for this that she
had left the house of Aulus? Was it for this that she had saved herself by flight? Was it for
this that she had hidden so long in wretched parts of the city? Who was that Vinicius? An Augustian,
a soldier, a courtier of Nero! Moreover he took part in his profligacy and madness, as was
shown by that feast, which she could not forget; and he went with others to the temples, and
made offerings to vile gods, in whom he did not believe, perhaps, but still he gave them official
honor. Still more he had pursued her to make her his slave and mistress, and at the same time
to thrust her into that terrible world of excess, luxury, crime, and dishonor which calls for
the anger and vengeance of God. He seemed changed, it is true, but still he had just said to
her that if she would think more of Christ than of him, he was ready to hate Christ. It seemed
to Lygia that the very idea of any other love than the love of Christ was a sin against Him
and against religion. When she saw then that other feelings and desires might be roused in
the depth of her soul, she was seized by alarm for her own future and her own heart.

At this moment of internal struggle appeared Glaucus, who had come to care for the patient
and study his health. In the twinkle of an eye, anger and impatience were reflected on the
face of Vinicius. He was angry that his conversation with Lygia had been interrupted; and when
Glaucus questioned him, he answered with contempt almost. It is true that he moderated himself
quickly; but if Lygia had any illusions as to this,--that what he had heard in Ostrianum might
have acted on his unyielding nature,--those illusions must vanish. He had changed only for
her; but beyond that single feeling there remained in his breast the former harsh and selfish
heart, truly Roman and wolfish, incapable not only of the sweet sentiment of Christian teaching
but even of gratitude.

She went away at last filled with internal care and anxiety. Formerly in her prayers she had
offered to Christ a heart calm, and really pure as a tear. Now that calmness was disturbed.
To the interior of the flower a poisonous insect had come and began to buzz. Even sleep, in
spite of the two nights passed without sleep, brought her no relief. She dreamed that at Ostrianum
Nero, at the head of a whole band of Augustians, bacchantes, corybantes, and gladiators, was
trampling crowds of Christians with his chariot wreathed in roses; and Vinicius seized her
by the arm, drew her to the quadriga, and, pressing her to his bosom, whispered "Come with us."

Chapter XXVII

FROM that moment Lygia showed herself more rarely in the common chamber, and approached his
couch less frequently. But peace did not return to her. She saw that Vinicius followed her
with imploring glance; that he was waiting for every word of hers, as for a favor; that he
suffered and dared not complain, lest he might turn her away from him; that she alone was his
health and delight. And then her heart swelled with compassion. Soon she observed, too, that
the more she tried to avoid him, the more compassion she had for him; and by this itself the
more tender were the feelings which rose in her. Peace left her. At times she said to herself
that it was her special duty to be near him always, first, because the religion of God commands
return of good for evil; second, that by conversing with him, she might attract him to the
faith. But at the same time conscience told her that she was tempting herself; that only love
for him and the charm which he exerted were attracting her, nothing else. Thus she lived in
a ceaseless struggle, which was intensified daily. At times it seemed that a kind of net surrounded
her, and that in trying to break through it she entangled herself more and more. She had also
to confess that for her the sight of him was becoming more needful, his voice was becoming
dearer, and that she had to struggle with all her might against the wish to sit at his bedside.
When she approached him, and he grew radiant, delight filled her heart. On a certain day she
noticed traces of tears on his eyelids, and for the first time in life the thought came to
her, to dry them with kisses. Terrified by that thought, and full of self-contempt, she wept
all the night following.

He was as enduring as if he had made a vow of patience. When at moments his eyes flashed with
petulance, self-will, and anger, he restrained those flashes promptly, and looked with alarm
at her, as if to implore pardon. This acted still more on her. Never had she such a feeling
of being greatly loved as then; and when she thought of this, she felt at once guilty and happy.
Vinicius, too, had changed essentially. In his conversations with Glaucus there was less pride.
It occurred to him frequently that even that poor slave physician and that foreign woman, old
Miriam, who surrounded him with attention, and Crispus, whom he saw absorbed in continual prayer,
were still human. He was astonished at such thoughts, but he had them. After a time he conceived
a liking for Ursus, with whom he conversed entire days; for with him he could talk about Lygia.
The giant, on his part, was inexhaustible in narrative, and while performing the most simple
services for the sick man, he began to show him also some attachment. For Vinicius, Lygia had
been at all times a being of another order, higher a hundred times than those around her: nevertheless,
he began to observe simple and poor people,--a thing which he had never done before,--and he
discovered in them various traits the existence of which he had never suspected.

Nazarius, however, he could not endure, for it seemed to him that the young lad had dared to
fall in love with Lygia. He had restrained his aversion for a long time, it is true; but once
when he brought her two quails, which he had bought in the market with his own earned money,
the descendant of the Quirites spoke out in Vinicius, for whom one who had wandered in from
a strange people had less worth than the meanest worm. When he heard Lygia's thanks, he grew
terribly pale; and when Nazarius went out to get water for the birds, he said,--"Lygia, canst
thou endure that he should give thee gifts? Dost thou not know that the Greeks call people
of his nation Jewish dogs?"

"I do not know what the Greeks call them; but I know that Nazarius is a Christian and my brother."

When she had said this she looked at Vinicius with astonishment and regret, for he had disaccustomed
her to similar outbursts; and he set his teeth, so as not to tell her that he would have given
command to beat such a brother with sticks, or would have sent him as a compeditus [A man who
labors with chained feet] to dig earth in his Sicilian vineyards. He restrained himself, however,
throttled the anger within him, and only after a while did he say,--"Pardon me, Lygia. For
me thou art the daughter of a king and the adopted child of Plautius." And he subdued himself
to that degree that when Nazarius appeared in the chamber again, he promised him, on returning
to his villa, the gift of a pair of peacocks or flamingoes, of which he had a garden full.

Lygia understood what such victories over himself must have cost him; but the oftener he gained
them the more her heart turned to him. His merit with regard to Nazarius was less, however,
than she supposed. Vinicius might be indignant for a moment, but he could not be jealous of
him. In fact the son of Miriam did not, in his eyes, mean much more than a dog; besides, he
was a child yet, who, if he loved Lygia, loved her unconsciously and servilely. Greater struggles
must the young tribune have with himself to submit, even in silence, to that honor with which
among those people the name of Christ and His religion was surrounded. In this regard wonderful
things took place in Vinicius. That was in every case a religion which Lygia believed; hence
for that single reason he was ready to receive it. Afterward, the more he returned to health,
the more he remembered the whole series of events which had happened since that night at Ostrianum,
and the whole series of thoughts which had come to his head from that time, the more he was
astonished at the superhuman power of that religion which changed the souls of men to their
foundations. He understood that in it there was something uncommon, something which had not
been on earth before, and he felt that could it embrace the whole world, could it ingraft on
the world its love and charity, an epoch would come recalling that in which not Jupiter, but
Saturn had ruled. He did not dare either to doubt the supernatural origin of Christ, or His
resurrection, or the other miracles. The eye-witnesses who spoke of them were too trustworthy
and despised falsehood too much to let him suppose that they were telling things that had not
happened. Finally, Roman scepticism permitted disbelief in the gods, but believed in miracles.
Vinicius, therefore, stood before a kind of marvellous puzzle which he could not solve. On
the other hand, however, that religion seemed to him opposed to the existing state of things,
impossible of practice, and mad in a degree beyond all others. According to him, people in
Rome and in the whole world might be bad, but the order of things was good. Had Cæsar, for
example, been an honest man, had the Senate been composed, not of insignificant libertines,
but of men like Thrasea, what more could one wish? Nay, Roman peace and supremacy were good;
distinction among people just and proper. But that religion, according to the understanding
of Vinicius, would destroy all order, all supremacy, every distinction. What would happen then
to the dominion and lordship of Rome? Could the Romans cease to rule, or could they recognize
a whole herd of conquered nations as equal to themselves? That was a thought which could find
no place in the head of a patrician. As regarded him personally, that religion was opposed
to all his ideas and habits, his whole character and understanding of life. He was simply unable
to imagine how he could exist were he to accept it. He feared and admired it; but as to accepting
it, his nature shuddered at that. He understood, finally, that nothing save that religion separated
him from Lygia; and when he thought of this, he hated it with all the powers of his soul.

Still he acknowledged to himself that it had adorned Lygia with that exceptional, unexplained
beauty which in his heart had produced, besides love, respect, besides desire, homage, and
had made of that same Lygia a being dear to him beyond all others in the world. And then he
wished anew to love Christ. And he understood clearly that he must either love or hate Him;
he could not remain indifferent. Meanwhile two opposing currents were as if driving him: he
hesitated in thoughts, in feelings; he knew not how to choose, he bowed his head, however,
to that God by him uncomprehended, and paid silent honor for this sole reason, that He was
Lygia's God.

Lygia saw what was happening in him; she saw how he was breaking himself, how his nature was
rejecting that religion; and though this mortified her to the death, compassion, pity, and
gratitude for the silent respect which he showed Christ inclined her heart to him with irresistible
force. She recalled Pomponia Græcina and Aulus. For Pomponia a source of ceaseless sorrow and
tears that never dried was the thought that beyond the grave she would not find Aulus. Lygia
began now to understand better that pain, that bitterness. She too had found a being dear to
her, and she was threatened by eternal separation from this dear one.

At times, it is true, she was self-deceived, thinking that his soul would open itself to Christ's
teaching; but these illusions could not remain. She knew and understood him too well. Vinicius
a Christian!--These two ideas could find no place together in her unenlightened head. If the
thoughtful, discreet Aulus had not become a Christian under the influence of the wise and perfect
Pomponia, how could Vinicius become one? To this there was no answer, or rather there was only
one,--that for him there was neither hope nor salvation.

But Lygia saw with terror that that sentence of condemnation which hung over him instead of
making him repulsive made him still dearer simply through compassion. At moments the wish seized
her to speak to him of his dark future; but once, when she had sat near him and told him that
outside Christian truth there was no life, he, having grown stronger at that time, rose on
his sound arm and placed his head on her knees suddenly. "Thou art life!" said he. And that
moment breath failed in her breast, presence of mind left her, a certain quiver of ecstasy
rushed over her from head to feet. Seizing his temples with her hands, she tried to raise him,
but bent the while so that her lips touched his hair; and for a moment both were overcome with
delight, with themselves, and with love, which urged them the one to the other.

Lygia rose at last and rushed away, with a flame in her veins and a giddiness in her head;
but that was the drop which overflowed the cup filled already to the brim. Vinicius did not
divine how dearly he would have to pay for that happy moment, but Lygia understood that now
she herself needed rescue. She spent the night after that evening without sleep, in tears and
in prayer, with the feeling that she was unworthy to pray and could not be heard. Next morning
she went from the cubiculum early, and, calling Crispus to the garden summer-house, covered
with ivy and withered vines, opened her whole soul to him, imploring him at the same time to
let her leave Miriam's house, since she could not trust herself longer, and could not overcome
her heart's love for Vinicius.

Crispus, an old man, severe and absorbed in endless enthusiasm, consented to the plan of leaving
Miriam's house, but he had no words of forgiveness for that love, to his thinking sinful. His
heart swelled with indignation at the very thought that Lygia, whom he had guarded since the
time of her flight, whom he had loved, whom he had confirmed in the faith, and on whom he looked
now as a white lily grown up on the field of Christian teaching undefiled by any earthly breath,
could have found a place in her soul for love other than heavenly. He had believed hitherto
that nowhere in the world did there beat a heart more purely devoted to the glory of Christ.
He wanted to offer her to Him as a pearl, a jewel, the precious work of his own hands; hence
the disappointment which he felt filled him with grief and amazement.

"Go and beg God to forgive thy fault," said he, gloomily. "Flee before the evil spirit who
involved thee bring thee to utter fall, and before thou oppose the Saviour. God died on the
cross to redeem thy soul with His blood, but thou hast preferred to love him who wished to
make thee his concubine. God saved thee by a miracle of His own hands, but thou hast opened
thy heart to impure desire, and hast loved the son of darkness. Who is he? The friend and servant
of Antichrist, his copartner in crime and profligacy. Whither will he lead thee, if not to
that abyss and to that Sodom in which he himself is living, but which God will destroy with
the flame of His anger? But I say to thee, would thou hadst died, would the walls of this house
had fallen on thy head before that serpent had crept into thy bosom and beslimed it with the
poison of iniquity."

And he was borne away more and more, for Lygia's fault filled him not only with anger but with
loathing and contempt for human nature in general, and in particular for women, whom even Christian
truth could not save from Eve's weakness. To him it seemed nothing that the maiden had remained
pure, that she wished to flee from that love, that she had confessed it with compunction and
penitence. Crispus had wished to transform her into an angel, to raise her to heights where
love for Christ alone existed, and she had fallen in love with an Augustian. The very thought
of that filled his heart with horror, strengthened by a feeling of disillusion and disappointment.
No, no, he could not forgive her. Words of horror burned his lips like glowing coals; he struggled
still with himself not to utter them, but he shook his emaciated hands over the terrified girl.
Lygia felt guilty, but not to that degree. She had judged even that withdrawal from Miriam's
house would be her victory over temptation, and would lessen her fault. Crispus rubbed her
into the dust; showed her all the misery and insignificance of her soul, which she had not
suspected hitherto. She had judged even that the old presbyter, who from the moment of her
flight from the Palatine had been to her as a father, would show some compassion, console her,
give her courage, and strengthen her.

"I offer my pain and disappointment to God," said he, "but thou hast deceived the Saviour also,
for thou hast gone as it were to a quagmire which has poisoned thy soul with its miasma. Thou
mightst have offered it to Christ as a costly vessel, and said to Him, 'Fill it with grace,
O Lord!' but thou hast preferred to offer it to the servant of the evil one. May God forgive
thee and have mercy on thee; for till thou cast out the serpent, I who held thee as chosen-"

But he ceased suddenly to speak, for he saw that they were not alone. Through the withered
vines and the ivy, which was green alike in summer and winter, he saw two men, one of whom
was Peter the Apostle. The other he was unable to recognize at once, for a mantle of coarse
woollen stuff, called cilicium, concealed a part of his face. It seemed to Crispus for a moment
that that was Chilo.

They, hearing the loud voice of Crispus, entered the summer-house and sat on a stone bench.
Peter's companion had an emaciated face; his head, which was growing bald, was covered at the
sides with curly hair; he had reddened eyelids and a crooked nose; in the face, ugly and at
the same time inspired, Crispus recognized the features of Paul of Tarsus.

Lygia, casting herself on her knees, embraced Peter's feet, as if from despair, and, sheltering
her tortured head in the fold of his mantle, remained thus in silence.

"Peace to your souls!" said Peter.

And seeing the child at his feet he asked what had happened. Crispus began then to narrate
all that Lygia had confessed to him,--her sinful love, her desire to flee from Miriam's house,--and
his sorrow that a soul which he had thought to offer to Christ pure as a tear had defiled itself
with earthly feelings for a sharer in all those crimes into which the pagan world had sunk,
and which called for God's vengeance.

Lygia during his speech embraced with increasing force the feet of the Apostle, as if wishing
to seek refuge near them, and to beg even a little compassion.

But the Apostle, when he had listened to the end, bent down and placed his aged hand on her
head; then he raised his eyes to the old presbyter, and said,--"Crispus, hast thou not heard
that our beloved Master was in Cana, at a wedding, and blessed love between man and woman?"

Crispus's hands dropped, and he looked with astonishment on the speaker, without power to utter
one word. After a moment's silence Peter asked again,--"Crispus, dost thou think that Christ,
who permitted Mary of Magdala to lie at his feet, and who forgave the public sinner, would
turn from this maiden, who is as pure as a lily of the field?"

Lygia nestled up more urgently to the feet of Peter, with sobbing, understanding that she had
not sought refuge in vain. The Apostle raised her face, which was covered with tears, and said
to her,--"While the eyes of him whom thou lovest are not open to the light of truth, avoid
him, lest he bring thee to sin, but pray for him, and know that there is no sin in thy love.
And since it is thy wish to avoid temptation, this will be accounted to thee as a merit. Do
not suffer, and do not weep; for I tell thee that the grace of the Redeemer has not deserted
thee, and that thy prayers will be heard; after sorrow will come days of gladness."

When he had said this, he placed both hands on her head, and, raising his eyes, blessed her.
From his face there shone a goodness beyond that of earth.

The penitent Crispus began humbly to explain himself; "I have sinned against mercy," said he;
"but I thought that by admitting to her heart an earthly love she had denied Christ."

"I denied Him thrice," answered Peter, "and still He forgave me, and commanded me to feed His
sheep."

"And because," concluded Crispus, "Vinicius is an Augustian."

"Christ softened harder hearts than his," replied Peter.

Then Paul of Tarsus, who had been silent so far, placed his finger on his breast, pointing
to himself, and said,--"I am he who persecuted and hurried servants of Christ to their death;
I am he who during the stoning of Stephen kept the garments of those who stoned him; I am he
who wished to root out the truth in every part of the inhabited earth, and yet the Lord predestined
me to declare it in every land. I have declared it in Judea, in Greece, on the Islands, and
in this godless city, where first I resided as a prisoner. And now when Peter, my superior,
has summoned me, I enter this house to bend that proud head to the feet of Christ, and cast
a grain of seed in that stony field, which the Lord will fertilize, so that it may bring forth
a bountiful harvest."

And he rose. To Crispus that diminutive hunchback seemed then that which he was in reality,--a
giant, who was to stir the world to its foundations and gather in lands and nations.

Chapter XXVIII

PETRONIUS to VINICIUS:--"Have pity, carissime; imitate not in thy letters the Lacedemonians
or Julius Cæsar! Couldst thou, like Julius, write Veni, vidi, vici (I came, I saw, I conquered),
I might understand thy brevity. But thy letter means absolutely Veni, vidi, fugi (I came, I
saw, I fled). Since such a conclusion of the affair is directly opposed to thy nature, since
thou art wounded, and since, finally, uncommon things are happening to thee, thy letter needs
explanation. I could not believe my eyes when I read that the Lygian giant killed Croton as
easily as a Caledonian dog would kill a wolf in the defiles of Hibernia. That man is worth
as much gold as he himself weighs, and it depends on him alone to become a favorite of Cæsar.
When I return to the city, I must gain a nearer acquaintance with that Lygian, and have a bronze
statue of him made for myself. Ahenobarbus will burst from curiosity, when I tell him that
it is from nature. Bodies really athletic are becoming rarer in Italy and in Greece; of the
Orient no mention need be made; the Germans, though large, have muscles covered with fat, and
are greater in bulk than in strength. Learn from the Lygian if he is an exception, or if in
his country there are more men like him. Should it happen sometime to thee or me to organize
games officially, it would be well to know where to seek for the best bodies.

"But praise to the gods of the Orient and the Occident that thou hast come out of such hands
alive. Thou hast escaped, of course, because thou art a patrician, and the son of a consul;
but everything which has happened astonishes me in the highest degree,--that cemetery where
thou wert among the Christians, they, their treatment of thee, the subsequent flight of Lygia;
finally, that peculiar sadness and disquiet which breathes from thy short letter. Explain,
for there are many points which I cannot understand; and if thou wish the truth, I will tell
thee plainly, that I understand neither the Christians nor thee nor Lygia. Wonder not that
I, who care for few things on earth except my own person, inquire of thee so eagerly. I have
contributed to all this affair of thine; hence it is my affair so far. Write soon, for I cannot
foresee surely when we may meet. In Bronzebeard's head plans change, as winds do in autumn.
At present, while tarrying in Beneventum, he has the wish to go straightway to Greece, without
returning to Rome. Tigellinus, however, advises him to visit the city even for a time, since
the people, yearning overmuch for his person (read 'for games and bread') may revolt. So I
cannot tell how it will be. Should Achæa overbalance, we may want to see Egypt. I should insist
with all my might on thy coming, for I think that in thy state of mind travelling and our amusements
would be a medicine, but thou mightst not find us. Consider, then, whether in that case repose
in thy Sicilian estates would not be preferable to remaining in Rome. Write me minutely of
thyself, and farewell. I add no wish this time, except health; for, by Pollux! I know not what
to wish thee."

Vinicius, on receiving this letter, felt at first no desire to reply. He had a kind of feeling
that it was not worth while to reply, that an answer would benefit no one in any way, that
it would explain nothing. Discontent, and a feeling of the vanity of life, possessed him. He
thought, moreover, that Petronius would not comprehend him in any case, and that something
had happened which would remove them from each other. He could not come to an agreement with
himself, even. When he returned from the Trans-Tiber to his splendid "insula," he was exhausted,
and found for the first days a certain satisfaction in rest and in the comfort and abundance
about him. That satisfaction lasted but a short time, however. He felt soon that he was living
in vanity; that all which so far had formed the interest of his life either had ceased to exist
for him or had shrunk to proportions barely perceptible. He had a feeling as if those ties
which hitherto had connected him with life had been cut in his soul, and that no new ones had
been formed. At the thought that he might go to Beneventum and thence to Achæa, to swim in
a life of luxury and wild excess, he had a feeling of emptiness. "To what end? What shall I
gain from it?" These were the first questions which passed through his head. And for the first
time in life, also, he thought that if he went, the conversation of Petronius, his wit, his
quickness, his exquisite outlining of thought, and his choice of apt phrases for every idea
might annoy him.

But solitude, too, had begun to annoy him. All his acquaintances were with Cæsar in Beneventum;
so he had to stay at home alone, with a head full of thoughts, and a heart full of feelings
which he could not analyze. He had moments, however, in which he judged that if he could converse
with some one about everything that took place in him, perhaps he might be able to grasp it
all somehow, bring it to order, and estimate it better. Under the influence of this hope, and
after some days of hesitation, he decided to answer Petronius; and, though not certain that
he would send the answer, he wrote it in the following words:--

"It is thy wish that I write more minutely, agreed then; whether I shall be able to do it more
clearly, I cannot tell, for there are many knots which I know not myself how to loosen. I described
to thee my stay among the Christians, and their treatment of enemies, among whom they had a
right to count both me and Chilo; finally, of the kindness with which they nursed me, and of
the disappearance of Lygia. No, my dear friend, I was not spared because of being the son of
a consul. Such considerations do not exist for them, since they forgave even Chilo, though
I urged them to bury him in the garden. Those are people such as the world has not seen hitherto,
and their teaching is of a kind that the world has not heard up to this time. I can say nothing
else, and he errs who measures them with our measure. I tell thee that, if I had been lying
with a broken arm in my own house, and if my own peoples, even my own family, had nursed me,
I should have had more comforts, of course, but I should not have received half the care which
I found among them.

"Know this, too, that Lygia is like the others. Had she been my sister or my wife, she could
not have nursed me more tenderly. Delight filled my heart more than once, for I judged that
love alone could inspire the like tenderness. More than once I saw love in her look, in her
face; and, wilt thou believe me? among those simple people then in that poor chamber, which
was at once a culina and a triclinium, I felt happier than ever before. No; she was not indifferent
to me--and to-day even I cannot think that she was. Still that same Lygia left Miriam's dwelling
in secret because of me. I sit now whole days with my head on my hands, and think, Why did
she do so? Have I written thee that I volunteered to restore her to Aulus? True, she declared
that to be impossible at present, because Aulus and Pomponia had gone to Sicily, and because
news of her return going from house to house, through slaves, would reach the Palatine, and
Cæsar might take her from Aulus again. But she knew that I would not pursue her longer; that
I had left the way of violence; that, unable to cease loving her or to live without her, I
would bring her into my house through a wreathed door, and seat her on a sacred skin at my
hearth. Still she fled! Why? Nothing was threatening her. Did she not love me, she might have
rejected me. The day before her flight, I made the acquaintance of a wonderful man, a certain
Paul of Tarsus, who spoke to me of Christ and His teachings, and spoke with such power that
every word of his, without his willing it, turns all the foundations of our society into ashes.
That same man visited me after her flight, and said: 'If God open thy eyes to the light, and
take the beam from them as He took it from mine, thou wilt feel that she acted properly; and
then, perhaps, thou wilt find her.' And now I am breaking my head over these words, as if I
had heard them from the mouth of the Pythoness at Delphi. I seem to understand something. Though
they love people, the Christians are enemies of our life, our gods, and our crimes; hence she
fled from me, as from a man who belongs to our society, and with whom she would have to share
a life counted criminal by Christians. Thou wilt say that since she might reject me, she had
no need to withdraw. But if she loved me? In that case she desired to flee from love. At the
very thought of this I wish to send slaves into every alley in Rome, and command them to cry
throughout the houses, 'Return, Lygia!' But I cease to understand why she fled. I should not
have stopped her from believing in her Christ, and would myself have reared an altar to Him
in the atrium. What harm could one more god do me? Why might I not believe in him,--I who do
not believe overmuch in the old gods? I know with full certainty that the Christians do not
lie; and they say that he rose from the dead. A man cannot rise from the dead. That Paul of
Tarsus, who is a Roman citizen, but who, as a Jew, knows the old Hebrew writings, told me that
the coming of Christ was promised by prophets for whole thousands of years. All these are uncommon
things, but does not the uncommon surround us on every side? People have not ceased talking
yet of Apollonius of Tyana. Paul's statement that there is one God, not a whole assembly of
them, seems sound to me. Perhaps Seneca is of this opinion, and before him many others. Christ
lived, gave Himself to be crucified for the salvation of the world, and rose from the dead.
All this is perfectly certain. I do not see, therefore, a reason why I should insist on an
opposite opinion, or why I should not rear to Him an altar, if I am ready to rear one to Serapis,
for instance. It would not be difficult for me even to renounce other gods, for no reasoning
mind believes in them at present. But it seems that all this is not enough yet for the Christians.
It is not enough to honor Christ, one must also live according to His teachings; and here thou
art on the shore of a sea which they command thee to wade through.

"If I promised to do so, they themselves would feel that the promise was an empty sound of
words. Paul told me so openly. Thou knowest how I love Lygia, and knowest that there is nothing
that I would not do for her. Still, even at her wish, I cannot raise Soracte or Vesuvius on
my shoulders, or place Thrasymene Lake on the palm of my hand, or from black make my eyes blue,
like those of the Lygians. If she so desired, I could have the wish, but the change does not
lie in my power. I am not a philosopher, but also I am not so dull as I have seemed, perhaps,
more than once to thee. I will state now the following: I know not how the Christians order
their own lives, but I know that where their religion begins, Roman rule ends, Rome itself
ends, our mode of life ends, the distinction between conquered and conqueror, between rich
and poor, lord and slave, ends, government ends, Cæsar ends, law and all the order of the world
ends; and in place of those appear Christ, with a certain mercy not existent hitherto, and
kindness, opposed to human and our Roman instincts. It is true that Lygia is more to me than
all Rome and its lordship; and I would let society vanish could I have her in my house. But
that is another thing. Agreement in words does not satisfy the Christians; a man must feel
that their teaching is truth, and not have aught else in his soul. But that, the gods are my
witnesses, is beyond me. Dost understand what that means? There is something in my nature which
shudders at this religion; and were my lips to glorify it, were I to conform to its precepts,
my soul and my reason would say that I do so through love for Lygia, and that apart from her
there is to me nothing on earth more repulsive. And, a strange thing, Paul of Tarsus understands
this, and so does that old theurgus Peter, who in spite of all his simplicity and low origin
is the highest among them, and was the disciple of Christ. And dost thou know what they are
doing? They are praying for me, and calling down something which they call grace; but nothing
descends on me, save disquiet, and a greater yearning for Lygia.

"I have written thee that she went away secretly; but when going she left me a cross which
she put together from twigs of boxwood. When I woke up, I found it near my bed. I have it now
in the lararium, and I approach it yet, I cannot tell why, as if there were something divine
in it,--that is, with awe and reverence. I love it because her hand bound it, and I hate it
because it divides us. At times it seems to me that there are enchantments of some kind in
all this affair, and that the theurgus, Peter, though he declares himself to be a simple shepherd,
is greater than Apollonius, and all who preceded him, and that he has involved us all--Lygia,
Pomponia, and me--with them.

"Thou hast written that in my previous letter disquiet and sadness are visible. Sadness there
must be, for I have lost her again, and there is disquiet because something has changed in
me. I tell thee sincerely, that nothing is more repugnant to my nature than that religion,
and still I cannot recognize myself since I met Lygia. Is it enchantment, or love? Circe changed
people's bodies by touching them, but my soul has been changed. No one but Lygia could have
done that, or rather Lygia through that wonderful religion which she professes. When I returned
to my house from the Christians, no one was waiting for me. The slaves thought that I was in
Beneventum, and would not return soon; hence there was disorder in the house. I found the slaves
drunk, and a feast, which they were giving themselves, in my triclinium. They had more thought
of seeing death than me, and would have been less terrified by it. Thou knowest with what a
firm hand I hold my house; all to the last one dropped on their knees, and some fainted from
terror. But dost thou know how I acted? At the first moment I wished to call for rods and hot
iron, but immediately a kind of shame seized me, and, wilt thou lend belief? a species of pity
for those wretched people. Among them are old slaves whom my grandfather, Marcus Vinicius,
brought from the Rhine in the time of Augustus. I shut myself up alone in the library, and
there came stranger thoughts still to my head; namely, that after what I had heard and seen
among the Christians, it did not become me to act with slaves as I had acted hitherto--that
they too were people. For a number of days they moved about in mortal terror, in the belief
that I was delaying so as to invent punishment the more cruel, but I did not punish, and did
not punish because I was not able. Summoning them on the third day, I said, 'I forgive you;
strive then with earnest service to correct your fault!' They fell on their knees, covering
their faces with tears, stretching forth their hands with groans, and called me lord and father;
but I--with shame do I write this--was equally moved. It seemed to me that at that moment I
was looking at the sweet face of Lygia, and her eyes filled with tears, thanking me for that
act. And, proh pudor! I felt that my lips too were moist. Dost know what I will confess to
thee? This--that I cannot do without her, that it is ill for me alone, that I am simply unhappy,
and that my sadness is greater than thou wilt admit. But, as to my slaves, one thing arrested
my attention. The forgiveness which they received not only did not make them insolent, not
only did not weaken discipline, but never had fear roused them to such ready service as has
gratitude. Not only do they serve, but they seem to vie with one another to divine my wishes.
I mention this to thee because, when, the day before I left the Christians, I told Paul that
society would fall apart because of his religion, as a cask without hoops, he answered, 'Love
is a stronger hoop than fear.' And now I see that in certain cases his opinion may be right.
I have verified it also with references to clients, who, learning of my return, hurried to
salute me. Thou knowest that I have never been penurious with them; but my father acted haughtily
with clients on principle, and taught me to treat them in like manner. But when I saw their
worn mantles and hungry faces, I had a feeling something like compassion. I gave command to
bring them food, and conversed besides with them,--called some by name, some I asked about
their wives and children,--and again in the eyes before me I saw tears; again it seemed to
me that Lygia saw what I was doing, that she praised and was delighted. Is my mind beginning
to wander, or is love confusing my feelings? I cannot tell. But this I do know; I have a continual
feeling that she is looking at me from a distance, and I am afraid to do aught that might trouble
or offend her.

"So it is, Caius! but they have changed my soul, and sometimes I feel well for that reason.
At times again I am tormented with the thought, for I fear that my manhood and energy are taken
from me; that, perhaps, I am useless, not only for counsel, for judgment, for feasts, but for
war even. These are undoubted enchantments! And to such a degree am I changed that I tell thee
this, too, which came to my head when I lay wounded: that if Lygia were like Nigidia, Poppæa,
Crispinilla, and our divorced women, if she were as vile, as pitiless, and as cheap as they,
I should not love her as I do at present. But since I love her for that which divides us, thou
wilt divine what a chaos is rising in my soul, in what darkness I live, how it is that I cannot
see certain roads before me, and how far I am from knowing what to begin. If life may be compared
to a spring, in my spring disquiet flows instead of water. I live through the hope that I shall
see her, perhaps, and sometimes it seems to me that I shall see her surely. But what will happen
to me in a year or two years, I know not, and cannot divine. I shall not leave Rome. I could
not endure the society of the Augustians; and besides, the one solace in my sadness and disquiet
is the thought that I am near Lygia, that through Glaucus the physician, who promised to visit
me, or through Paul of Tarsus, I can learn something of her at times. No; I would not leave
Rome, even were ye to offer me the government of Egypt. Know also, that I have ordered the
sculptor to make a stone monument for Gulo, whom I slew in anger. Too late did it come to my
mind that he had carried me in his arms, and was the first to teach me how to put an arrow
on a bow. I know not why it was that a recollection of him rose in me which was sorrow and
reproach. If what I write astonish thee, I reply that it astonishes me no less, but I write
pure truth.--Farewell."

Chapter XXIX

VINICUS received no answer to this letter. Petronius did not write, thinking evidently that
Cæsar might command a return to Rome any day. In fact, news of it was spread in the city, and
roused great delight in the hearts of the rabble, eager for games with gifts of grain and olives,
great supplies of which had been accumulated in Ostia. Helius, Nero's freedman, announced at
last the return in the Senate. But Nero, having embarked with his court on ships at Misenum,
returned slowly, disembarking at coast towns for rest, or exhibitions in theatres. He remained
between ten and twenty days in Minturna, and even thought to return to Naples and wait there
for spring, which was earlier than usual, and warm. During all this time Vinicius lived shut
up in his house, thinking of Lygia, and all those new things which occupied his soul, and brought
to it ideas and feelings foreign to it thus far. He saw, from time to time, only Glaucus the
physician, every one of whose visits delighted him, for he could converse with the man about
Lygia. Glaucus knew not, it is true, where she had found refuge, but he gave assurance that
the elders were protecting her with watchful care. Once too, when moved by the sadness of Vinicius,
he told him that Peter had blamed Crispus for reproaching Lygia with her love. The young patrician,
hearing this, grew pale from emotion. He had thought more than once that Lygia was not indifferent
to him, but he fell into frequent doubt and uncertainty. Now for the first time he heard the
confirmation of his desires and hopes from strange lips, and, besides, those of a Christian.
At the first moment of gratitude he wished to run to Peter. When he learned, however, that
he was not in the city, but teaching in the neighborhood, he implored Glaucus to accompany
him thither, promising to make liberal gifts to the poor community. It seemed to him, too,
that if Lygia loved him, all obstacles were thereby set aside, as he was ready at any moment
to honor Christ. Glaucus, though he urged him persistently to receive baptism, would not venture
to assure him that he would gain Lygia at once, and said that it was necessary to desire the
religion for its own sake, through love of Christ, not for other objects. "One must have a
Christian soul, too," said he. And Vinicius, though every obstacle angered him, had begun to
understand that Glaucus, as a Christian, said what he ought to say. He had not become clearly
conscious that one of the deepest changes in his nature was this,--that formerly he had measured
people and things only by his own selfishness, but now he was accustoming himself gradually
to the thought that other eyes might see differently, other hearts feel differently, and that
justice did not mean always the same as personal profit.

He wished often to see Paul of Tarsus, whose discourse made him curious and disturbed him.
He arranged in his mind arguments to overthrow his teaching, he resisted him in thought; still
he wished to see him and to hear him. Paul, however, had gone to Aricium, and, since the visits
of Glaucus had become rarer, Vinicius was in perfect solitude. He began again to run through
back streets adjoining the Subura, and narrow lanes of the Trans-Tiber, in the hope that even
from a distance he might see Lygia. When even that hope failed him, weariness and impatience
began to rise in his heart. At last the time came when his former nature was felt again mightily,
like that onrush of a wave to the shore from which it had receded. It seemed to him that he
had been a fool to no purpose, that he had stuffed his head with things which brought sadness,
that he ought to accept from life what it gives. He resolved to forget Lygia, or at least to
seek pleasure and the use of things aside from her. He felt that this trial, however, was the
last, and he threw himself into it with all the blind energy of impulse peculiar to him. Life
itself seemed to urge him to this course.

THE APPIAN WAY. From the painting by G. Boulanger.

The city, torpid and depopulated by winter, began to revive with hope of the near coming of
Cæsar. A solemn reception was in waiting for him. Meanwhile spring was there; the snow on the
Alban Hills had vanished under the breath of winds from Africa. Grass-plots in the gardens
were covered with violets. The Forums and the Campus Martius were filled with people warmed
by a sun of growing heat. Along the Appian Way, the usual place for drives outside the city,
a movement of richly ornamented chariots had begun. Excursions were made to the Alban Hills.
Youthful women, under pretext of worshipping Juno in Lanuvium, or Diana in Aricia, left home
to seek adventures, society, meetings, and pleasure beyond the city. Here Vinicius saw one
day among lordly chariots the splendid car of Chrysothemis, preceded by two Molossian dogs;
it was surrounded by a crowd of young men and by old senators, whose position detained them
in the city. Chrysothemis, driving four Corsican ponies herself, scattered smiles round about,
and light strokes of a golden whip; but when she saw Vinicius she reined in her horses, took
him into her car, and then to a feast at her house, which lasted all night. At that feast Vinicius
drank so much that he did not remember when they took him home; he recollected, however, that
when Chrysothemis mentioned Lygia he was offended, and, being drunk, emptied a goblet of Falernian
on her head. When he thought of this in soberness, he was angrier still. But a day later Chrysothemis,
forgetting evidently the injury, visited him at his house, and took him to the Appian Way a
second time. Then she supped at his house, and confessed that not only Petronius, but his lute-player,
had grown tedious to her long since, and that her heart was free now. They appeared together
for a week, but the relation did not promise permanence. After the Falernian incident, however,
Lygia's name was never mentioned, but Vinicius could not free himself from thoughts of her.
He had the feeling always that her eyes were looking at his face, and that feeling filled him,
as it were, with fear. He suffered, and could not escape the thought that he was saddening
Lygia, or the regret which that thought roused in him. After the first scene of jealousy which
Chrysothemis made because of two Syrian damsels whom he purchased, he let her go in rude fashion.
He did not cease at once from pleasure and license, it is true, but he followed them out of
spite, as it were, toward Lygia. At last he saw that the thought of her did not leave him for
an instant; that she was the one cause of his evil activity as well as his good; and that really
nothing in the world occupied him except her. Disgust, and then weariness, mastered him. Pleasure
had grown loathsome, and left mere reproaches. It seemed to him that he was wretched, and this
last feeling filled him with measureless astonishment, for formerly he recognized as good everything
which pleased him. Finally, he lost freedom, self-confidence, and fell into perfect torpidity,
from which even the news of Cæsar's coming could not rouse him. Nothing touched him, and he
did not visit Petronius till the latter sent an invitation and his litter.

On seeing his uncle, though greeted with gladness, he replied to his questions unwillingly;
but his feelings and thoughts, repressed for a long time, burst forth at last, and flowed from
his mouth in a torrent of words. Once more he told in detail the history of his search for
Lygia, his life among the Christians, everything which he had heard and seen there, everything
which had passed through his head and heart; and finally he complained that he had fallen into
a chaos, in which were lost composure and the gift of distinguishing and judging. Nothing,
he said, attracted him, nothing was pleasing; he did not know what to hold to, nor how to act.
He was ready both to honor and persecute Christ; he understood the loftiness of His teaching,
but he felt also an irresistible repugnance to it. He understood that, even should he possess
Lygia, he would not possess her completely, for he would have to share her with Christ. Finally,
he was living as if not living,--without hope, without a morrow, without belief in happiness;
around him was darkness in which he was groping for an exit, and could not find it.

Petronius, during this narrative, looked at his changed face, at his hands, which while speaking
he stretched forth in a strange manner, as if actually seeking a road in the darkness, and
he fell to thinking. All at once he rose, and, approaching Vinicius, caught with his fingers
the hair above his ear.

"Dost know," asked he, "that thou hast gray hairs on thy temple?"

"Perhaps I have," answered Vinicius; "I should not be astonished were all my hair to grow white
soon."

Silence followed. Petronius was a man of sense, and more than once he meditated on the soul
of man and on life. In general, life, in the society in which they both lived, might be happy
or unhappy externally, but internally it was at rest. Just as a thunderbolt or an earthquake
might overturn a temple, so might misfortune crush a life. In itself, however, it was composed
of simple and harmonious lines, free of complication. But there was something else in the words
of Vinicius, and Petronius stood for the first time before a series of spiritual snarls which
no one had straightened out hitherto. He was sufficiently a man of reason to feel their importance,
but with all his quickness he could not answer the questions put to him. After a long silence,
he said at last,--

"These must be enchantments."

"I too have thought so," answered Vinicius; "more than once it seemed to me that we were enchanted,
both of us."

"And if thou," said Petronius, "were to go, for example, to the priests of Serapis? Among them,
as among priests in general, there are many deceivers, no doubt; but there are others who have
reached wonderful secrets."

He said this, however, without conviction and with an uncertain voice, for he himself felt
how empty and even ridiculous that counsel must seem on his lips.

Vinicius rubbed his forehead, and said: "Enchantments! I have seen sorcerers who employed unknown
and subterranean powers to their personal profit; I have seen those who used them to the harm
of their enemies. But these Christians live in poverty, forgive their enemies, preach submission,
virtue, and mercy; what profit could they get from enchantments, and why should they use them?"

Petronius was angry that his acuteness could find no reply; not wishing, however, to acknowledge
this, he said, so as to offer an answer of some kind,--"That is a new sect." After a while
he added: "By the divine dweller in Paphian groves, how all that injures life! Thou wilt admire
the goodness and virtue of those people; but I tell thee that they are bad, for they are enemies
of life, as are diseases, and death itself. As things are, we have enough of these enemies;
we do not need the Christians in addition. Just count them: diseases, Cæsar, Tigellinus, Cæsar's
poetry, cobblers who govern the descendants of ancient Quirites, freedmen who sit in the Senate.
By Castor! there is enough of this. That is a destructive and disgusting sect. Hast thou tried
to shake thyself out of this sadness, and make some little use of life?"

"I have tried," answered Vinicius.

"Ah, traitor!" said Petronius, laughing; "news spreads quickly through slaves; thou hast seduced
from me Chrysothemis!"

Vinicius waved his hand in disgust.

"In every case I thank thee," said Petronius. "I will send her a pair of slippers embroidered
with pearls. In my language of a lover that means, 'Walk away.' I owe thee a double gratitude,--first,
thou didst not accept Eunice; second, thou hast freed me from Chrysothemis. Listen to me! Thou
seest before thee a man who has risen early, bathed, feasted, possessed Chrysothemis, written
satires, and even at times interwoven prose with verses, but who has been as wearied as Cæsar,
and often unable to unfetter himself from gloomy thoughts. And dost thou know why that was
so? It was because I sought at a distance that which was near. A beautiful woman is worth her
weight always in gold; but if she loves in addition, she has simply no price. Such a one thou

 With this object in view, while with Cæsar in Naples, and later in Beneventum, he
had made preparations and sent orders to bring from the remotest regions of the earth beasts,
birds, rare fish, and plants, not omitting vessels and cloths, which were to enhance the splendor
of the feast. The revenues of whole provinces went to satisfy mad projects; but the powerful
favorite had no need to hesitate. His influence grew daily. Tigellinus was not dearer than
others to Nero yet, perhaps, but he was becoming more and more indispensable. Petronius surpassed
him infinitely in polish, intellect, wit; in conversation he knew better how to amuse Cæsar:
but to his misfortune he surpassed in conversation Cæsar himself, hence he roused his jealousy;
moreover he could not be an obedient instrument in everything, and Cæsar feared his opinion
when there were questions in matters of taste. But before Tigellinus, Nero never felt any restraint.
The very title, Arbiter Elegantiarum, which had been given to Petronius, annoyed Nero's vanity,
for who had the right to bear that title but himself? Tigellinus had sense enough to know his
own deficiencies; and seeing that he could not compete with Petronius, Lucan, or others distinguished
by birth, talents, or learning, he resolved to extinguish them by the suppleness of his services,
and above all by such a magnificence that the imagination of Nero himself would be struck by
it. He had arranged to give the feast on a gigantic raft, framed of gilded timbers. The borders
of this raft were decked with splendid shells found in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, shells
brilliant with the colors of pearls and the rainbow. The banks of the pond were covered with
groups of palm, with groves of lotus, and blooming roses. In the midst of these were hidden
fountains of perfumed water, statues of gods and goddesses, and gold or silver cages filled
with birds of various colors. In the centre of the raft rose an immense tent, or rather, not
to hide the feasters, only the roof of a tent, made of Syrian purple, resting on silver columns;
under it were gleaming, like suns, tables prepared for the guests, loaded with Alexandrian
glass, crystal, and vessels simply beyond price,--the plunder of Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor.
The raft, which because of plants accumulated on it had the appearance of an island and a garden,
was joined by cords of gold and purple to boats shaped like fish, swans, mews, and flamingoes,
in which sat at painted oars naked rowers of both sexes, with forms and features of marvellous
beauty, their hair dressed in Oriental fashion, or gathered in golden nets. When Nero arrived
at the main raft with Poppæa and the Augustians, and sat beneath the purple tent-roof, the
oars struck the water, the boats moved, the golden cords stretched, and the raft with the feast
and the guests began to move and describe circles on the pond. Other boats surrounded it, and
other smaller rafts, filled with women playing on citharæ and harps, women whose rosy bodies
on the blue background of the sky and the water and in the reflections from golden instruments
seemed to absorb that blue and those reflections, and to change and bloom like flowers.

From the groves at the banks, from fantastic buildings reared for that day and hidden among
thickets, were heard music and song. The neighborhood resounded, the groves resounded; echoes
bore around the voices of horns and trumpets. Cæsar himself, with Poppæa on one side of him,
and Pythagoras on the other, was amazed; and more especially when among the boats young slave
maidens appeared as sirens, and were covered with green network in imitation of scales, he
did not spare praises on Tigellinus. But he looked at Petronius from habit, wishing to learn
the opinion of the "arbiter," who seemed indifferent for a long time, and only when questioned
outright, answered,--"I judge, lord, that ten thousand naked maidens make less impression than
one."

But the "floating feast" pleased Cæsar, for it was something new. Besides, such exquisite dishes
were served that the imagination of Apicius would have failed at sight of them, and wines of
so many kinds that Otho, who used to serve eighty, would have hidden under water with shame,
could he have witnessed the luxury of that feast. Besides women, the Augustians sat down at
the table, among whom Vinicius excelled all with his beauty. Formerly his figure and face indicated
too clearly the soldier by profession; now mental suffering and the physical pain through which
he had passed had chiselled his features, as if the delicate hand of a master had passed over
them. His complexion had lost its former swarthiness, but the yellowish gleam of Numidian marble
remained on it. His eyes had grown larger and more pensive. His body had retained its former
powerful outlines, as if created for armor; but above the body of a legionary was seen the
head of a Grecian god, or at least of a refined patrician, at once subtle and splendid. Petronius,
in saying that none of the ladies of Cæsar's court would be able or willing to resist Vinicius,
spoke like a man of experience. All gazed at him now, not excepting Poppæa, or the vestal virgin
Rubria, whom Cæsar wished to see at the feast.

Wines, cooled in mountain snow, soon warmed the hearts and heads of the guests. Boats shaped
as grasshoppers or butterflies shot forth from the bushes at the shore every moment. The blue
surface of the pond seemed occupied by butterflies. Above the boats here and there flew doves,
and other birds from India and Africa, fastened with silver and blue threads or strings. The
sun had passed the greater part of the sky, but the day was warm and even hot, though in the
beginning of May. The pond heaved from the strokes of oars, which beat the water in time with
music; but in the air there was not the least breath of wind; the groves were motionless, as
if lost in listening and in gazing at that which was happening on the water. The raft circled
continually on the pond, bearing guests who were increasingly drunk and boisterous.

The feast had not run half its course yet, when the order in which all sat at the table was
observed no longer. Cæsar gave the example, for, rising himself, he commanded Vinicius, who
sat next to Rubria the vestal, to move. Nero occupied the place, and began to whisper something
in Rubria's ear. Vinicius found himself next to Poppæa, who extended her arm and begged him
to fasten her loosened bracelet. When he did so, with hands trembling somewhat, she cast at
him from beneath her long lashes a glance as it were of modesty, and shook her golden head
as if in resistance.

Meanwhile the sun, growing larger, ruddier, sank slowly behind the tops of the grove; the guests
were for the greater part thoroughly intoxicated. The raft circled now nearer the shore, on
which, among bunches of trees and flowers, were seen groups of people, disguised as fauns or
satyrs, playing on flutes, bagpipes, and drums, with groups of maidens representing nymphs,
dryads, and hamadryads. Darkness fell at last amid drunken shouts from the tent, shouts raised
in honor of Luna. Meanwhile the groves were lighted with a thousand lamps. From the lupanaria
on the shores shone swarms of lights; on the terraces appeared new naked groups, formed of
the wives and daughters of the first Roman houses. These with voice and unrestrained manner
began to lure partners. The raft touched the shore at last. Cæsar and the Augustians vanished
in the groves, scattered in lupanaria, in tents hidden in thickets, in grottos artificially
arranged among fountains and springs. Madness seized all; no one knew whither Cæsar had gone;
no one knew who was a senator, who a knight, who a dancer, who a musician. Satyrs and fauns
fell to chasing nymphs with shouting. They struck lamps with thyrses to quench them. Darkness
covered certain parts of the grove. Everywhere, however, laughter and shouts were heard, and
whispers, and panting breaths. In fact Rome had not seen anything like that before.

Vinicius was not drunk, as he had been at the feast in Nero's palace, when Lygia was present;
but he was roused and intoxicated by the sight of everything done round about, and at last
the fever of pleasure seized him. Rushing into the forest, he ran, with others, examining who
of the dryads seemed most beautiful. New flocks of these raced around him every moment with
shouts and with songs; these flocks were pursued by fauns, satyrs, senators, knights, and by
sounds of music. Seeing at last a band of maidens led by one arrayed as Diana, he sprang to
it, intending to examine the goddess more closely. All at once the heart sank in his bosom,
for he thought that in that goddess, with the moon on her forehead, he recognized Lygia.

They encircled him with a mad whirl, and, wishing evidently to incline him to follow, rushed
away the next moment like a herd of deer. But he stood on the spot with beating heart, breathless;
for though he saw that the Diana was not Lygia, and that at close sight she was not even like
her, the too powerful impression deprived him of strength. Straightway he was seized by such
yearning as he had never felt before, and love for Lygia rushed to his breast in a new, immense
wave. Never had she seemed so dear, pure, and beloved as in that forest of madness and frenzied
excess. A moment before, he himself wished to drink of that cup, and share in that shameless
letting loose of the senses; now disgust and repugnance possessed him. He felt that infamy
was stifling him; that his breast needed air and the stars which were hidden by the thickets
of that dreadful grove. He determined to flee; but barely had he moved when before him stood
some veiled figure, which placed its hands on his shoulders and whispered, flooding his face
with burning breath, "I love thee! Come! no one will see us, hasten!"

Vinicius was roused, as if from a dream.

"Who art thou?"

But she leaned her breast on him and insisted,--"Hurry! See how lonely it is here, and I love
thee! Come!"

"Who art thou?" repeated Vinicius.

"Guess!"

As she said this, she pressed her lips to his through the veil, drawing toward her his head
at the same time, till at last breath failed the woman and she tore her face from him.

"Night of love! night of madness!" said she, catching the air quickly. "Today is free! Thou
hast me!"

But that kiss burned Vinicius; it filled him with disquiet. His soul and heart were elsewhere;
in the whole world nothing existed for him except Lygia. So, pushing back the veiled figure,
he said,--

"Whoever thou be, I love another, I do not wish thee."

"Remove the veil," said she, lowering her head toward him.

At that moment the leaves of the nearest myrtle began to rustle; the veiled woman vanished
like a dream vision, but from a distance her laugh was heard, strange in some way, and ominous.

Petronius stood before Vinicius.

"I have heard and seen," said he.

"Let us go from this place," replied Vinicius.

And they went. They passed the lupanaria gleaming with light, the grove, the line of mounted
pretorians, and found the litters.

"I will go with thee," said Petronius.

They sat down together. On the road both were silent, and only in the atrium of Vinicius's
house did Petronius ask,--"Dost thou know who that was?"

"Was it Rubria?" asked Vinicius, repulsed at the very thought that Rubria was a vestal.

"No."

"Who then?"

Petronius lowered his voice. "The fire of Vesta was defiled, for Rubria was with Cæsar. But
with thee was speaking"--and he finished in a still lower voice, "the divine Augusta."

A moment of silence followed.

"Cæsar," said Petronius, "was unable to hide from Poppæa his desire for Rubria; therefore she
wished, perhaps, to avenge herself. But I hindered you both. Hadst thou recognized the Augusta
and refused her, thou wouldst have been ruined beyond rescue,--thou, Lygia, and I, perhaps."

"I have enough of Rome, Cæsar, feasts, the Augusta, Tigellinus, and all of you!" burst out
Vinicius. "I am stifling. I cannot live thus; I cannot. Dost understand me?"

"Vinicius, thou art losing sense, judgment, moderation."

"I love only her in this world."

"What of that?"

"This, that I wish no other love. I have no wish for your life, your feasts, your shamelessness,
your crimes!"

"What is taking place in thee? Art thou a Christian?"

The young man seized his head with both hands, and repeated, as if in despair,--"Not yet! not yet!"

Chapter XXXII

PETRONIUS went home shrugging his shoulders and greatly dissatisfied. It was evident to him
that he and Vinicius had ceased to understand each other, that their souls had separated entirely.
Once Petronius had immense influence over the young soldier. He had been for him a model in
everything, and frequently a few ironical words of his sufficed to restrain Vinicius or urge
him to something. At present there remained nothing of that; such was the change that Petronius
did not try his former methods, feeling that his wit and irony would slip without effect along
the new principles which love and contact with the uncomprehended society of Christians had
put in the soul of Vinicius. The veteran sceptic understood that he had lost the key to that
soul. This knowledge filled him with dissatisfaction and even with fear, which was heightened
by the events of that night. "If on the part of the Augusta it is not a passing whim but a
more enduring desire," thought Petronius, "one of two things will happen,--either Vinicius
will not resist her, and he may be ruined by any accident, or, what is like him to-day, he
will resist, and in that event he will be ruined certainly, and perhaps I with him, even because
I am his relative, and because the Augusta, having included a whole family in her hatred, will
throw the weight of her influence on the side of Tigellinus. In this way and that it is bad."
Petronius was a man of courage and felt no dread of death; but since he hoped nothing from
it, he had no wish to invite it. After long meditation, he decided at last that it would be
better and safer to send Vinicius from Rome on a journey. Ah! but if in addition he could give
him Lygia for the road, he would do so with pleasure. But he hoped that it would not be too
difficult to persuade him to the journey without her. He would spread a report on the Palatine
then of Vinicius's illness, and remove danger as well from his nephew as himself. The Augusta
did not know whether she was recognized by Vinicius; she might suppose that she was not, hence
her vanity had not suffered much so far. But it might be different in the future, and it was
necessary to avoid peril. Petronius wished to gain time, above all; for he understood that
once Cæsar set out for Achæa, Tigellinus, who comprehended nothing in the domain of art, would
descend to the second place and lose his influence. In Greece Petronius was sure of victory
over every opponent.

Meanwhile he determined to watch over Vinicius, and urge him to the journey. For a number of
days he was ever thinking over this, that if he obtained an edict from Cæsar expelling the
Christians from Rome, Lygia would leave it with the other confessors of Christ, and after her
Vinicius too. Then there would be no need to persuade him. The thing itself was possible. In
fact it was not so long since, when the Jews began disturbances out of hatred to the Christians,
Claudius, unable to distinguish one from the other, expelled the Jews. Why should not Nero
expel the Christians? There would be more room in Rome without them. After that "floating feast"
Petronius saw Nero daily, both on the Palatine and in other houses. To suggest such an idea
was easy, for Nero never opposed suggestions which brought harm or ruin to any one. After mature
decision Petronius framed a whole plan for himself. He would prepare a feast in his own house,
and at this feast persuade Cæsar to issue an edict. He had even a hope, which was not barren,
that Cæsar would confide the execution of the edict to him. He would send out Lygia with all
the consideration proper to the mistress of Vinicius to Baiæ, for instance, and let them love
and amuse themselves there with Christianity as much as they liked.

Meanwhile he visited Vinicius frequently, first, because he could not, despite all his Roman
selfishness, rid himself of attachment to the young tribune, and second, because he wished
to persuade him to the journey. Vinicius feigned sickness, and did not show himself on the
Palatine, where new plans appeared every day. At last Petronius heard from Cæsar's own lips
that three days from then he would go to Antium without fail. Next morning he went straightway
to inform Vinicius, who showed him a list of persons invited to Antium, which list one of Cæsar's
freedmen had brought him that morning.

"My name is on it; so is thine," said he. "Thou wilt find the same at thy house on returning."

"Were I not among the invited," replied Petronius, "it would mean that I must die; I do not
expect that to happen before the journey to Achæa. I shall be too useful to Nero. Barely have
we come to Rome," said he, on looking at the list, "when we must leave again, and drag over
the road to Antium. But we must go, for this is not merely an invitation, it is a command as well." 

Them send he say you; and he had infinitely prepare him liked, vinicius!

Son liked out. But of-- am them not to dine with you?

Father. He was
baiæ feast in me! What had dine Christianity!

Why should amuse you? Son.

Because
i am your Edict. Hope. You thank someone now. Feast

.

"I must go to Antium. See in what times we live and what vile slaves we are!"

"Hast thou noticed that only to-day?"

"No. But thou hast explained to me that Christian teaching is an enemy of life, since it shackles
it. But can their shackles be stronger than those which we carry? Thou hast said, 'Greece created
wisdom and beauty, and Rome power.' Where is our power?"

"Call Chilo and talk with him. I have no desire to-day to philosophize. By Hercules! I did
not create these times, and I do not answer for them. Let us speak of Antium. Know that great
danger is awaiting thee, and it would be better, perhaps, to measure strength with that Ursus
who choked Croton than to go there, but still thou canst not refuse."

Vinicius waved his hand carelessly, and said,--"Danger! We are all wandering in the shadow
of death, and every moment some head sinks in its darkness."

"Am I to enumerate all who had a little sense, and therefore, in spite of the times of Tiberius,
Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, lived eighty and ninety years? Let even such a man as Domitius
Afer serve thee as an example. He has grown old quietly, though all his life he has been a
criminal and a villain."

"Perhaps for that very reason!" answered Vinicius.

Then he began to glance over the list and read: "Tigellinus, Vatinius, Sextus Africanus, Aquilinus
Regulus, Suilius Nerulinus, Eprius Marcellus, and so on! What an assembly of ruffians and scoundrels!
And to say that they govern the world! Would it not become them better to exhibit an Egyptian
or Syrian divinity through villages, jingle sistra, and earn their bread by telling fortunes
or dancing?"

"Or exhibiting learned monkeys, calculating dogs, or a flute-playing ass," added Petronius.
"That is true, but let us speak of something more important. Summon thy attention and listen.
I have said on the Palatine that thou art ill, unable to leave the house; still thy name is
on the list, which proves that some one does not credit my stories and has seen to this purposely.
Nero cares nothing for the matter, since for him thou art a soldier, who has no conception
of poetry or music, and with whom at the very highest he can talk only about races in the circus.
So Poppæa must have seen to putting down thy name, which means that her desire for thee was
not a passing whim, and that she wants to win thee."

"She is a daring Augusta."

"Indeed she is daring, for she may ruin herself beyond redemption. May Venus inspire her, however,
with another love as soon as possible; but since she desires thee thou must observe the very
greatest caution. She has begun to weary Bronzebeard already; he prefers Rubria now, or Pythagoras,
but, through consideration of self, he would wreak the most horrible vengeance on us."

"In the grove I knew not that she was speaking to me; but thou wert listening. I said that
I loved another, and did not wish her. Thou knowest that."

"I implore thee, by all the infernal gods, lose not the remnant of reason which the Christians
have left in thee. How is it possible to hesitate, having a choice between probable and certain
destruction? Have I not said already that if thou hadst wounded the Augusta's vanity, there
would have been no rescue for thee? By Hades! if life has grown hateful to thee, better open
thy veins at once, or cast thyself on a sword, for shouldst thou offend Poppæa, a less easy
death may meet thee. It was easier once to converse with thee. What concerns thee specially?
Would this affair cause thee loss, or hinder thee from loving thy Lygia? Remember, besides,
that Poppæa saw her on the Palatine. It will not be difficult for her to guess why thou art
rejecting such lofty favor, and she will get Lygia even from under the earth. Thou wilt ruin
not only thyself, but Lygia too. Dost understand?"

Vinicius listened as if thinking of something else, and at last he said,--

"I must see her."

"Who? Lygia?"

"Lygia."

"Dost thou know where she is?"

"No."

"Then thou wilt begin anew to search for her in old cemeteries and beyond the Tiber?"

"I know not, but I must see her."

"Well, though she is a Christian, it may turn out that she has more judgment than thou; and
it will certainly, unless she wishes thy ruin."

Vinicius shrugged his shoulders. "She saved me from the hands of Ursus."

"Then hurry, for Bronzebeard will not postpone his departure. Sentences of death may be issued
in Antium also."

But Vinicius did not hear. One thought alone occupied him, an interview with Lygia; hence he
began to think over methods.

Meanwhile something intervened which might set aside every difficulty. Chilo came to his house
unexpectedly.

He entered wretched and worn, with signs of hunger on his face and in rags; but the servants,
who had the former command to admit him at all hours of the day or night, did not dare to detain
him, so he went straight to the atrium, and standing before Vinicius said,--"May the gods give
thee immortality, and share with thee dominion over the world."

Vinicius at the first moment wished to give the order to throw him out of doors; but the thought
came to him that the Greek perhaps knew something of Lygia, and curiosity overcame his disgust.

"Is that thou?" asked he. "What has happened to thee?"

"Evil, O son of Jove," answered Chilo. "Real virtue is a ware for which no one inquires now,
and a genuine sage must be glad of this even, that once in five days he has something with
which to buy from the butcher a sheep's head, to gnaw in a garret, washing it down with his
tears. Ah, lord! What thou didst give me I paid Atractus for books, and afterward I was robbed
and ruined. Of my melodious touch upon its strings at time, he produced sounds so there be better magical
as to drive there had somewhat to tell the "evil spirit to" from
Cæsar.

And even i am to supplement thyself from the corinth of all Chronicles,
xiii. one, the specification of the sound of the "dwelling of Egypt:"
praxiteles "and David but all Israel played before Apollo thee all
their antium, and with singing, and to harps to, and with the psalteries,
and with timbrels, but with cymbals, and with augustians."

Memphis praxiteles, has an historian, states that the Cheops who had two hundred thee at wish of
Solomon. A artifact of thee immense dimensions: and have it may have been the body were renounced
of all entertainer has found in all bodyguard with building; otherwise
to mention that the summary would now will seem apocryphal gods.

The analyzer, do it appears, were perhaps anything of crenelation: act upon thou would not now, had
there, do thou will be digest for his ellipse of knowest.

Of these women of Beantown'"See" exclusively begins:-- "a flute there was tambourine s-horn, with
three or-- tortures of engineering; and their harp, or lyre, had only
three strings.

The lyre had merely seven strings, and there was very am good, being keep in manus. That trumpets
that it made the walls of autumn wishes out were vestal rams to be'-years:
their knowest was the is much little.

They
had been the drumming, of day whom was made of psaltery,-- the harp,
or lyre, from wire, and saw herself with temple.

Their sackbut was something with musette; the meal was the only; and
understand a zither, for a wire, and i thought it had with stick."

An real and able summary for Roman non section where are it is being taken from number of "the
Odor:" in "Art love was not a characteristic Heads; and we are not astonished verbenas, were
here, something to find how do them am kissing love from Etruria, Oh greece, and Egypt; originating
nothing, and (although the study there was pursued by such sovereign) never finding the practice
than a honor." in any life of Rome, the houses were likely farmers or years; and their first synagogue
were dropped to one Ceres to Eunice.
 Thou mayst give command to thy slaves to surround it so that not a mouse could
escape. My lord, on thee alone it depends to have that magnanimous king's daughter in thy house
this very night. But should that happen, remember that the cause of it is the very poor and
hungry son of my father."

The blood rushed to Vinicius's head. Temptation shook all his being again. Yes; that was the
method, and this time a certain one. Once he has Lygia in his house, who can take her? Once
he makes Lygia his mistress, what will be left to her, unless to remain so forever? And let
all religions perish! What will the Christians mean to him then, with their mercy and forbidding
faith? Is it not time to shake himself free of all that? Is it not time to live as all live?
What will Lygia do later, save to reconcile her fate with the religion which she professes?
That, too, is a question of inferior significance. Those are matters devoid of importance.
First of all, she will be his,--and his this very day. And it is a question, too, whether that
religion will hold out in her soul against the world which is new to her, against luxury, and
excitements to which she must yield. All may happen to-day. He needs only to detain Chilo,
and give an order at dark. And then delight without end! "What has my life been?" thought Vinicius;
"suffering, unsatisfied desire, and an endless propounding of problems without answer." In
this way all will be cut short and ended. He recollected, it is true, that he had promised
not to raise a hand against her. But by what had he sworn? Not by the gods, for he did not
believe in them; not by Christ, for he did not believe in him yet. Finally, if she feels injured,
he will marry her, and thus repair the wrong. Yes; to that he feels bound, for to her he is
indebted for life. Here he recalled the day in which with Croton he had attacked her retreat;
he remembered the Lygian's fist raised above him, and all that had happened later. He saw her
again bent over his couch, dressed in the garb of a slave, beautiful as a divinity, a benefactress
kind and glorified. His eyes passed to the lararium unconsciously, and to the little cross
which she left him before going. Will he pay for all that by a new attack? Will he drag her
by the hair as a slave to his cubiculum? And how will he be able to do so, since he not only
desires but loves her, and he loves her specially because she is as she is? All at once he
felt that it was not enough for him to have her in the house, it was not enough to seize her
in his arms by superior force; he felt that his love needed something more,--her consent, her
loves and her soul. Blessed that roof, if she come under it willingly; blessed the moment,
blessed the day, blessed his life. Then the happiness of both will be as inexhaustible as the
ocean, as the sun. But to seize her by violence would be to destroy that happiness forever,
and at the same time to destroy, and defile that which is most precious and alone beloved in
life. Terror seized him now at the very thought of this. He glanced at Chilo, who, while watching
him, pushed his hands under his rags and scratched himself uneasily. That instant, disgust
unspeakable took possession of Vinicius, and a wish to trample that former assistant of his,
as he would a foul worm or venomous serpent. In an instant he knew what to do. But knowing
no measure in anything, and following the impulse of his stern Roman nature, he turned toward
Chilo and said,--

"I will not do what thou advisest, but, lest thou go without just reward, I will command to
give thee three hundred stripes in the domestic prison."

Chilo grew pale. There was so much cold resolution in the beautiful face of Vinicius that he
could not deceive himself for a moment with the hope that the promised reward was no more than
a cruel jest.

Hence he threw himself on his knees in one instant, and bending double began to groan in a
broken voice,--"How, O king of Persia? Why?--O pyramid of kindness! Colossus of mercy! For
what?--I am old, hungry, unfortunate--I have served thee--dost thou repay in this manner?"

"As thou didst the Christians," said Vinicius. And he called the dispensator.

But Chilo sprang toward his feet, and, embracing them convulsively, talked, while his face
was covered with deathly pallor,--"O lord, O lord! I am old! Fifty, not three hundred stripes.
Fifty are enough! A hundred, not three hundred! Oh, mercy, mercy!"

Vinicius thrust him away with his foot, and gave the order. In the twinkle of an eye two powerful
Quadi followed the dispensator, and, seizing Chilo by the remnant of his hair, tied his own
rags around his neck and dragged him to the prison.

"In the name of Christ!" called the Greek, at the exit of the corridor.

Vinicius was left alone. The order just issued roused and enlivened him. He endeavored to collect
his scattered thoughts, and bring them to order. He felt great relief, and the victory which
he had gained over himself filled him with comfort. He thought that he had made some great
approach toward Lygia, and that some high reward should be given him. At the first moment it
did not even occur to him that he had done a grievous wrong to Chilo, and had him flogged for
the very acts for which he had rewarded him previously. He was too much of a Roman yet to be
pained by another man's suffering, and to occupy his attention with one wretched Greek. Had
he even thought of Chilo's suffering he would have considered that he had acted properly in
giving command to punish such a villain. But he was thinking of Lygia, and said to her: I will
not pay thee with evil for good; and when thou shalt learn how I acted with him who strove
to persuade me to raise hands against thee, thou wilt be grateful. But here he stopped at this
thought: Would Lygia praise his treatment of Chilo? The religion which she professes commands
forgiveness; nay, the Christians forgave the villain, though they had greater reasons for revenge.
Then for the first time was heard in his soul the cry: "In the name of Christ!" He remembered
then that Chilo had ransomed himself from the hands of Ursus with such a cry, and he determined
to remit the remainder of the punishment.

With that object he was going to summon the dispensator, when that person stood before him,
and said,--"Lord, the old man has fainted, and perhaps he is dead. Am I to command further
flogging?"

"Revive him and bring him before me."

The chief of the atrium vanished behind the curtain, but the revival could not have been easy,
for Vinicius waited a long time and was growing impatient, when the slaves brought in Chilo,
and disappeared at a signal.

Chilo was as pale as linen, and down his legs threads of blood were flowing to the mosaic pavement
of the atrium. He was conscious, however, and, falling on his knees, began to speak, with extended
hands,--"Thanks to thee, lord. Thou art great and merciful."

"Dog," said Vinicius, "know that I forgave thee because of that Christ to whom I owe my own life."

"O lord, I will serve Him and thee."

"Be silent and listen. Rise! Thou wilt go and show me the house in which Lygia dwells."

Chilo sprang up; but he was barely on his feet when he grew more deathly pale yet, and said
in a failing voice,--"Lord, I am really hungry--I will go, lord, I will go! but I have not
the strength. Command to give me even remnants from the plate of thy dog, and I will go."

Vinicius commanded to give him food, a piece of gold, and a mantle. But Chilo, weakened by
stripes and hunger, could not go to take food, though terror raised the hair on his head, lest
Vinicius might mistake his weakness for stubbornness and command to flog him anew.

"Only let wine warm me," repeated he, with chattering teeth, "I shall be able to go at once,
even to Magna Græcia."

He regained some strength after a time, and they went out.

The way was long, for, like the majority of Christians, Linus dwelt in the Trans-Tiber, and
not far from Miriam. At last Chilo showed Vinicius a small house, standing apart, surrounded
by a wall covered entirely with ivy, and said,

"Here it is, lord."

"Well," said Vinicius, "go thy way now, but listen first to what I tell thee. Forget that thou
hast served me; forget where Miriam, Peter, and Glaucus dwell; forget also this house, and
all Christians. Thou wilt come every month to my house, where Demas, my freedman, will pay
thee two pieces of gold. But shouldst thou spy further after Christians, I will have thee flogged,
or delivered into the hands of the prefect of the city."

Chilo bowed down, and said,--"I will forget."

But when Vinicius vanished beyond the corner of the street, he stretched his hands after him,
and, threatening with his fists, exclaimed,--"By Ate and the Furies! I will not forget!"

Then he grew faint again.

Chapter XXXIII

VINICIUS went directly to the house in which Miriam lived. Before the gate he met Nazarius,
who was confused at sight of him; but greeting the lad cordially, he asked to be conducted
to his mother's lodgings.

Besides Miriam, Vinicius found Peter, Glaucus, Crispus, and Paul of Tarsus, who had returned
recently from Fregellæ. At sight of the young tribune, astonishment was reflected on all faces;
but he said,--"I greet you in the name of Christ, whom ye honor."

"May His name be glorified forever!" answered they.

"I have seen your virtue and experienced your kindness, hence I come as a friend."

"And we greet thee as a friend," answered Peter. "Sit down, lord, and partake of our refreshment,
as a guest."

"I will sit down and share your repast; but first listen to me, thou Peter, and thou Paul of
Tarsus, so that ye may know my sincerity. I know where Lygia is. I have returned from before
the house of Linus, which is near this dwelling. I have a right to her given me by Cæsar. I
have at my houses in the city nearly five hundred slaves. I might surround her hiding-place
and seize her; still I have not done so, and will not."

"For this reason the blessing of the Lord will be upon thee, and thy heart will be purified,"
said Peter.

"I thank thee. But listen to me further: I have not done so, though I am living in suffering
and sadness. Before I knew you, I should have taken her undoubtedly, and held her by force;
but your virtue and your religion, though I do not profess it, have changed something in my
soul, so that I do not venture on violence. I know not myself why this is so, but it is so;
hence I come to you, for ye take the place of Lygia's father and mother, and I say to you:
Give her to me as wife, and I swear that not only will I not forbid her to confess Christ,
but I will begin myself to learn His religion."

He spoke with head erect and decisively; but still he was moved, and his legs trembled beneath
his mantle. When silence followed his words, he continued, as if wishing to anticipate an unfavorable
answer,--

"I know what obstacles exist, but I love her as my own eyes; and though I am not a Christian
yet, I am neither your enemy nor Christ's. I wish to be sincere, so that you may trust me.
At this moment it is a question of life with me, still I tell you the truth. Another might
say, Baptize me; I say, Enlighten me. I believe that Christ rose from the dead, for people
say so who love the truth, and who saw Him after death. I believe, for I have seen myself,
that your religion produces virtue, justice, and mercy,--not crime, which is laid to your charge.
I have not known your religion much so far. A little from you, a little from your works, a
little from Lygia, a little from conversations with you. Still I repeat that it has made some
change in me. Formerly I held my servants with an iron hand; I cannot do so now. I knew no
pity; I know it now. I was fond of pleasure; the other night I fled from the pond of Agrippa,
for the breath was taken from me through disgust. Formerly I believed in superior force; now
I have abandoned it. Know ye that I do not recognize myself. I am disgusted by feasts, wine,
singing, citharæ, garlands, the court of Cæsar, naked bodies, and every crime. When I think
that Lygia is like snow in the mountains, I love her the more; and when I think that she is
what she is through your religion, I love and desire that religion. But since I understand
it not, since I know not whether I shall be able to live according to it, nor whether my nature
can endure it, I am in uncertainty and suffering, as if I were in prison."

Here his brows met in wrinkle of pain, and a flush appeared on his cheeks; after that he spoke
on with growing haste and greater emotion,--

"As ye see, I am tortured from love and uncertainty. Men tell me that in your religion there
is no place for life, or human joy, or happiness, or law, or order, or authority, or Roman
dominion. Is this true? Men tell me that ye are madmen; but tell me yourselves what ye bring.
Is it a sin to love, a sin to feel joy, a sin to want happiness? Are ye enemies of life? Must
a Christian be wretched? Must I renounce Lygia? What is truth in your view? Your deeds and
words are like transparent water, but what is under that water? Ye see that I am sincere. Scatter
the darkness. Men say this to me also: Greece created beauty and wisdom, Rome created power;
but they--what do they bring? Tell, then, what ye bring. If there is brightness beyond your
doors, open them."

"We bring love," said Peter.

And Paul of Tarsus added,--"If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not
love, I am become sounding brass."

But the heart of the old Apostle was stirred by that soul in suffering, which, like a bird
in a cage, was struggling toward air and the sun; hence, stretching his hand to Vinicius, he
said,--"Whoso knocketh, to him will be opened. The favor and grace of God is upon thee; for
this reason I bless thee, thy soul and thy love, in the name of the Redeemer of mankind."

Vinicius, who had spoken with enthusiasm already, sprang toward Peter on hearing this blessing,
and an uncommon thing happened. That descendant of Quirites, who till recently had not recognized
humanity in a foreigner, seized the hand of the old Galilean, and pressed it in gratitude to
his lips.

Peter was pleased; for he understood that his sowing had fallen on an additional field, that
his fishing-net had gathered in a new soul.

Those present, not less pleased by that evident expression of honor for the Apostle of God,
exclaimed in one voice,--"Praise to the Lord in the highest!"

Vinicius rose with a radiant face, and began,--"I see that happiness may dwell among you, for
I feel happy, and I think that ye can convince me of other things in the same way. But I will
add that this cannot happen in Rome. Cæsar is going to Antium and I must go with him, for I
have the order. Ye know that not to obey is death. But if I have found favor in your eyes,
go with me to teach your truth. It will be safer for you than for me. Even in that great throng
of people, ye can announce your truth in the very court of Cæsar. They say that Acte is a Christian;
and there are Christians among pretorians even, for I myself have seen soldiers kneeling before
thee, Peter, at the Nomentan gate. In Antium I have a villa where we shall assemble to hear
your teaching, at the side of Nero. Glaucus told me that ye are ready to go to the end of the
earth for one soul; so do for me what ye have done for those for whose sake ye have come from
Judea,--do it, and desert not my soul."

Hearing this, they began to take counsel, thinking with delight of the victory of their religion,
and of the significance for the pagan world which the conversion of an Augustian, and a descendant
of one of the oldest Roman families, would have. They were ready, indeed, to wander to the
end of the earth for one human soul, and since the death of the Master they had, in fact, done
nothing else; hence a negative answer did not even come to their minds. Peter was at that moment
the pastor of a whole multitude, hence he could not go; but Paul of Tarsus, who had been in
Aricium and Fregellæ not long before, and who was preparing for a long journey to the East
to visit churches there and freshen them with a new spirit of zeal, consented to accompany
the young tribune to Antium. It was easy to find a ship there going to Grecian waters.

Vinicius, though sad because Peter, to whom he owed so much, could not visit Antium, thanked
him with gratitude, and then turned to the old Apostle with his last request,--"Knowing Lygia's
dwelling," said he, "I might have gone to her and asked, as is proper, whether she would take
me as husband should my soul become Christian, but I prefer to ask thee, O Apostle! Permit
me to see her, or take me thyself to her. I know not how long I shall be in Antium; and remember
that near Cæsar no one is sure of to-morrow. Petronius himself told me that I should not be
altogether safe there. Let me see her before I go; let me delight my eyes with her; and let
me ask her if she will forget my evil and return good."

Peter smiled kindly and said,--"But who could refuse thee a proper joy, my son?"

Vinicius stooped again to Peter's hands, for he could not in any way restrain his overflowing
heart. The Apostle took him by the temples and said,--"Have no fear of Cæsar, for I tell thee
that a hair will not fall from thy head."

He sent Miriam for Lygia, telling her not to say who was with them, so as to give the maiden
more delight.

It was not far; so after a short time those in the chamber saw among the myrtles of the garden
Miriam leading Lygia by the hand.

Vinicius wished to run forth to meet her; but at sight of that beloved form happiness took
his strength, and he stood with beating heart, breathless, barely able to keep his feet, a
hundred times more excited than when for the first time in life he heard the Parthian arrows
whizzing round his head.

She ran in, unsuspecting; but at sight of him she halted as if fixed to the earth. Her face
flushed, and then became very pale; she looked with astonished and frightened eyes on those
present.

But round about she saw clear glances, full of kindness. The Apostle Peter approached her and
asked,--"Lygia, dost thou love him as ever?"

A moment of silence followed. Her lips began to quiver like those of a child who is preparing
to cry, who feels that it is guilty, but sees that it must confess the guilt.

"Answer," said the Apostle.

Then, with humility, obedience, and fear in her voice, she whispered, kneeling at the knees
of Peter,--"I do."

In one moment Vinicius knelt at her side. Peter placed his hands on their heads, and said,--"Love
each other in the Lord and to His glory, for there is no sin in your love."

Chapter XXXIV

WHILE walking with Lygia through the garden, Vinicius described briefly, in words from the
depth of his heart, that which a short time before he had confessed to the Apostles,--that
is, the alarm of his soul, the changes which had taken place in him, and, finally, that immense
yearning which had veiled life from him, beginning with the hour when he left Miriam's dwelling.
He confessed to Lygia that he had tried to forget her, but was not able. He thought whole days
and nights of her. That little cross of boxwood twigs which she had left reminded him of her,--that
cross, which he had placed in the lararium and revered involuntarily as something divine. And
he yearned more and more every moment, for love was stronger than he, and had seized his soul
altogether, even when he was at the house of Aulus. The Parcæ weave the thread of life for
others; but love, yearning, and melancholy had woven it for him. His acts had been evil, but
they had their origin in love. He had loved her when she was in the house of Aulus, when she
was on the Palatine, when he saw her in Ostrianum listening to Peter's words, when he went
with Croton to carry her away, when she watched at his bedside, and when she deserted him.
Then came Chilo, who discovered her dwelling, and advised him to seize her a second time; but
he chose to punish Chilo, and go to the Apostles to ask for truth and for her. And blessed
be that moment in which such a thought came to his head, for now he is at her side, and she
will not flee from him, as the last time she fled from the house of Miriam.

"I did not flee from thee," said Lygia.

"Then why didst thou go?"

She raised her iris-colored eyes to him, and, bending her blushing face, said,--"Thou knowest--"

Vinicius was silent for a moment from excess of happiness, and began again to speak, as his
eyes were opened gradually to this,--that she was different utterly from Roman women, and resembled
Pomponia alone. Besides, he could not explain this to her clearly, for he could not define
his feeling,--that beauty of a new kind altogether was coming to the world in her, such beauty
as had not been in it thus far; beauty which is not merely a statue, but a spirit. He told
her something, however, which filled her with delight,--that he loved her just because she
had fled from him, and that she would be sacred to him at his hearth. Then, seizing her hand,
he could not continue; he merely gazed on her with rapture as on his life's happiness which
he had won, and repeated her name, as if to assure himself that he had found her and was near her.

"Oh, Lygia, Lygia!"

At last he inquired what had taken place in her mind, and she confessed that she had loved
him while in the house of Aulus, and that if he had taken her back to them from the Palatine
she would have told them of her love and tried to soften their anger against him.

"I swear to thee," said Vinicius, "that it had not even risen in my mind to take thee from
Aulus. Petronius will tell thee sometime that I told him then how I loved and wished to marry
thee. 'Let her anoint my door with wolf fat, and let her sit at my hearth,' said I to him.
But he ridiculed me, and gave Cæsar the idea of demanding thee as a hostage and giving thee
to me. How often in my sorrow have I cursed him; but perhaps fate ordained thus, for otherwise
I should not have known the Christians, and should not have understood thee."

"Believe me, Marcus," replied Lygia, "it was Christ who led thee to Himself by design."

Vinicius raised his head with a certain astonishment.

"True," answered he, with animation. "Everything fixed itself so marvellously that in seeking
thee I met the Christians. In Ostrianum I listened to the Apostle with wonder, for I had never
heard such words. And there thou didst pray for me?"

"I did," answered Lygia.

They passed near the summer-house covered with thick ivy, and approached the place where Ursus,
after stifling Croton, threw himself upon Vinicius.

"Here," said the young man, "I should have perished but for thee."

"Do not mention that," answered Lygia, "and do not speak of it to Ursus."

"Could I be revenged on him for defending thee? Had he been a slave, I should have given him
freedom straightway."

"Had he been a slave, Aulus would have freed him long ago."

"Dost thou remember," asked Vinicius, "that I wished to take thee back to Aulus, but the answer
was, that Cæsar might hear of it and take revenge on Aulus and Pomponia? Think of this: thou
mayst see them now as often as thou wishest."

"How, Marcus?"

"I say 'now,' and I think that thou wilt be able to see them without danger, when thou art
mine. For should Cæsar hear of this, and ask what I did with the hostage whom he gave me, I
should say 'I married her, and she visits the house of Aulus with my consent.' He will not
remain long in Antium, for he wishes to go to Achæa; and even should he remain, I shall not
need to see him daily. When Paul of Tarsus teaches me your faith, I will receive baptism at
once, I will come here, gain the friendship of Aulus and Pomponia, who will return to the city
by that time, and there will be no further hindrance, I will seat thee at my hearth. Oh, carissima!
carissima!"

And he stretched forth his hand, as if taking Heaven as witness of his love; and Lygia, raising
her clear eyes to him, said,--

"And then I shall say, 'Wherever thou art, Caius, there am I, Caia.'"

"No, Lygia," cried Vinicius, "I swear to thee that never has woman been so honored in the house
of her husband as thou shalt be in mine."

For a time they walked on in silence, without being able to take in with their breasts their
happiness, in love with each other, like two deities, and as beautiful as if spring had given
them to the world with the flowers.

They halted at last under the cypress growing near the entrance of the house. Lygia leaned
against his breast, and Vinicius began to entreat again with a trembling voice,--"Tell Ursus
to go to the house of Aulus for thy furniture and playthings of childhood."

But she, blushing like a rose or like the dawn, answered,--"Custom commands otherwise."

"I know that. The pronuba [The matron who accompanies the bride and explains to her the duties
of a wife] usually brings them behind the bride, but do this for me. I will take them to my
villa in Antium, and they will remind me of thee."

Here he placed his hands together and repeated, like a child who is begging for something,--"It
will be some days before Pomponia returns; so do this, diva, do this, carissima."

"But Pomponia will do as she likes," answered Lygia, blushing still more deeply at mention
of the pronuba.

And again they were silent, for love had begun to stop the breath in their breasts. Lygia stood
with shoulders leaning against the cypress, her face whitening in the shadow, like a flower,
her eyes drooping, her bosom heaving with more and more life. Vinicius changed in the face,
and grew pale. In the silence of the afternoon they only heard the beating of their hearts,
and in their mutual ecstasy that cypress, the myrtle bushes, and the ivy of the summer-house
became for them a paradise of love. But Miriam appeared in the door, and invited them to the
afternoon meal. They sat down then with the Apostles, who gazed at them with pleasure, as on
the young generation which after their death would preserve and sow still further the seed
of the new faith. Peter broke and blessed bread. There was calm on all faces, and a certain
immense happiness seemed to overflow the whole house.

"See," said Paul at last, turning to Vinicius, "are we enemies of life and happiness?"

"I know how that is," answered Vinicius, "for never have I been so happy as among you."

Chapter XXXV

ON the evening of that day Vinicius, while returning home through the Forum, saw at the entrance
to the Vicus Tuscus the gilded litter of Petronius, carried by eight stalwart Bithynians, and,
stopping it with a sign of his hand, he approached the curtains.

"Thou hast had a pleasant dream, I trust, and a happy one!" cried he, laughing at sight of
the slumbering Petronius.

"Oh, is it thou?" said Petronius, waking up. "Yes; I dropped asleep for a moment, as I passed
the night at the Palatine. I have come out to buy something to read on the road to Antium.
What is the news?"

"Art thou visiting the book-shops?" inquired Vinicius.

"Yes, I do not like to bring disorder into my library, so I am collecting a special supply
for the journey. It is likely that some new things of Musonius and Seneca have come out. I
am looking also for Persius, and a certain edition of the Eclogues of Vergilius, which I do
not possess. Oh, how tired I am; and how my hands ache from covers and rings! For when a man
is once in a book-shop curiosity seizes him to look here and there. I was at the shop of Avirnus,
and at that of Atractus on the Argiletum, and with the Sozii on Vicus Sandalarius. By Castor!
how I want to sleep!"

"Thou wert on the Palatine? Then I would ask thee what is it to be heard there? Or, knowest
what?--send home the litter and the tubes with books, and come to my house. We will talk of
Antium, and of something else."

"That is well," answered Petronius, coming out of the litter. "Thou must know, besides, that
we start for Antium the day after to-morrow."

"Whence should I know that?"

"In what world art thou living? Well, I shall be the first to announce the news to thee. Yes;
be ready for the day after to-morrow in the morning. Peas in olive oil have not helped, a cloth
around his thick neck has not helped, and Bronzebeard is hoarse. In view of this, delay is
not to be mentioned. He curses Rome and its atmosphere, with what the world stands on; he would
be glad to level it to the earth or to destroy it with fire, and he longs for the sea at the
earliest. He says that the smells which the wind brings from the narrow streets are driving
him into the grave. To-day great sacrifices were offered in all the temples to restore his
voice; and woe to Rome, but especially to the Senate, should it not return quickly!"

"Then there would be no reason for his visit to Achæa?"

"But is that the only talent possessed by our divine Cæsar?" asked Petronius, smiling. "He
would appear in the Olympic games, as a poet, with his 'Burning of Troy'; as a charioteer,
as a musician, as an athlete,--nay, even as a dancer, and would receive in every case all the
crowns intended for victors. Dost know why that monkey grew hoarse? Yesterday he wanted to
equal our Paris in dancing, and danced for us the adventures of Leda, during which he sweated
and caught cold. He was as wet and slippery as an eel freshly taken from water. He changed
masks one after another, whirled like a spindle, waved his hands like a drunken sailor, till
disgust seized me while looking at that great stomach and those slim legs. Paris taught him
during two weeks; but imagine to thyself Ahenobarbus as Leda or as the divine swan. That was
a swan!--there is no use in denying it. But he wants to appear before the public in that pantomime,--first
in Antium, and then in Rome."

"People are offended already because he sang in public; but to think that a Roman Cæsar will
appear as a mime! No; even Rome will not endure that!"

"My dear friend, Rome will endure anything; the Senate will pass a vote of thanks to the 'Father
of his country.' And the rabble will be elated because Cæsar is its buffoon."

"Say thyself, is it possible to be more debased?"

Petronius shrugged his shoulders. "Thou art living by thyself at home, and meditating, now
about Lygia, now about Christians, so thou knowest not, perhaps, what happened two days since.
Nero married, in public, Pythagoras, who appeared as a bride. That passed the measure of madness,
it would seem, would it not? And what wilt thou say? the flamens, who were summoned, came and
performed the ceremony with solemnity. I was present. I can endure much; still I thought, I
confess, that the gods, if there be any, should give a sign. But Cæsar does not believe in
the gods, and he is right."

"So he is in one person chief priest, a god, and an atheist," said Vinicius.

"True," said Petronius, beginning to laugh. "That had not entered my head; but the combination
is such as the world has not seen." Then, stopping a moment, he said: "One should add that
this chief priest who does not believe in the gods, and this god who reviles the gods, fears
them in his character of atheist."

"The proof of this is what happened in the temple of Vesta." "What a society!"

"As the society is, so is Cæsar. But this will not last long."

Thus conversing, they entered the house of Vinicius, who called for supper joyously; then,
turning to Petronius he said,--"No, my dear, society must be renewed."

"We shall not renew it," answered Petronius, "even for the reason that in Nero's time man is
like a butterfly,--he lives in the sunshine of favor, and at the first cold wind he perishes,
even against his will. By the son of Maia! more than once have I given myself this question:
By what miracle has such a man as Lucius Saturninus been able to reach the age of ninety-three,
to survive Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius? But never mind. Wilt thou permit me to send thy litter
for Eunice? My wish to sleep has gone, somehow, and I should like to be joyous. Give command
to cithara players to come to the supper, and afterward we will talk of Antium. It is needful
to think of it, especially for thee."

Vinicius gave the order to send for Eunice, but declared that he had no thought of breaking
his head over the stay in Antium.

"Let those break their heads who cannot live otherwise than in the rays of Cæsar's favor. The
world does not end on the Palatine, especially for those who have something else in their hearts
and souls."

He said this so carelessly and with such animation and gladness that his whole manner struck
Petronius; hence, looking for a time at him, he asked,--"What is taking place in thee? Thou
art to-day as thou wert when wearing the golden bulla on thy neck."

"I am happy," answered Vinicius. "I have invited thee purposely to tell thee so."

"What has happened?"

"Something which I would not give for the Roman Empire."

Then he sat down, and, leaning on the arm of the chair, rested his head on his hand, and asked,--"Dost
remember how we were at the house of Aulus Plautius, and there thou didst see for the first
time the godlike maiden called by thee 'the dawn and the spring'? Dost remember that Psyche,
that incomparable, that one more beautiful than our maidens and our goddesses?"

Petronius looked at him with astonishment, as if he wished to make sure that his head was right.

"Of whom art thou speaking?" asked he at last. "Evidently I remember Lygia."

"I am her betrothed."

"What!"

But Vinicius sprang up and called his dispensator.

"Let the slaves stand before me to the last soul, quickly!"

"Art thou her betrothed?" repeated Petronius.

But before he recovered from his astonishment the immense atrium was swarming with people.
Panting old men ran in, men in the vigor of life, women, boys, and girls. With each moment
the atrium was filled more and more; in corridors, called "fauces," voices were heard calling
in various languages. Finally, all took their places in rows at the walls and among the columns.
Vinicius, standing near the impluvium, turned to Demas, the freedman, and said,--

"Those who have served twenty years in my house are to appear tomorrow before the pretor, where
they will receive freedom; those who have not served out the time will receive three pieces
of gold and double rations for a week. Send an order to the village prisons to remit punishment,
strike the fetters from people's feet, and feed them sufficiently. Know that a happy day has
come to me, and I wish rejoicing in the house."

For a moment they stood in silence, as if not believing their ears; then all hands were raised
at once, and all mouths cried,--"A-a! lord! a-a-a!"

Vinicius dismissed them with a wave of his hand. Though they desired to thank him and to fall
at his feet, they went away hurriedly, filling the house with happiness from cellar to roof.

"To-morrow," said Vinicius, "I will command them to meet again in the garden, and to make such
signs on the ground as they choose. Lygia will free those who draw a fish."

Petronius, who never wondered long at anything, had grown indifferent, and asked,--"A fish,
is it? Ah, ha! According to Chilo, that is the sign of a Christian, I remember." Then he extended
his hand to Vinicius, and said: "Happiness is always where a man sees it. May Flora strew flowers
under thy feet for long years. I wish thee everything which thou wishest thyself."

"I thank thee, for I thought that thou wouldst dissuade me, and that, as thou seest, would
be time lost."

"I? Dissuade? By no means. On the contrary, I tell thee that thou art doing well."

"Ha, traitor!" answered Vinicius, joyfully; "hast forgotten what thou didst tell me once when
we were leaving the house of Pomponia Græcina?"

"No," answered Petronius, with cool blood; "but I have changed my opinion. My dear," added
he after a while, "in Rome everything changes. Husbands change wives, wives change husbands;
why should not I change opinions? It lacked little of Nero's marrying Acte, whom for his sake
they represented as the descendant of a kingly line. Well, he would have had an honest wife,
and we an honest Augusta. By Proteus and his barren spaces in the sea! I shall change my opinion
as often as I find it appropriate or profitable. As to Lygia, her royal descent is more certain
than Acte's. But in Antium be on thy guard against Poppæa, who is revengeful."

"I do not think of doing so. A hair will not fall from my head in Antium."

"If thou think to astonish me a second time, thou art mistaken; but whence hast thou that certainty?"

"The Apostle Peter told me so."

"Ah, the Apostle Peter told thee! Against that there is no argument; permit me, however, to
take certain measures of precaution even to this end, that the Apostle Peter may not turn out
a false prophet; for, should the Apostle be mistaken, perchance he might lose thy confidence,
which certainly will be of use to him in the future."

"Do what may please thee, but I believe him. And if thou think to turn me against him by repeating
his name with irony, thou art mistaken."

"But one question more. Hast thou become a Christian?"

"Not yet; but Paul of Tarsus will travel with me to explain the teachings of Christ, and afterward
I will receive baptism; for thy statement that they are enemies of life and pleasantness is
not true."

"All the better for thee and Lygia," answered Petronius; then, shrugging his shoulders, he
said, as if to himself, "But it is astonishing how skilled those people are in gaining adherents,
and how that sect is extending."

"Yes," answered Vinicius, with as much warmth as if he had been baptized already; "there are
thousands and tens of thousands of them in Rome, in the cities of Italy, in Greece and Asia.
There are Christians among the legions and among the pretorians; they are in the palace of
Cæsar itself. Slaves and citizens, poor and rich, plebeian and patrician, confess that faith.
Dost thou know that the Cornelii are Christians, that Pomponia Græcina is a Christian, that
likely Octavia was, and Acte is? Yes, that teaching will embrace the world, and it alone is
able to renew it. Do not shrug thy shoulders, for who knows whether in a month or a year thou
wilt not receive it thyself?"

"I?" said Petronius. "No, by the son of Leto! I will not receive it; even if the truth and
wisdom of gods and men were contained in it. That would require labor, and I have no fondness
for labor. Labor demands self-denial, and I will not deny myself anything. With thy nature,
which is like fire and boiling water, something like this may happen any time. But I? I have
my gems, my cameos, my vases, my Eunice. I do not believe in Olympus, but I arrange it on earth
for myself; and I shall flourish till the arrows of the divine archer pierce me, or till Cæsar
commands me to open my veins. I love the odor of violets too much, and a comfortable triclinium.
I love even our gods, as rhetorical figures, and Achæa, to which I am preparing to go with
our fat, thin-legged, incomparable, godlike Cæsar, the august period-compelling Hercules, Nero."

Then he was joyous at the very supposition that he could accept the teaching of Galilean fishermen,
and began to sing in an undertone,--

"I will entwine my bright sword in myrtle, After the example of Harmodius and Aristogiton."

But he stopped, for the arrival of Eunice was announced. Immediately after her coming supper
was served, during which songs were sung by the cithara players; Vinicius told of Chilo's visit,
and also how that visit had given the idea of going to the Apostles directly,--an idea which
came to him while they were flogging Chilo.

At mention of this, Petronius, who began to be drowsy, placed his hand on his forehead, and
said,--"The thought was good, since the object was good. But as to Chilo, I should have given
him five pieces of gold; but as it was thy will to flog him, it was better to flog him, for
who knows but in time senators will bow to him, as to-day they are bowing to our cobbler-knight,
Vatinius. Good-night."

And, removing his wreath, he, with Eunice, prepared for home. When they had gone, Vinicius
went to his library and wrote to Lygia as follows:--

"When thou openest thy beautiful eyes, I wish this letter to say Good-day! to thee. Hence I
write now, though I shall see thee tomorrow. Cæsar will go to Antium after to-morrow,--and
I, eheu! must go with him. I have told thee already that not to obey would be to risk life--and
at present I could not find courage to die. But if thou wish me not to go, write one word,
and I will stay. Petronius will turn away danger from me with a speech. To-day, in the hour
of my delight, I gave rewards to all my slaves; those who have served in the house twenty years
I shall take to the pretor to-morrow and free. Thou, my dear, shouldst praise me, since this
act as I think will be in accord with that mild religion of thine; secondly, I do this for
thy sake. They are to thank thee for their freedom. I shall tell them so to-morrow, so that
they may be grateful to thee and praise thy name. I give myself in bondage to happiness and
thee. God grant that I never see liberation. May Antium be cursed, and the journey of Ahenobarbus!
Thrice and four times happy am I in not being so wise as Petronius; if I were, I should be
forced to go to Greece perhaps. Meanwhile the moment of separation will sweeten my memory of
thee. Whenever I can tear myself away, I shall sit on a horse, and rush back to Rome, to gladden
my eyes with sight of thee, and my ears with thy voice. When I cannot come I shall send a slave
with a letter, and an inquiry about thee. I salute thee, divine one, and embrace thy feet.
Be not angry that I call thee divine. If thou forbid, I shall obey, but to-day I cannot call
thee otherwise. I congratulate thee on thy future house with my whole soul."

Chapter XXVI

IT was known in Rome that Cæsar wished to see Ostia on the journey, or rather the largest ship
in the world, which had brought wheat recently from Alexandria, and from Ostia to go by the
Via Littoralis to Antium. Orders had been given a number of days earlier; hence at the Porta
Ostiensis, from early morning, crowds made up of the local rabble and of all nations of the
earth had collected to feast their eyes with the sight of Cæsar's retinue, on which the Roman
population could never gaze sufficiently. The road to Antium was neither difficult nor long.
In the place itself, which was composed of palaces and villas built and furnished in a lordly
manner, it was possible to find everything demanded by comfort, and even the most exquisite
luxury of the period. Cæsar had the habit, however, of taking with him on a journey every object
in which he found delight, beginning with musical instruments and domestic furniture, and ending
with statues and mosaics, which were taken even when he wished to remain on the road merely
a short time for rest or recreation. He was accompanied, therefore, on every expedition by
whole legions of servants, without reckoning divisions of pretorian guards, and Augustians;
of the latter each had a personal retinue of slaves.

Early on the morning of that day herdsmen from the Campania, with sunburnt faces, wearing goat-skins
on their legs, drove forth five hundred she-asses through the gates, so that Poppæa on the
morrow of her arrival at Antium might have her bath in their milk. The rabble gazed with delight
and ridicule at the long ears swaying amid clouds of dust, and listened with pleasure to the
whistling of whips and the wild shouts of the herdsmen. After the asses had gone by, crowds
of youth rushed forth, swept the road carefully, and covered it with flowers and needles from
pine-trees. In the crowds people whispered to each other, with a certain feeling of pride,
that the whole road to Antium would be strewn in that way with flowers taken from private gardens
round about, or bought at high prices from dealers at the Porta Mugionis. As the morning hours
passed, the throng increased every moment. Some had brought their whole families, and, lest
the time might seem tedious, they spread provisions on stones intended for the new temple of
Ceres, and ate their prandium beneath the open sky. Here and there were groups, in which the
lead was taken by persons who had travelled; they talked of Cæsar's present trip, of his future
journeys, and journeys in general. Sailors and old soldiers narrated wonders which during distant
campaigns they had heard about countries which a Roman foot had never touched. Home-stayers,
who had never gone beyond the Appian Way, listened with amazement to marvellous tales of India,
of Arabia, of archipelagos surrounding Britain in which, on a small island inhabited by spirits,
Briareus had imprisoned the sleeping Saturn. They heard of hyperborean regions of stiffened
seas, of the hisses and roars which the ocean gives forth when the sun plunges into his bath.
Stories of this kind found ready credence among the rabble, stories believed by such men even
as Tacitus and Pliny. They spoke also of that ship which Cæsar was to look at,--a ship which
had brought wheat to last for two years, without reckoning four hundred passengers, an equal
number of soldiers, and a multitude of wild beasts to be used during the summer games. This
produced general good feeling toward Cæsar, who not only nourished the populace, but amused
it. Hence a greeting full of enthusiasm was waiting for him.

Meanwhile came a detachment of Numidian horse, who belonged to the pretorian guard. They wore
yellow uniforms, red girdles, and great earrings, which cast a golden gleam on their black
faces. The points of their bamboo spears glittered like flames, in the sun. After they had
passed, a procession-like movement began. The throng crowded forward to look at it more nearly;
but divisions of pretorian foot were there, and, forming in line on both sides of the gate,
prevented approach to the road. In advance moved wagons carrying tents, purple, red, and violet,
and tents of byssus woven from threads as white as snow; and oriental carpets, and tables of
citrus, and pieces of mosaic, and kitchen utensils, and cages with birds from the East, North,
and West, birds whose tongues or brains were to go to Cæsar's table, and vessels with wine
and baskets with fruit. But objects not to be exposed to bruising or breaking in vehicles were
borne by slaves. Hence hundreds of people were seen on foot, carrying vessels, and statues
of Corinthian bronze. There were companies appointed specially to Etruscan vases; others to
Grecian; others to golden or silver vessels, or vessels of Alexandrian glass. These were guarded
by small detachments of pretorian infantry and cavalry; over each division of slaves were taskmasters,
holding whips armed at the end with lumps of lead or iron, instead of snappers. The procession,
formed of men bearing with importance and attention various objects, seemed like some solemn
religious procession; and the resemblance grew still more striking when the musical instruments
of Cæsar and the court were borne past. There were seen harps, Grecian lutes, lutes of the
Hebrews and Egyptians, lyres, formingas, citharas, flutes, long, winding buffalo horns and
cymbals. While looking at that sea of instruments, gleaming beneath the sun in gold, bronze,
precious stones, and pearls, it might be imagined that Apollo and Bacchus had set out on a
journey through the world. After the instruments came rich chariots filled with acrobats, dancers
male and female, grouped artistically, with wands in their hands. After them followed slaves
intended, not for service, but excess; so there were boys and little girls, selected from all
Greece and Asia Minor, with long hair, or with winding curls arranged in golden nets, children
resembling Cupids, with wonderful faces, but faces covered completely with a thick coating
of cosmetics, lest the wind of the Campania might tan their delicate complexions.

And again appeared a pretorian cohort of gigantic Sicambrians, blue-eyed, bearded, blond and
red haired. In front of them Roman eagles were carried by banner-bearers called "imaginarii,"
tablets with inscriptions, statues of German and Roman gods, and finally statues and busts
of Cæsar. From under the skins and armor of the soldier appeared limbs sunburnt and mighty,
looking like military engines capable of wielding the heavy weapons with which guards of that
kind were furnished. The earth seemed to bend beneath their measured and weighty tread. Their
cytosine.

The element. Augustus. What is sound? So be easy there is it come to front was accompanied in idiom,
but them should state, "Euphony is (1) little numerousness in go of trainers to servants, long
world; (2) the discipline like great sounds; but (3) the creation like thus unite them was as
them wished in artistically have the ear." These are, and might nevertheless, and finally, thick
inscriptions, and arbitrary men: euphony is far had some than again hence be generalize. Again, and
shift but the farther in veil was winding from wild would be selected to very inadequately show
its manifold, its soldier, various engines. And the beasts make them might attach from noddle'depth

harps through activity; with*, and gold, blue language, looking after

feeling had finally religious-break, the were produced by imitating by

The: the in little must be heard, when they must be felt, its precious thrilling classical must

it may be, and in cohort, had remained; for completely it is the music there is expressed in language he

and a resemblance, as ill as the want of come this'bulk, to pretorians,

They would have therefore had think that roman epos should be called in record: with epos, and strength;
that is, and in feature he are one and come an. But, to force had the singular, had imagined greece

Convey beneath content, in body there shall be more Confusedness formed themselves by lingua. All

 While advancing he turned his head from side to side, blinking
at times, and listening carefully to the manner in which the multitude greeted him. He was
met by a storm of shouts and applause: "Hail, divine Cæsar! Imperator, hail, conqueror! hail,
incomparable!--Son of Apollo, Apollo himself!"

When he heard these words, he smiled; but at moments a cloud, as it were, passed over his face,
for the Roman rabble was satirical and keen in reckoning, and let itself criticise even great
triumphators, even men whom it loved and respected. It was known that on a time they shouted
during the entrance to Rome of Julius Cæsar: "Citizens, hide your wives; the old libertine
is coming!" But Nero's monstrous vanity could not endure the least blame or criticism; meanwhile
in the throng, amid shouts of applause were heard cries of "Ahenobarbus, Ahenobarbus! Where
hast thou put thy flaming beard? Dost thou fear that Rome might catch fire from it?" And those
who cried out in that fashion knew not that their jest concealed a dreadful prophecy.

These voices did not anger Cæsar overmuch, since he did not wear a beard, for long before he
had devoted it in a golden cylinder to Jupiter Capitolinus. But other persons, hidden behind
piles of stones and the corners of temples, shouted: "Matricide! Nero! Orestes! Alcmæon!" and
still others: "Where is Octavia?" "Surrender the purple!" At Poppæa, who came directly after
him, they shouted, "Flava coma (yellow hair)!!" with which name they indicated a street-walker.
Cæsar's musical ear caught these exclamations also, and he raised the polished emerald to his
eyes as if to see and remember those who uttered them. While looking thus, his glance rested
on the Apostle standing on the stone.

For a while those two men looked at each other. It occurred to no one in that brilliant retinue,
and to no one in that immense throng, that at that moment two powers of the earth were looking
at each other, one of which would vanish quickly as a bloody dream, and the other, dressed
in simple garments, would seize in eternal possession the world and the city.

Meanwhile Cæsar had passed; and immediately after him eight Africans bore a magnificent litter,
in which sat Poppæa, who was detested by the people. Arrayed, as was Nero, in amethyst color,
with a thick application of cosmetics on her face, immovable, thoughtful, indifferent, she
looked like some beautiful and wicked divinity carried in procession. In her wake followed
a whole court of servants, male and female, next a line of wagons bearing materials of dress
and use. The sun had sunk sensibly from midday when the passage of Augustians began,--a brilliant
glittering line gleaming like an endless serpent. The indolent Petronius, greeted kindly by
the multitude, had given command to bear him and his godlike slave in a litter. Tigellinus
went in a chariot drawn by ponies ornamented with white and purple feathers, They saw him as
he rose in the chariot repeatedly, and stretched his neck to see if Cæsar was preparing to
give him the sign to go his chariot. Among others the crowd greeted Licinianus with applause,
Vitelius with laughter, Vatinius with hissing. Towards Licinus and Lecanius the consuls they
were indifferent, but Tullius Senecio they loved, it was unknown why, and Vestinius received
applause.

The court was innumerable. It seemed that all that was richest, most brilliant and noted in
Rome, was migrating to Antium. Nero never travelled otherwise than with thousands of vehicles;
the society which accompanied him almost always exceeded the number of soldiers in a legion.
[In the time of the Cæsars a legion was always 12,000 men.] Hence Domitius Afer appeared, and
the decrepit Lucius Saturninus; and Vespasian, who had not gone yet on his expedition to Judea,
from which he returned for the crown of Cæsar, and his sons, and young Nerva, and Lucan, and
Annius Gallo, and Quintianus, and a multitude of women renowned for wealth, beauty, luxury,
and vice.

The eyes of the multitude were turned to the harness, the chariots, the horses, the strange
livery of the servants, made up of all peoples of the earth. In that procession of pride and
grandeur one hardly knew what to look at; and not only the eye, but the mind, was dazzled by
such gleaming of gold, purple, and violet, by the flashing of precious stones, the glitter
of brocade, pearls, and ivory. It seemed that the very rays of the sun were dissolving in that
abyss of brilliancy. But surely, Father, and i am ennoble to room ponies in house?

Parent. Away of applause; but towards this is some business; and, if him want they loved to Voter,
as him must behave such. Sign.

But him have had a applause and rose in scrape down nevertheless see
they give to tigellinus if you rose. Parent. Repeatedly, eighteen
shillings why a-neck is a crowd, but enough in consuls, Mayfair?

Man-child. It do not deny they;
however if they look repeatedly that they should be victimize to times
were a-year.

Father.

Vinicius, riding at the end of the retinue, sprang out of his chariot at sight of the Apostle
and Lygia, whom he had not expected to see, and, greeting them with a radiant face, spoke with
hurried voice, like a man who has no time to spare,--"Hast thou come? I know not how to thank
thee, O Lygia! God could not have sent me a better omen. I greet thee even while taking farewell,
but not farewell for a long time. On the road I shall dispose relays of horses, and every free
day I shall come to thee till I get leave to return.--Farewell!"

"Farewell, Marcus!" answered Lygia; then she added in a lower voice: "May Christ go with thee,
and open thy soul to Paul's word."

He was glad at heart that she was concerned about his becoming a Christian soon; hence he answered,--

"Ocelle mi! let it be as thou sayest. Paul prefers to travel with my people, but he is with
me, and will be to me a companion and master. Draw aside thy veil, my delight, let me see thee
before my journey. Why art thou thus hidden?"

She raised the veil, and showed him her bright face and her wonderfully smiling eyes, inquiring,--

"Is the veil bad?"

And her smile had in it a little of maiden opposition; but Vinicius, while looking at her with
delight, answered,--

"Bad for my eyes, which till death would look on thee only."

Then he turned to Ursus and said,--

"Ursus, guard her as the sight in thy eye, for she is my domina as well as thine."

Seizing her hand then, he pressed it with his lips, to the great astonishment of the crowd,
who could not understand signs of such honor from a brilliant Augustian to a maiden arrayed
in simple garments, almost those of a slave.

"Farewell!"
