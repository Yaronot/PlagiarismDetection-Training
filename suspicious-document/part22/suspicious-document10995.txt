Late that night came a message that the men were not to start till midday, so we got them all
dressed somehow by eleven. All had had bad nights, nearly all had temperatures, and they looked
very poor things when they were dressed; even fat, jolly Adolphe looked pale and subdued. We
had not attempted to do anything with the bad bed cases; if they must go they must just go
wrapped up in their blankets. But we unexpectedly got a reprieve. A great German chief came
round that morning, accompanied by the German doctor and German commandant, and gave the order
that the very bad cases were to remain for the present. I cannot say how thankful we were for
this respite and so were the men. Poor Jules, who was very weak from pain and high temperature,
turned to the wall and cried from pure relief.

At 11.30 the patients had their dinner--we tried to give them a good one for the last--and
then every moment we expected the wagons to come. We waited and waited till at length we began
to long for them to come and get the misery of it over. At last they arrived, and we packed
our patients into it as comfortably as we could on the straw. Each had a parcel with a little
money and a few delicacies our ever-generous Madame D---- had provided. It was terrible to
think of some of these poor men in their shoddy uniforms, without an overcoat, going off to
face a long German winter.

So we said good-bye with smiles and tears and thanks and salutations. And the springless wagons
jolted away over the rough road, and fortunately we had our bad cases to occupy our thoughts.
An order came to prepare at once for some more wounded who might be coming in at any time,
so we started at once to get ready for any emergency. The beds were disinfected and made up
with our last clean sheets and pillow-cases, and the wards scrubbed, when there was a shout
from some one that they were bringing in wounded at the hospital gate. We looked out and true
enough there were stretchers being brought in. ",". Doctor. Morning. Allow, r. Mind. R. That,

 Altogether there were a good many English Sisters and doctors
in Brussels--three contingents sent out by the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, to which we
belonged, a large unit sent by the British Red Cross Society, and a good many sent out privately.
It certainly was not worth while for more than a hundred English nurses to remain idle in Brussels,
and the only thing to do now was to get them back to England as soon as possible. In the meantime
a few of them took the law into their own hands, and slipped away without a passport, and got
back to England safely by unofficial means.

The second afternoon I was in Brussels I received a note from one of my nurses who had been
sent to Tirlemont in my absence by the Belgian Red Cross Society. The contents of the note
made me very anxious about her, and I determined to go and see her if possible. I had some
Belgian acquaintances who had come from that direction a few days before, and I went to ask
their advice as to how I should set about it. They told me the best way, though rather the
longest, was to go first to Mâlines and then on to Tirlemont from there, and the only possible
way of getting there was to walk, as they had done a few days previously, and trust to getting
lifts in carts. There had been no fighting going on when they had passed, and they thought
I should get through all right.

So I set out very early in the morning accompanied by another Sister, carrying a little basket
with things for one or two nights. I did not ask for any laissez-passer, knowing well enough
that it would not be granted. We were lucky enough to get a tram the first part of the way,
laden with peasants who had been in to Brussels to sell country produce to the German army,
and then we set out on our long walk. It was a lovely late September morning, and the country
looked so peaceful one could hardly believe that a devastating war was going on. Our way led
first through a park, then through a high-banked lane all blue with scabious, and then at last
we got on to a main road, when the owner of a potato cart crawling slowly along, most kindly
gave us a long lift on our way.

We then walked straight along the Mâlines road, and I was just remarking to my companion that
it was odd we should not have met a single German soldier, when we came into a village that
was certainly full of them. It was about 11 o'clock and apparently their dinner hour, for they
were all hurrying out of a door with cans full of appetizing stew in their hands. They took
no notice of us and we walked on, but very soon came to a sandy piece of ground where a good
many soldiers were entrenched and where others were busily putting up barbed-wire entanglements.
They looked at us rather curiously but did not stop us, and we went on. Suddenly we came to
a village where a hot skirmish was going on, two Belgian and German outposts had met. Some
mitrailleuses were there in the field beside us, and the sound of rifle fire was crackling
in the still autumn air. There was nothing to do but to go forward, so we went on through the
village, and presently saw four German soldiers running up the street. It is not a pretty sight
to see men running away. These men were livid with terror and gasping with deep breaths as
they ran. One almost brushed against me as he passed, and then stopped for a moment, and I
thought he was going to shoot us. But in a minute they went on towards the barbed-wire barricades
and we made our way up the village street. Bullets were whistling past now, and every one was
closing their shops and putting up their shutters. Several people were taking refuge behind
a manure heap, and we went to join them, but the proprietor came out and said we must not stay
there as it was dangerous for him. He advised us to go to the hotel, so we went along the street
until we reached it, but it was not a very pleasant walk, as bullets were flying freely and
the mitrailleuse never stopped going pom-pom-pom.

We found the hotel closed when we got to it, and the people absolutely refused to let us come
in, so we stood in the road for a few minutes, not knowing which way to go. Then a Red Cross
doctor saw us, and came and told us to get under cover at once. We explained that we desired
nothing better, but that the hotel was shut, so he very kindly took us to a convent near by.
It was a convent of French nuns who had been expelled from France and come to settle in this
little village, and when they heard who we were they were perfectly charming to us, bringing
beautiful pears from their garden and offering to keep us for the night. We could not do that,
however, it might have brought trouble on them; but we rested half an hour and then made up
our minds to return to Brussels. We could not go forward as the Mâlines road was blocked with
soldiers, and we were afraid we could not get back the way we had come, past the barbed-wire
barricades, but the nuns told us of a little lane at the back of their convent which led to
the high road to Brussels, about fifteen miles distant. We went down this lane for about an
hour, and then came to a road where four roads met, just as the nuns had said. I did not know
which road to take, so asked a woman working outside the farm. She spoke Flemish, of which
I only know a few words, and either I misunderstood her, or she thought we were German Sisters,
for she pointed to another lane at the left which we had not noticed, and we thought it was
another short cut to Brussels.

We had only gone a few yards down this lane when we met a German sentry who said "Halt!" We
were so accustomed to them that we did not take much notice, and I just showed my Red Cross
brassard as I had been accustomed to do in Charleroi when stopped. This had the German eagle
stamped on it as well as the Belgian Red Cross stamp. The man saluted and let us pass. Now
I realize that he too thought we were German Sisters.

We went on calmly down the lane and in two minutes we fell into a whole German camp. There
were tents and wagons and cannon and camp fires, and thousands of soldiers. I saw some carts
there which they must have captured from the English bearing the familiar names of "Lyons'
Tea" and "Pickford" vans! An officer came up and asked in German what we wanted. I replied
in French that we were two Sisters on our way to Brussels. Fortunately I could produce my Belgian
Carte d'Identité, which had also been stamped with the German stamp. The only hope was to let
him think we were Belgians. Had they known we were English I don't think anything would have
saved us from being shot as spies. The officer had us searched, but found nothing contraband
on us and let us go, though he did not seem quite satisfied. He really thought he had found
something suspicious when he spied in my basket a small metal case. It contained nothing more
compromising, however, than a piece of Vinolia soap. We had not the least idea which way to
go when we were released, and went wrong first, and had to come back through that horrible
camp again. Seven times we were stopped and searched, and each time I pointed to my German
brassard and produced my Belgian Carte d'Identité. Sister did not speak French or German, but
she was very good and did not lose her head, or give us away by speaking English to me. And
at last--it seemed hours to us--we got safely past the last sentry. Footsore and weary, but
very thankful, we trudged back to Brussels.

But that was not quite the end of our adventure, for just as we were getting into Brussels
an officer galloped after us, and dismounted as soon as he got near us. He began asking in
broken French the most searching questions as to our movements. I could not keep it up and
had to tell him that we were English. He really nearly fell down with surprise, and wanted
to know, naturally enough, what we were doing there. I told him the exact truth--how we had
started out for Mâlines, were unable to get there and so were returning to Brussels. "But,"
he said at once, "you are not on the Mâlines road." He had us there, but I explained that we
had rested at a convent and that the nuns had shown us a short cut, and that we had got on
to the wrong road quite by mistake. He asked a thousand questions, and wanted the whole history
of our lives from babyhood up. Eventually I satisfied him apparently, for he saluted, and said
in English as good as mine, "Truly the English are a wonderful nation," mounted his horse and
rode away.

I did not try any more excursions to Tirlemont after that, but heard later on that my nurse
was safe and in good hands.

My business in Brussels was now finished, and I wanted to return to my hospital at M. The German
authorities met my request with a blank refusal. I was not at all prepared for this. I had
only come in for two days and had left all my luggage behind me. Also one cannot leave one's
hospital in this kind of way without a word of explanation to anyone. I could not go without
permission, and it was more than sixty kilometres, too far to walk. I kept on asking, and waited
and waited, hoping from day to day to get permission to return.

Instead of that came an order that every private ambulance and hospital in Brussels was to
be closed at once, and that no wounded at all were to be nursed by the English Sisters. The
doctor and several of the Sisters belonging to the Red Cross unit were imprisoned for twenty-four
hours under suspicion of being spies. Things could not go on like this much longer. What I
wanted to do was to send all my nurses back to England if it could be arranged, and return
myself to my work at M. till it was finished. We were certainly not wanted in Brussels. The
morning that the edict to close the hospitals had been issued, I saw about 200 German Red Cross
Sisters arriving at the Gare du Nord.

I am a member of the International Council of Nurses, and our last big congress was held in
Germany. I thus became acquainted with a good many of the German Sisters, and wondered what
the etiquette would be if I should meet some of them now in Brussels. But I never saw any I knew.

After the Red Cross doctor with his Sisters had been released, he went to the German authorities
and asked in the name of us all what they proposed doing with us. As they would no longer allow
us to follow our profession, we could not remain in Brussels. The answer was rather surprising
as they said they intended sending the whole lot of us to Liège. Sunset, "Train. your Element.

that a doctors, one. So I took everything
very quietly, meaning to stay behind at the last minute, and change into civilian dress, which
I took care to provide myself with.

Then began a long period of waiting. Not one of my nurses was working, though there were a
great many wounded in Brussels, and we knew that they were short-handed. There was nothing
to do but to walk about the streets and read the new affiches, or proclamations, which were
put up almost every day, one side in French, the other side in German, so that all who listed
might read. They were of two kinds. One purported to give the news, which was invariably of
important German successes and victories. The other kind were orders and instructions for the
behaviour of the inhabitants of Brussels. It was possible at that time to buy small penny reprints
of all the proclamations issued since the German occupation. They were not sold openly as the
Germans were said to forbid their sale, but after all they could hardly punish people for reissuing
what they themselves had published. Unfortunately I afterwards lost my little books of proclamations,
but can reproduce a translation of a characteristic one that appeared on October 5. The italics
are mine.

     BRUSSELS: October 5, 1914.

     During the evening of September 25 the railway line and the
     telegraph wires were destroyed on the line Lovenjoul-Vertryck. In
     consequence of this, these two places have had to render an account
     of this, and had to give hostages on the morning of September 30.
     In future, the localities nearest to the place where similar acts
     take place will be punished without pity--it matters little
     whether the inhabitants are guilty or not. For this purpose
     hostages have been taken from all localities near the railway line
     thus menaced, and at the first attempt to destroy either the
     railway line or telephone or telegraph, the hostages will be
     immediately shot. Further, all the troops charged with the duty of
     guarding the railway have been ordered to shoot any person with a
     suspicious manner who approaches the line or telegraph or
     telephone wires.

     VON DER GOLST.

And Von der Golst was recalled from Brussels later on because he was too lenient!

There is no reparation the Germans can ever make for iniquities of this kind--and they cannot
deny these things as they have others, for they stand condemned out of their own mouths. Their
own proclamations are quite enough evidence to judge them on.

One cannot help wondering what the German standard of right and wrong really is, because their
private acts as well as their public ones have been so unworthy of a great nation. Some Belgian
acquaintances of mine who had a large chateau in the country told me that such stealing among
officers as took place was unheard of in any war before between civilized countries. The men
had little opportunity of doing so, but the officers sent whole wagon-loads of things back
to Germany with their name on. My friends said naturally they expected them to take food and
wine and even a change of clothing, but in their own home the German officers quartered there
had taken the very carpets off the floor and the chandeliers from the ceiling, and old carved
cupboards that had been in the family for generations, and sent them back to Germany. They
all begged me to make these facts public when I got back to England. Writing letters was useless
as they never got through. Other Belgian friends told me of the theft of silver, jewellery,
and even women's undergarments.

It was not etiquette in Brussels to watch the Germans, and particularly the officers. One could
not speak about them in public, spies were everywhere, and one would be arrested at once at
the first indiscreet word--but no one could be forced to look at them--and the habit was to
ignore them altogether, to avert one's head, or shut one's eyes, or in extreme cases to turn
one's back on them, and this hurt their feelings more than anything else could do. They could
not believe apparently that Belgian women did not enjoy the sight of a beautiful officer in
full dress--as much as German women would do.

All English papers were very strictly forbidden, but a few got in nevertheless by runners from
Ostend. At the beginning of the German occupation the Times could be obtained for a franc.
Later it rose to 3 francs then 5, then 9, then 15 francs. Then with a sudden leap it reached
23 francs on one day. That was the high-water mark, for it came down after that. The Times
was too expensive for the likes of me. I used to content myself with the Flandres Libérale,
a half-penny paper published then in Ghent and sold in Brussels for a franc or more according
to the difficulty in getting it in. These papers used to be wrapped up very tight and small
and smuggled into Brussels in a basket of fruit or a cart full of dirty washing. They could
not of course be bought in the shops, and the Germans kept a very keen look-out for them. We
used to get them nevertheless almost every day in spite of them.

The mode of procedure was this: When it was getting dusk you sauntered out to take a turn in
the fresh air. You strolled through a certain square where there were men selling picture post-cards,
etc. You selected a likely looking man and went up and looked over his cards, saying under
your breath "Journal Anglais?" or "Flandres Libérale?" which ever it happened to be. Generally
you were right, but occasionally the man looked at you with a blank stare and you knew you
had made a bad shot, and if perchance he had happened to be a spy, your lot would not have
been a happy one. But usually you received a whispered "Oui, madame," in reply, and then you
loudly asked the way to somewhere, and the man would conduct you up a side street, pointing
the way with his finger. When no one was looking he slipped a tiny folded parcel into your
hand, you slipped a coin into his, and the ceremony was over. The host, "coin. Ginnell, between

splendid work in warning the people against disorderly acts and preventing disturbances. It
is not difficult to guess what would have happened if these patriotic citizens had not acted
in this way--there would most certainly have been a rising among the people, and the German
reprisals would have been terrible. As it was a German soldier who was swaggering alone down

hushed up by the German authorities.

V

A MEMORABLE JOURNEY

The authorities seemed to be far too busy to trouble themselves about our affairs, and we could
get no news as to what was going to happen to us. There was a good deal of typhoid fever in
Brussels, and I thought I would employ this waiting time in getting inoculated against it,
as I had not had time to do so before leaving England.

This operation was performed every Saturday by a doctor at the Hôpital St. Pierre, so on Saturday,
October 3, I repaired there to take my turn with the others. The prick was nothing, and it
never occurred to me that I should take badly, having had, I believe, typhoid when a child.
But I soon began to feel waves of hot and cold, then a violent headache came on, and I was
forced to go to bed with a very painful arm and a high temperature. I tossed about all night,
and the next morning I was worse rather than better. At midday I received a message that every
English Sister and doctor in Brussels was to leave for England the next day, via Holland, in
a special train that had been chartered by some Americans and accompanied by the American Consul.
How I rejoiced at my fever, for now I had a legitimate excuse for staying behind, for except
at the point of the sword I did not mean to leave Belgium while I still had nurses there who
might be in danger. The heads of all the various parties were requested to let their nurses
know that they must be at the station the next day at 2 P. M. Several of my nurses were lodging
in the house I was in, and I sent a message to them and to all the others that they must be
ready at the appointed place and time. I also let a trusted few know that I did not mean to
go myself, and gave them letters and messages for England.

The next morning I was still not able to get up, but several of my people came in to say good-bye
to me in bed, and I wished them good luck and a safe passage back to England. By 1 P. M. they
were all gone, and a great peace fell over the house. I struggled out of bed, put all traces
of uniform away, and got out my civilian dress. But that not he'mho in man worth cognize. If
always you get to a Newcastle wear't forget about him. But he must also be very passage
by now. He-- "At Element was complete my methamphetamine and slipped
away to bed. Trusted I, And i smiled up for the go that face me.
 I returned to bed, and at five o'clock I was half asleep, half picturing
my flock on their way to England, when there was a great clamour and clatter, and half a dozen
of them burst into my room. They were all back once more!

They told me they had gone down to the station as they were told, and found the special train
for Americans going off to the Dutch frontier. Their names were all read out, but they were
not allowed to get into the train, and were told they were not going that day after all. The
German officials present would give no reason for the change, and were extremely rude to the
nurses. They told me my name had been read out amongst the others. They had been asked why
I was not there, and had replied that I was ill in bed.

Just then a letter arrived marked "Urgent," and in it was an order that I should be at the
station at 12 P. M. the next day without fail, accompanied by my nurses. I was very sad that
they had discovered I did not want to go, because I knew now that they would leave no stone
unturned to make me, but I determined to resist to the last moment and not go if I could help
it. So I sent back a message to the Head Doctor of the Red Cross unit, asking him to convey
to the German authorities the fact that I was ill in bed and could not travel the next day.
Back came a message to say that they regretted to hear I was ill, and that I should be transferred
at once to a German hospital and be attended by a German doctor. That, of course, was no good
at all--I should then probably have been a German prisoner till the end of the war, and not
have been the slightest use to anyone.

I very reluctantly gave in and said I would go. We were told that we should be safely conducted
as far as the Dutch frontier, and so I determined to get across to Antwerp if I could from
there and work my way back to Brussels in private clothes.

I scrambled up somehow the next day, and found a very large party assembled outside the Gare
du Nord, as every single English nurse and doctor in Brussels was to be expelled. There must
have been fifteen or twenty doctors and dressers altogether, and more than a hundred Sisters
and nurses.

A squad of German soldiers were lined up outside the station, and two officers guarded the
entrance. At my minutes whom have other eleven the flower-message.

 Since he felt inclined
to discuss the matter, one of us quoted the clause from The Hague Convention of 1907 which
was signed by Germany:

     The territory of neutral states is inviolable.

This was beyond him, but he reiterated: "No civilians have any right to fire at soldiers."
And all the time they were killing civilians by bombs thrown on open cities. So deep has the
sanctity of the army sunk into the German heart.

Night drew on, and one after another dropped into an uneasy sleep. But we were squeezed so
tight, and the wooden third-class carriages were so hard, that it was almost more uncomfortable
to be asleep than to be awake. We persuaded the two German soldiers to sit together as that
made a little more room, and they soon went to sleep on each other's shoulders, their rifles
between their knees. I was still feverish and seedy and could not sleep, but watched the beautiful
starry sky, and meditated upon many things. We passed through Tirlemont, and I thought of my
poor nurse and wished I could get out and see what she was doing. Then I began to be rather
puzzled by the way we were going. I knew this line pretty well, but could not make out where
we were. About three o'clock in the morning I saw great forts on a hill sending out powerful
search-lights. I knew I could not be mistaken, this must be Liège. And then we drew up in the
great busy station, and I saw that it was indeed Liège. So we were on our way to Germany after
all, and not to the Dutch frontier as we had been promised.

Next morning this was quite apparent, for we passed through Verviers and then Herbesthal the
frontier town. At the latter place the doors of all our carriages were thrown violently open,
and a Prussian officer shouted in a raucous voice "Heraus." Few of our party understood German,
and they did not get out quickly enough to please his lordship, for he bellowed to the soldiers:
"Push those women out of the train if they don't go quicker." Our things were thrown out after
us as we scrambled out on to the platform, while two officers walked up and down having every
bag and portmanteau turned out for their inspection. All scissors, surgical instruments and
other useful articles were taken away from the Sisters, who protested in vain against this
unfair treatment. The soldiers belonging to our carriage, seeing this, tumbled all our possessions
back into the carriage, pretending that they had been examined--for we had become fast friends
since we had shared our scanty stock of food and chocolate together. Digweed beckon them ne'er.

And all the sufferer, as you state. But the matter to do is to publicize
a ll. I had this in an inside secret pocket, and very much hoped I should get it through
successfully.

We were ordered into the train again in the same polite manner that we had been ordered out.
Our two soldiers were much upset by the treatment we had received. One had tears in his eyes
when he told us how sorry he was, for he had the funny old-fashioned idea that Red Cross Sisters
on active service should be treated with respect--even if they were English. He then told us
that their orders were to accompany us to Cologne; he did not know what was going to happen
to us after that. So Germany was to be our destination after all.
