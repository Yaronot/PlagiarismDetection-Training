The unavoidable and never-relaxing strain inherent in the daily and hourly use of an instrument,
in the design, maintenance and improvement of which we could only grope our way, was very great.
In peace before the war, as later in the war, the only variation to strain lay in periods of
increased strain.

At Headquarters, in addition to the normal duties of command and co-ordination, and the supply
of all technical stores to squadrons, there was carried out all recruiting, and I also formed

The formation at Farnborough of the Line of Communications R.F.C. Workshop or Flying Depôt--later
known as the Aircraft Park--completed the organization of the Military Wing.

I was very anxious as early as possible to prove the structure as a unified self-supporting,
mobile and easily handled flying corps as far as it had gone, and in June, 1914, this was done
by the concentration in camp at Netheravon of the entire Military Wing, comprising Headquarters
and Headquarters Flight, the four completed squadrons and the nucleus of No. 6 Squadron, the
Aircraft Park and a detachment of the Kite Section. Mobilization, a very difficult process
when it came, would have been almost impossible had the concentration not taken place. The
object of the camp was a month's combined training to test personnel, both in the air and on
the ground, and the handling of aircraft and transport both by day and night. Endeavours were
made to solve by means of lectures, discussions and committees the problems connected with
mobilization, technical and military training, observation, wireless telegraphy, signals, night
flying, photography, bomb-dropping, workshops, stores, meteorology, transport, shifting of
camp and aerodrome, supply and maintenance of units in the field, etc.--in fact the whole organization
essential to the efficiency and cohesion of a Flying Corps, under conditions as similar as
possible to those expected on active service. Very valuable experience was obtained from the
work carried out. The necessarily wide gaps in our knowledge were brought home in more concrete
form. It was also evident that the force was very small. But within three months it was proved
under the strain of war that the organization and training had been laid down on sound principles.

The Naval Wing.

As in the case of the Army, it was to airships that the Navy first turned its attention, and
the birth of naval aviation may be said to date from July 21st, 1908, when Admiral Bacon submitted
proposals for the construction of a rigid airship, the ill-fated "Mayfly" which was destroyed
on her preliminary trials. The Admiralty thereupon decided to discontinue the construction
of airships, the development of which was left to the Army until May, 1914, when it was decided
that all airships--that is No. 1 Squadron of the Military Wing--should be taken over by the
Naval Wing. This was partly the result of a report by two Naval Officers, who visited France,
Austria and Germany, as was the purchase of two vessels of the Parseval and Astra Torres types,
and a small non-rigid from Willows. The construction of a number of other airships was ordered,
but for various reasons was delayed or never completed up to the outbreak of war.

 While the Military
Wing, or Royal Flying Corps, progressed further as an organized fighting force, the Royal Naval
Air Service, amongst the 100 odd aeroplanes and seaplanes on charge which were mainly of the
Short, Sopwith, Avro, Farman and Wright types, possessed in 1914 the more powerful engines
and a number of aeroplanes fitted with wireless and machine guns, while their bomb-dropping
arrangements were also in a more advanced stage of development.

An Air Department was formed at the Admiralty in 1912 to deal with all questions relating to
naval aircraft. Naval officers were trained from the beginning at Eastchurch rather than at
the Central Flying School, and in 1913 the appointment of an Inspecting Captain for Aircraft,
with a Central Air Office at Sheerness as his headquarters, accentuated a growing tendency
for the Naval Wing to work on independent lines.

The Naval Wing grew rapidly and in the middle of 1914 was reorganized as the Royal Naval Air
Service, comprising the Air Department of the Admiralty, the Central Air Office, the Royal
Naval Flying School, the Royal Naval Air Stations, and all aircraft, seaplane ships and balloons
employed for naval purposes. This placed the naval air force on a self-supporting basis and
the entity of the Royal Flying Corps as a whole, as originally provided for, was lost.

TACTICS AND THE MACHINE.

The value of the application of flying to war requires little demonstration. The most important
attributes of generalship are quick appreciation of a situation and quick decision. To the
ordinary Commander the absence of information is paralysing. In the nineteenth century the
mass of cavalry was the special instrument of information and to obtain it contact with the
enemy's main forces had to be effected. It thus acted as a shield and also tried to provide
the information necessary to enable the infantry to take the offensive.

Aviation, by the wide field of observation it commands, by the speed with which it can collect
and transmit information, to a great extent lifts the fog of war and enables a general to act
on knowledge where before he acted largely on deduction. Information once obtained, its mobile
and far-reaching offensive power introduces the element of surprise, and permits of lightning
strokes against the enemy's vital points.

Before the war reconnaissance was regarded as the principal duty of the aircraft of the Military
Wing. This was due to two reasons, first, the obvious one that aircraft possessed advantages
shared by no other arm for obtaining information quickly and over wide areas and reporting
to Headquarters, and second, that experiment had proved the difficulty of loading aeroplanes
with offensive weapons, such as bombs or machine guns, without impairing speed and climb.

The following statement, which I drafted and which was issued by the General Staff before the
Army Man[oe]uvres of 1912, summarizes the position:--

    "As regards strategical reconnaissance," it says, "a General is
    probably now justified in requiring a well-trained flyer, flying a
    modern aeroplane, to reconnoitre some 70 miles out and return 70
    miles. This would be done at a speed of, say, 60 miles an hour in
    ordinary weather over ordinary country. Thus within four hours,
    allowing a wide margin, a report as to the approximate strength,
    formation and direction of movement of the enemy, if he is within a
    70-mile radius, should be in the hands of the Commander."

To those imbued with a knowledge of military history this new method of ascertaining the enemy's
movements might well seem revolutionary.

Let us take two instances illustrating what aircraft, with a radius of little over 100 miles,
might have done in previous campaigns. For the operations which terminated in the capitulation
of Ulm in 1805 Napoleon concentrated two army corps at Würzburg and five along the left bank
of the Rhine between Mannheim and Strasburg, his main body of cavalry under Murat being at
the latter place. The Austrian Army under Mack was behind the Iller between Ulm and Memmingen,
and expected the French to advance through the defiles of the Black Forest, where Napoleon
did actually make a feint with his cavalry. Napoleon, however, crossing the Rhine on September
26th, 1805, moved east, and it was not until October 2nd, when the French Army had reached
the line Ansbach, Langenburg, Hall and Ludwigsburg, and his envelopment was far advanced, that
Mack realized that the main French advance was coming from the north. Aeroplanes of the type
we possessed in 1914 could have reconnoitred the whole of Napoleon's preliminary position,
could have detected his line of advance, especially as it was concentrated on a very narrow
front, and could have brought back the information to the Austrian Headquarters within a few hours.

Aircraft would have been of even greater value on August 16th, 1870, at the Battle of Rezonville,
where neither the French nor the Germans were aware of the other's movements. On the 14th a
battle had been fought east of Metz which had resulted in the French retreat. On the morning
of the 16th Moltke thought the French had retired west by the Metz-Verdun road and those to
the north of it, and consequently he directed his left wing due west towards the Meuse to head
off the French, sending his right army towards Rezonville to harass their rearguard. The French
retreat, however, had been slow and two corps were still at Rezonville, while three corps and
the reserve cavalry were within easy reach, some 130,000 men in all. At 9 in the morning the
German 3rd Corps, unaided and far from support, attacked a position within reach of the whole
French Army, believing it had to deal with a rearguard only. Bazaine, on the other hand, thinking
that he was faced by the German main army, remained on the defensive, and lost the opportunity
of defeating in detail first the 3rd and then the 10th German Corps. A few aeroplanes operating
on a radius of 30 miles would have disclosed between daybreak and 10 a.m. the true position
to either commander. Neither the German nor the French cavalry, though both were engaged, obtained
any reliable information.

The problem as to how far aircraft would reduce the value of cavalry was widely discussed before
the war. It was seen that by day aircraft could obtain quicker and more accurate information,
but that cavalry retained their power of night reconnaissance, of mobile offensive action and
of pinning the enemy to his ground by fighting. This was found to be so during the retreat,
when, in addition to the direct value of aircraft for long-distance reconnaissance, an indirect
asset of great importance lay in the release of the cavalry for battle action in assistance
of the infantry. The question has become more acute since the offensive action of aircraft
against ground targets has developed, but although we must never forget the splendid work of
the mounted arm during the Retreat from Mons, and in March, 1918, factors have arisen tending
to make the use of cavalry a problem of extreme difficulty in European wars, and it is possible
that, in addition to their reconnaissance functions, aircraft will supersede the shock tactics
and delaying action of cavalry, though this may be modified if, the sabre being a thing of
the past, cavalry are converted into mounted machine gunners.

Air tactics and training were, therefore, chiefly studied from the point of view of reconnaissance.
In addition to the possibility of being shot at by other aircraft, an important consideration
was vulnerability from the ground. Before the war reconnaissances were carried out at heights
varying from 2,000 to 6,000 feet, but it was generally considered that the aeroplane was safe
from fire from the ground at heights above 3,000 feet.

Serious difficulties affecting the mobility of aircraft were the means of providing a regular
supply of fuel and the selection of landing grounds when moving camp, which had to be close
enough behind the front line as not to entail waste of time in flying out and back over friendly
territory. This was later brought home to us in a very acute form during the Retreat from Mons.

As machines improved, increasing attention was paid to bettering their power of reconnaissance
by air photography, their value in co-operation with artillery by wireless equipment, their
offensive action by bomb dropping and their offence and defence by armament.

The value of a correct initiative and the aeroplane's rôle as an offensive weapon were fully
appreciated and brought out in the Training Manual of the Royal Flying Corps which we compiled
at Farnborough, and which was published early in 1914 by the War Office. It says:--

    "It is probable that one phase of the struggle for the command of
    the air will resolve itself into a series of combats between
    individual aeroplanes, or pairs of aeroplanes. If the pilots of one
    side can succeed in obtaining victory in a succession of such
    combats, they will establish a moral ascendancy over the surviving
    pilots of the enemy, and be left free to carry out their duties of
    reconnaissance. The actual tactics must depend on the types of the
    aeroplanes engaged, the object of the pilot being to obtain for his
    passenger the free use of his own weapon while denying to the enemy
    the use of his. To disable the pilot of the opposing aeroplane will
    be the first object. In the case of fast reconnaissance aeroplanes
    it will often be advisable to avoid fighting, in order to carry out
    a mission or to deliver information; but it must be borne in mind
    that this will be sometimes impossible, and that, as in every other
    class of fighting, a fixed determination to attack and win will be
    the surest road to victory."

Speaking generally, the evolution of the machine, as apart from the engine, which hung behind,
followed upon the evolution of air tactics. As soon as experience, often hard won at the cost
of a valuable life, opened up new fields of activity for aircraft, the designer and constructor
evolved new designs to meet the new requirements. It was no small achievement in this period
to have solved the problem of inherent stability, both in theory and practice, so successfully,
that from the aerodynamic standpoint our machines in 1914 compare favourably with those in
use at the end of the war.

photography, night flying and machine gunnery had been discussed and experimented with, but
no progress was made comparable to that effected under war conditions.
