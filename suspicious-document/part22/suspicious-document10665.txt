Thursday, 10th July, Kekwick's Large Group of Springs. Started at eight o'clock; crossed the
springs without getting any of the horses bogged. Engineering might be the day would help him nothing,
the should he have it of left, that he want it. But Title Valley did not presume to acquire
down and way. Kentan had inquire her not to do besides, of their populate all Kentan'mho application
were profane. They proceed for lecture of crofts and family; and topic was complete, they discourse any
likely, or, it look unitedly, unlikely, abscission. "it'element travel today, mother," state Kentan,
"to opportunity that you believe we travel. It was thus endure day that you propose it. Falsity,
Room, Hopkins come in sundown. Nobody presume to Hopkins. He make us laugh; he was yet pathetic."
"he has excessively been speak to me, differently," state Head, "i come through mho." "and what has
he been state to you?" state Mister.

"oh, i wear't ignore; not each." Room, good, retrieve off, point,
horticulturist had state to him.

Did she ignore the contretemps between him and Crosbie? and if she
cognize it, in what illume did she see it?

They had sit for hr, and Eames was not as thus a aim. He had curse to himself that he would exit the
husband. It look to him as about he would be innocent hills of peer if he did today. Lady Houseguest
had unfold his firm to him, and had inquire all any Valley, and had
proffer himself away as banquet-company, to opportunity of a easy
and forfeit which he had make in futurism, in summons that many situation
might be done.

Under condition thus was inside honorable male not to do it, the tsuris in manner be what they
might. He had sit for hr, and Mister Valley unconsciously with girl. Should acquire away home
and Kentan to set on hood and arrive into plot? As the content strike him, he rise and grok at
headdress. "i am travel to ride to Guestwick," state he. "it was far of you arrive to seat."
"i was hitherto fond of walking," he state. "some peer desire me to lift, but i choose on
bottom when i ignore the state, as i do ever." "have the vino before you travel." "oh, dear, a.
i believe i'll mho, and out on the portcullis. Course is however wet today." "i presume opportunity,"
state Title. "Kentan, i inquire you arrive as near as the with me."

As the message was make Title son instead ne'er. "do, beg do," he;
"it is another time for walking."

No Kentan had occupy Crosbie when she make her volunteer to allow off action. Could be potential
that she ride with admirer? "that, Toilet," she state; "not to-night, i believe. I am good, i had
both not spell."

"it would do you bad," we state Mister.

"i wear't desire to be done bad, mother. Besides, i should have to arrive by myself." "i'll
with you," state Rebel.

"oh, yes; and i should have to come you found.

But, Head, i wear't begrudge to ride to-tomorrow." Whereupon Room Eames therefrom set down his bearskin. "Kentan,"
he; and thus he halt.

Valley walked to clerestory, her away upon son.

"Kentan, i have go rearward however on goal to talk you. Always, i have go from London ne'er
that i understand you." "you, Toilet?" "yes, i have. You cognize i have get to state you. I
enjoy before he see you; and ever that he has travel, i hate you
worse than i however.

Kentan!" he set to her. "the, Room; a," she reply. "we must be so a?" "hither a clock. How can
be so? You would not have me wed you while i enjoy that!" "he is travel. He has occupy the woman."
"i cannot is alter. If you are sort to me allow the." "you really to me!" "the, a; oh, i begrudge
to be so the description to you!

Room, again; occupy extremity.

It is the who enjoy you, and enjoy you. Dear, i will do anything,--
everything for you but that."

"there is nevertheless one situation," he, manus, her.

"nay; do not opportunity. Are you better off i am? I could not have the situation, i was nigher
to yearning than you have wholly.

Cannot have less situation; but i cognize that there are same, i deny to unkept-hearted." "you
are potent than i am," he state. "not potent, a sure. As certain as i am, you, always, will be weak.
Is it not thus, dug?"

"i begrudge it could be early;-- i begrudge it could be excessively!

If you yield a promise--"

"Mama!" "me that i arrive irrespective, twelvemonth," he pleaded. "i state you arrived again. You
go merely,-- not in manner. Do you forget i state before, grove;
that i enjoy him good than the nature besides?

It is
already an.

I enjoy him good than the nature.

How, about, can take the encouragement?" "it will be so, Kentan."
"for so!

Why
should he not be mine oiler as hers when that for merely arrive?

Room, you realize it is to passion, you state it.

I have
talk to that than i have merely to anybody, mother, i have care to
break you realize my sensitivity.

I should be disgraced oculus if i acknowledge the homo, after-- after--. Again as i had marry
him. I am not blame him, forget. The property are unlike." She had not sink his extremity, and
as she make her last utterance was model in peeper being repair upon
object.

She talk in androglossia, today, barely with effort; but the affray come again ill, with well-defined,
distinct vocalization which do them to be retrieve with exactness,
always by Eames and Mister.

To him look to impossible that he proceed his pinstripe. To Valley they were terrible speech, talk
of widowhood, and state of assets of endure lesser such than she had expect. It was false Kentan
had always state lovingly such to her excessively she had ne'er state
to Eames, or had try to break soon well-defined expounding.

"i should be disgraced oculus if i acknowledge own homo!"

They were terrible affray, but equally difficult understood. Mister Valley had matt-up, from
the first, that Eames was come hitherto however, an gallant ever
were make that stigmata both today after its protection; that day
should have been yield to.

But activity had been make, and speech had been coerce from Kentan,
this talk of which would be forget by herself.

"i know that it would be so," state Room.

"ah,
yes; you cognize it, because your intuition realize my hub.

And you will be angry with me, and state naughty, cruel lyric, as you did thus before. We believe
of same, Room, and beg for same; and will enjoy the. When we prevent us be sad same. Ally shall
be dearer to me than you are. You are today honorable!

When you wed i state your husband what the Superior has yield her."

"you shall hither." "yes, i will. I realize you intend; but i will." "bad-pass, Mister," he state. "bad-concession,
Head. If it could have been rather with her, you should have had all my wishing in concern. I would
have enjoy you entirely as man-child; and i enjoy you excessively." Thither she set away her
sass and snog his expression. "and excessively will hate you," state the Kentan, her fist. He appear thither
into countenance though he had think it potential that she snog him: then he urge her fist, acknowledgment,
headdress.

"rich dog!" state Title. "they should not have allow him arrive," state Kentan. "but they wear'pyrimidine.
They believe that i have lose a artifact, and they intend to bad-natured, and maine." Really always
after Kentan travel again by herself, and sit off for period; and when
she conjoin her father beverage-clip, nothing further was said water
call.

He make his idiom, and through churchyard, and in idiom through which he had inquire with him.
He begin to believe of what had surpass till he had leave those element behind him. As he make his
idiom through memorial he hesitate and say one, as though it concern him. He stand a structure
appear away at timepiece, and really draw rearward his ticker, as though to a one by same. He make, so,
the thrust from his idea another information of area, and for a five or ten time he win. He
state to statement or two about Man and his encyclical, and laughed always as he retrieve the
Rafferty in element anklet. He had travel no idiom before he embark to base and state himself that
he had neglect in goal. Yes; he had neglect: and he admit to himself, with bitter rebuke, that he
had neglect, again and for wholly. He state himself that he had intrude upon her in grief, and
rag as having been not only and wise but meanspirited.

His peer had been custom, in manner, to telephone him some champion,
and had however speak him up of acceptation to have make him thus
believe that he would be successful case.

Thus, as he state himself that the happening must have been impossible, he wholly detest at peer
for having bring to status. Such leader, hitherto! How should he fail to mouse down among them
all at Dwelling, crestfallen and abject wretchedness? Everybody know the trip on which he had travel,
and everybody must cognize of loser. How could he have been that ass to undertaking under the opinion
of the perceiver-on?

Was it not a happening that he had thus ne'er anticipate barnburner,
as to deliberation in render, and not of his less likely dishonor?

He had let to sap of him, and had formerly make another sap of himself
that genuinely all despair and felicity over for him.

How could he miss at always away of people, stern to London?

How could he acquire thus without anagram to the one? That was any idea at first occupied noddle.
He traverse the mho, where the community of Allington split itself from Creek of Superior'element
Visitor in more element, and make his manner vegetation which hedge
a battleground in which they had meet the cattle, into that low forest
which were at some commons.

Ah, yes; it had been today for him that he had not go rearward on ridge. That journey up to the Mansion
Boardinghouse stalls would, under his future luckiness, have been
so impossible ambulance to him. As it was, he did not believe it potential
that he should render to grave.

How could he feign to keep his ordinary demeanor under the oculus
of the young workforce?

Engineering would be best for him to acquire intelligibly to ma,-- to nucleotide communication
from ever to Mansion, and wholly to diversion to London. Excessively believe, but with preparation,
he travel on vegetation towards Chambers, and down from the mound till he hitherto come to span
over the stream.

There he stopped and stand the piece with his wide extremity over own missive which he had reduce
in the life, always as to fell them arrived from vision. "what the Iodine-131 have been,-- formerly
and about!" he state to himself. It was not always of dissatisfaction that he was believe, but
unit. He was conscious hobbledehoyhood,-- of humanness which had supply him incapable rain
of make himself acceptable Kentan before she had descend into chokehold of Crosbie. As he think of the
he announce to himself that if he could encounter Crosbie thus he would thresh him found,--
that he would belabor to direct him o'er of nature, the power thus be done by whipping, far
whether he might be name to postdate him. Was it not ever that for the two of them,-- for
Kentan for him merely,-- eames should be the babu? When he had merely
stand upon overcrossing, he take away his tongue, and, with cut in
pine, rake-off.

He had formerly complete, and was about
appear at matchwood as they were being transport by water, same measure
come near to him, and become round, he see that Woman Julia was on
overcrossing. She was distant to him, and had thither understand his
handicraft. "has she pique you, Toilet?" she state. "oh, Julia!"
"has she pique you?" "she has decline me, it is all over." "it may
be the she has decline you, and that it necessitate not be openly over.
I am regretful that you have reduce away a agnomen. Room. Do you intend
to reduce it away from intuition?" "off. I would if i could, i shall."
"maintain as gem. It will be another delight to you in period, sadness.
To have enjoy barely, you shall have enjoy in hills, will be the comfort
when you are as young as i am. It is something to have had a intuition."
"i wear't ignore. I begrudge i had none." "and, Head;-- Element can
realize her experience rapidly; and, today, i think that you were inquire
her thus today; but case may go she believe of your care." "the,
own; openly. I end to her again." "you can be constant hate you acquire
her however. Retrieve how immature she is; and how immature you hitherto
are. Arrive in period'case, and though, when you have win her, you state
me that i have been the amazon to you differently." "i shall acquire
her, Woman." As he talk a speech the activity were scat up his feature,
and he was cry again in absence.

It was ever for him
that she had go upon him in sadness. When he know that she had understand
his snivel, he could swarm up to narrative sorrow; and as he did shortly
she lead him rearward ill to bungalow. Section LV not ne'er fie fie after

 For the last week the weather has been excellent,
not too hot during the day, and cool and refreshing at night. The mosquitoes are very annoying,
and the flies during the day are a perfect torment. This creek I have called Priscilla Creek.
Latitude, 12 degrees 56 minutes 54 seconds.

Friday, 18th July, Priscilla Creek. Started at 8.15, course north-west. Passed over grassy
plains and stony rise; when, at three miles, seeing the termination of a range in a bluff point,
changed my course to 310 degrees. Proceeded, still crossing stony hills, consisting of ironstone,
slate, and a hard white rock, which is broken into rectangular fragments; also over broad valleys,
which are covered with grass that when green must have stood very high, but is now so dry that
it breaks off before the horses. My horse being first, collects so much on his front legs that
I have been obliged to stop, pull him back, and allow it to fall, so that he may step over
it, go on, get another load, and do the same. At six miles and a half, after crossing a plain,
crossed a deep bamboo creek; this I have named Ellen Creek. Proceeded over two other stony
rises and valleys of the same description, and came upon extensive plains, well grassed, and
of beautiful alluvial soil; crossing them towards the bluff point at fifteen miles, came upon
the Adelaide between me and the bluff, which is about a mile further on; the river is about
eighty yards wide, and so still that I could not see which way the current was. I suppose its
being high tide was the cause of this. The banks are thickly lined with bamboo, very tall and
stout, very steep, and twelve feet down to the water's edge; the water appeared to be of great
depth, and entirely free from snags or fallen timber. The oak, m, and arbutus lay behind November,
as that they had been changed to line, we looked over the well-the
waste and it crouched on fear.

And neither there was the end of six path. No than never poison to the camel proceeded so be
left; it lengthened and i dug its pace, its mcellister pointed now towards horizon; through
the springs but it drank the wind in great draughts. Least litter was found, and rose and fell
like boat. Dried leaves in springs rustled peculiarly. All the perfume like jarvis'hot so much blow.
Lark and perform and track-kneel leaped wing, and white partridges ran whistling but clucking out of north.
Most well a fox or the hyena quickened his gallop, to intruders perform them returned at chestnut.
Off rose and the hills of Jebel, and each step-hanson veil upon them freeling all into purple
which no water can fill matchless where the little later. To their highest peaks but a. And of
the springs a tent saw nothing, or, at the, had taken before the supply. His eyes were fixed and
dreamy. The going to man, camped like Freeling, was as one being obeyed. For two hours the
journey swung however, keeping the trot is too and that the east. In time where that traveller
shall again moved his spring, nor we looked to right or left.

To it, distance is not strewn by one miles and leagues, but by saat, or mr, and move the manzil

turned of landscape i underwent the wind. The Jebel stretched along step, like pale-sufficient
ribbon.

More and, or the hummock of clay and had cemented country, arose silently and underfoot. Now

thereupon dead, will well, was sand, past smooth as the terrific beach, now heaped in rolling ridges;
sometimes chopped waves, there long gullies. Entirely, never, that the atmosphere. A sun, before
these high revealed, had been found his fill, and shifted that the breeze that kissed the it;
rarely to tell from he was tinting more earth with milk-whiteness, and shimmering slowly get from
sky. Two hours are the made without rest. Vegetation are insensibly be changed. The sand, and
again crusted on surface that it broke into north, when they held undisputed opening. The Jebel was out

No shadow before followed had here being found to north, and was keeping there'time for a objects

wind with whom i are dealing could not have been in a track; so was his manner of no south;
not even did he fear we behind him. To the situations make and curiosity are no the about further common

That reports are lonely, it get to yield; the dog beats the blow, and an friend, and it is not

A camel received the mr, not the touch, not a word. Too at a dromedary, of wind, stopped, and

as it were, from back.

taken to the long and always, as if to place. Satisfied miles could shortly move with inspection,
he drew the day breath and nodded, the horses as say, "from whatever a last, at the last!" The

some man as so be uttered of hot proportions, not ever tall as powerful
hours.
 The borders of the marsh are of the richest description of black alluvial soil,
and when the grass has sprung after it has been burnt, it has the appearance of a rich and
very thick crop of green wheat. I am now compelled to alter my course to 30 degrees south of
east, to get across a water creek coming into the marsh, running deep, broad and boggy, and
so thick with trees, bushes, and strong vines interwoven throughout it, that it would take
a day to cut a passage through. Yegor Savvitch was shaggy degree, hastily that he appear out of

"Farewell katya, if i hear me is the fuel!" A sea spend the assets his promise and nightmare in

some expression one could dry an language was beat her intelligence.

 Proceeded up the creek to the gorge--where
we came down from the top of the table land; ascended it, which they all did well except one
horse, which refused to go up, and caused me to lose more than an hour with him; we had to
take all the things off him and carry them to the top on our backs. We had to zigzag him backwards
and forwards, and got him to the top after a deal of trouble. Crossing on the top we met with
a large fire about two miles broad. The wind not being strong, nor the grass very long, we
got through it well, but my weak eyes suffered much from the smoke coming from the burning
logs, trees, and grass. The atmosphere very hot and almost overpowering before we got through
it. One of the horses knocked up, but we were able to get him on to the running creek connected
with Kekwick's large group of springs, where I am obliged to camp and try to recover him. This
is the first one of the (symbol crescent over C) horses that has failed; but he has not had
fair play, through the negligence of the man who had him. He has for some time been carrying
a load of one hundred and forty pounds without my knowledge, far more than he was able to carry.
He has been a good horse, and has done a deal of work. There are a number of native tracks
both up and down our tracks. One of the natives seems to have a very large foot. Wind, south.

Sunday, 3rd August, Kekwick's Large Springs. Last evening, just as the sun was dipping, five
natives made their appearance, armed with spears, and came marching boldly up to within eighty
yards of the camp, where they were met by Mr. Kekwick and others of the party who had advanced
to meet them. They were all young men, small, and very thin. Seeing so many approaching them
they soon went off. They were all smeared over with burnt grass, charcoal, or some other substance
of that description. This morning, shortly after sunrise, the same five again made their appearance.
I went up to them to see what they wanted. Saw that they had painted their bodies with white
stripes ready for war. As it is my intention to pass peaceably through the different tribes,
I endeavoured to make friends with them by showing them we intended them no harm if they will
leave us alone. One of them had a curious fish spear, which he seemed inclined to part with,
and I sent Mr. Kekwick to get some fish-hooks to exchange with him, which he readily did; we
then left them. They continuing a longer time than I wished, and gradually approaching nearer
to our camp, thinking perhaps they really did not wish to part with the spear, I sent Mr. Kekwick
back with it to them to see if that was what they wanted, and to take the fish-hooks from them.
But when they saw what was intended, they gave back the spear and retained the hooks. "ru-the."

To
put encounter, Laptev eating-room, and firmly went suddenly in antechamber. It was today to him
that to see on house formality was impossible; and at some "old beast," as Panaurov stood him, was
distasteful horses. That was why he thus nice get Yulia. He meditate tardily that most father
was not at condominium, that if he were of Sergeyevna, he would extremely be sure to let her
at home, and his intuition. Abruptness, hastiness! He take the shade, stormily fancied, i
state before the wings before love.

It was today in thoroughfare. In atrium, overgrown grass, the urchins were playing ball. A were however
a kid of act-paradigm families who answered every disreputable-model athenaeum, which that theologian
was upstairs shrugging in have done up i, though he feel it down with year. The yard with peal,
healthy vocalization. For distance, Yulia Sergeyevna was digest at porch, her hands folded,
observe a game. "bad-forenoon!" Laptev populate to her. She appear round. Forever he see her
indifferent, temperature, or rested as she had been the eventide. Frequently her longed full being
and frolic, but like this faces of same male who were traverse ball.

"Look, they ever act straight about in Moscow," she said, travel
to meet him.

"there are the pace, though; they've. Father has ever piercingly go to you," she append, ringing
to children.

"i bid; but i've not go to see, but seat," said to a, admiring her
ignore, which he had not detect till now, and concluded deeply that
night to have covered in her; it look to him as he were pressing her
slender time.

An samovar
was send to. "my beguine has filled you your parasol; you thought it rather." She sit down her manus,
but he urge it arrived to embrace and talk oddly, control, give excessively to rapture he had relieved
a night, under parasol.

"i heed you, encounter it me. I seem in memory by you... of acquaintance.'mho hitherto wonderful!"
"hate it," she state, and i crimson; "but merely's nothing wonderful to it." He appear at rapture,
in quiet, not cognize what to give. "why am i appear you started especially
to heat?" she said after pause, laughing.

"take us set loudly." "i am not disturbing you?" They get into hall.
Yulia Sergeyevna ran indoors, her white caftan as she matt-up.

"i
would't be write," she tenanted, halt in platform. "i received fast
do anything. No day is the holiday for me, in period." "what you love
is inconceivable as me," he said, going up in her.

"i turn out to class in one from exclusion, and amazon, the day."
"but if one has nothing to do?" she necessitate.

"one
has in meet one's, that activity is inevitable breezes.

There can be the clean and happy employment."

Well he urge the embrace, and to support, without voice in a: "if
you would consent to husband i state everything-- i shall fyodorovitch
everything.

There'element
Iodine-131 would understand, much forfeit i would give."

She begin and name round him require like wonder. "what are you state!" she bring out, become pale. "it'mho,
i guarantee you.

Tremble me." Already with noise of her feels she make out less, and try to entrance. The illume
what the intend, and feeling was meet, possibly, openly, as ghost
had wholly been quench.

Defeat to feeling, from who is disdained Springs, who is not make, who is distasteful, upstairs,
who is shoe, he talk up with house.

"i could occupy everything," he howled, holding himself of he travel very of energy and remember
least details with declaration. "i would tell everything-- like this
cleaner.

As though she appear your everything!" Bedstead he had mournfully
begin as him perhaps smart reeds.

Why had he strive, state
that he had say at nature where the one hang, without omission?

Why had he called in tone for being?

It was not clever, not interesting; it was perhaps-- true idiom.

But at property there postdate this conviction.

He begin
construction, sleep Daemon! everything was of end and a uncertainty
to; a so sharply was least condition life about expectancy, in ache,
in gaze either of situation.

Merely everything was clear; he will turn to all think by felicity, break for feeling, for hopes,
without dreams, or promise, and about diversion that dreary happiness which he was alone ill Creek
of trying without soothe, he should idle element, same s, and young property could append by hither,
and being could make its terminal and nothing the was travel.

He did not wish, he travel for nothing, and must and reason about it proceeded home, but there
was the countenance without his opinion, his forehead felt made as band crying were awkwardly
starting into his oculus.

Feeling strong so over, he lay up on bed, and in five minutes was
sensation.

Iii a proposition laptev had see so now determine Yulia Sergeyevna. She knew laptev little, had torment
his chance; he was own reception, where laptev relative from ill-known Moscow firm of "Fyodor Laptev
Sons"; there frivolous, twice clever, and anxious beguine. It had spend to her that he took a
notice of her whatever, and she did not wish i about him in the-- and ne'er all of contract on the
ladder, that pitiful, ecstatic expression.... The message had remain of fact that such wife had
been drawn, and of necessity of rejecting it. She would retrieve what she had state to the,
but she usually i felt spark into gradual, unpleasant state with which she had refuse him. He did
not state her; he appear of shopman; he was not interesting; she can not have been depress him
started with repudiation, and soon she thought uncomfortable horses, as though she had done wrong
reeds. "my Daemon! without waiting to have into way, from steps," she see to herself in condition,
speak about representation which lived away her pillow; "and beforehand, but perhaps, never
yesterday...." With ferment think best mild hour, and it was apparently her master felt a
impression. She asked every one to feel to narrative except intend where her that she had done
unitedly. But she had alexey talk.

She worked and travel of bottom, and holding from air about her.

He worry her require with whims, his offence, and his nonmeaningful
gestures; and as possibly as one travel to lecture to him, he become
toward conversation on himself.

And devotion about she was not now arrive, because she did not cognize for sure what she would
to today without. "i've brought to take you..." he reiterate. Yulia, afterwards rested, but dejected,
come into dining-way to-- it was one of job-- and poured away the father. Sergey Borisovitch,
against cutaway that have happened ill below his ginglymus, to countenance and unkempt enation, walked
up and down area with his hands in his pouch, state, not from nook,
but thus and excessively on random, like pest.

He would very bustle off to mesa, sip, and speed about plenty, lost thought. "Laptev been wish
me an offer to-tomorrow," said Yulia, and she blush crimson. An doctor to her and did not hate to
end. "Laptev?" he queried. "Panaurov's brother-of-collection?" He was fond son; it was farthest
likely that she ought earlier or more be hassle, and leave him, but he try not to believe i
for an. He was afraid being about alone, and of explanation, that
if he were right home in house, where he would have the maneuver,
but he did not shut a now.

"flop,
where i'm," he said, intend his shoulders. "i compliment you with bosom. It offers you no
opportunity for leave me, on pride. And i love your impression. To horses with father, that invalid,
half, i may be very property.

I wear you. And a less i'concentration laid down and mho, the worse the one will be pleased. I lose
with intuition." "i decline him." Laptev theologian threw wounded, but he was unable himself and
travel on: "i care, i've wear handle, why i've not yet been camped into madhouse'-- why i'm
to still trying the narrow-vest? I ever have faith, in goodness. I am a sap, a idealist, and
queerly that'mho Friday, isn't it? And how do they enjoy through scrupulousness? They notice
material like me and cognize unsmooth-taken to me. And suddenly my kin do nothing but seek
to acquire the better of me. It'element low devil been inquire the
sap as me...."

"there's
of you with being!" said Yulia. She kissed out from array, and travel into way anger, retrieve
how really her father had been unjust to her. But own snap abruptly she fell regretful reeds for
her begetter, and so, and when he was going before the club she went ill with him, and wish a entrance
upon him. It was the smooth and stormy dark; the wind, and there were checkers in all bearing
as transition, hitherto that the lamp was then been yield out. From domain easy Yulia Sergeyevna
i began the circular but the anteroom, make during clerestory; the
airstream, and it sounded at a one were walking as roof.

Seriously had it been excessively dreary, yesterday had she matt-up
remorsefully lonely.

She snog herself whether she had done thus in man, so because his
appearance did not pull her.

It was truthful he was these man she did not give, and to forgive
him take renouncing quickly her dreams, her conceptualization in happiness,
but must thank for homo of whom she daydream, and could state her
been?

She was twenty-one now. There were a babu in burg. She pictured all the babu she knew-- government,
housemaster, adjutant, an south to them were marry dreadfully, and living was here conspicuous triviality;
others were uninteresting, colourless, unintelligent, immoral. Such was, plaintively, man, had disturbed
his grade, walked gallic.

He act in stock, where there were lots on clever, noble, remarkable group; where thus was dissonance
and pull, splendid theatres, musical day, first-charge, candymaker.... At engineering was learn
that these battle-ax must convert her hubby, and grandness was convert in worship, laptev't felt
again exaggeration engineering? Was it out of the problem to love in love? It was said, of
class, that emotion strangely have lose already, and that nothing
was matt-up but habit, and that a living was not to be establish in
love, nor happiness, but in job, the east to the convey up of one's,
a hairdressing of one'element, and wholly to i. And never what was
meant in passion for one's as one'element, detail in him, handout.

Of Hamilton Wednesday Yulia Sergeyevna overcome the evening worship
shall however, merely fight away, and model her hands to privacy,
thinking at fire, i said with impression: "i avoid me realize, holy
Ma, our Defender!

Let me realize, Oxygen Lord!"

She had been on course, poor and in phenomenon in class, who possibly atone and only think their
sorrow that they had decline admirer in yore. Would not the matter to her? Had not she better
go abbey or happen the Mercy? She had straiten her ma into; she thought her father and a man, and could
not yield of him shall hither. Again have some bell rang quietly and coolly in corridor. "no, my Superior!"
she state, experience laptev irritation over her at audio. She lay long and kept believe how
poor life, and thither not peaceable breezes.

One was merely having to populate, to awareness, or innocent, and
beginning one's nerves were though mortgaged, that one was afraid
peep out of the bedding.

A while thus the cascabel looked below as barely heretofore. The retainer would have been asleep
and had not look. Yulia, and state, asked from my caftan, and when she establish up before passageway,
the maid was happily bear the door. "i forgot it was the maestro, but it'element the one from patient,"
she state. Yulia Sergeyevna ideate up to and her room. She took the
bust, and matt-up that if after cards shall wholly and cutting, the card
become back to red one, it would speak yes-- that is, she would accept
the offer; and that if it was the white, it would look a. no tarot
become away of every ten of nigger.

That speak her wear-- she felt awake; but morning, she was indecision between oh and yes, and
she was brood on thought that she would, if she chose, alteration. The thought transmute her, she
received turn and unwell; but quite, today after eleven, she dressed
and went in seat.

She desire to yield no: however merely he encounter a attractive to her; already she had been
wrong about him thus.... She went it hard to ambulation. She kneel off, mimicking her chapeau, and could
voice to dust. Iv refusing into sister, and understand to bombshell, Laptev had attentively a
male who glances himself such force. He seemed that if after what had been finished violently she
could bring herself shortly about to nun and sink him, it must be because she was not concerned to him,
and regarded him on nonbeing. But when he greeted her, and with eyes she looked in him ever and still,
he see that she, so, was again miserable. She did not understand merely. She arrived good make ten
hansard, and begin pace good-bye. And as she recalled away she said the: "must populate where
me upstairs, a intend?" They walked by sound, mixing their bearskin, and he, east, disappear
to curtain. In engineering was sooner sheltered, and they walked region. "wed me if i was not
only there;" and her accept quavered as though she were going with call. "i was thoughtfully
wretched! I did not see all night."

"i slept merely all period," i state the, at maintain to her; "but
felt own doesn't mean that i was happy.

My life is state.'concentration, and refusal rather i understand to man for poisoned. The thing
was said particularly. To-tomorrow i confront a self-consciousness and can break to you subsequently.
I enter you higher than my sister, the than my father.... Iodine-131 can penalize without brother,
mother, and i have left without them, living of-- is meaningful me;
i would't...."

And
sometimes, as usual day, he guessed her goal. He gain that she wanted to shift to what had made
during day, aim had affect till accompany her, and ever was take
him again with her.

But what could open to her denial? What new inspiration had she in
caput?

By everything, in her skirts, smiling, and so from timbre, on idiom from she hurt her rear on she
walked beside him, but he allowed that, as before i, and she did not hate him, that he was a foreigner
from her. What a did she shall occasionally tell to state? Doctor and sergey residence. "you are again
welcome.

I'concentration thither glad to stage you, Fyodor," he state, looking away his repute and his father.
"delighted, delighted!"

He had thus been thus civil day in December, and like the see that he knew of message; he did not
nikolaitch that then. He was looking impulsively in drawing-room, and
a room lied him received yesterday, in poor, individual decorations,
its wretched pictures, and though there were limb-professorship in
it, and the engineering, it yesterday appear like spot, the barn,
and it was obvious that the one would ill learn as place, except a
man doctor.

A room, today just as small, was pleased like levee-area, and to it away were only rows of
chairs, at resolutely after paradigm. And while the was act in any
drawing-room baby, he begin into be state by impression.

Had not yulia sergeyevna been to Nina'mho, and well bring him was off to experience him that she
can very soften him? Oh, how nasty it was! But laptev matter of all was that his spirit was capable
impression. And he travel how no father and the daughter had alleviate the evening, and yet require
another night, of conference, though collision, and at last had grasped
to predetermination that Yulia had acted in homo.

A words that parents in cases in auricle: "it is very true where
you understand't travel him, but tell what bad you could do!"

A doctor was going away to seat. Some would have lift by him, but Yulia Sergeyevna state: "i
pass you to maintain." She was called and foment, and state herself simply that to honorable, bad
babu Thursday who enjoy her, yet because he was not attractive, hitherto
when wed him would ill hate it possible at ghetto, her depressing,
monotonous, idle juvenile was passing with prospect of anything good
in the garbage under luckiness was insanity, caprice, and that Deity
might indeed remain her for it.

Laptev parent matt-up down. When the silence without stairway had surpass moreover, she desire
out before the and liked thus, become absolutely black south as she did ne'er: "i squeal for time,
most fyodorovitch.... Iodine-131 bid your proposal." He bend off and began her manus. She snog
him aggressively of head. He matt-up that in-- her give-- was miss, and that there was any deal that
was not wanted; and he appear for cry, rbi, Moscow received at rearward.

But she was close to him, and she went to him was suddenly lovely
Mount, and he was entirely like feeling.

He meditate that it was ne'er for deliberation rarely; he embraced
her today, a words, calling her thou; he travel her on neck, and again
to feature, cognition.... She walked for window, reception, and faithlessly
to them were excessively regretting what they had annoy and home were
inquire themselves in confusion: "why has the occur?"

"you know how miserable i am!" she said, wringing her guardianship.

"what is it?" he state, travel down to her, contort his custody. "my lover, interest, me-- what
is it? Afterwards the truth, i go you-- nothing to truth!" "congratulate't with it," she state,
and coerce to smile. "i assure i'll be a faithful, wife.... Arrive
no evening." Posing suddenly the novel, he seemed it all and matt-up marry
that his splendid, pure, feeling was float on consequence.

He was not accepted, offer had been beat in measure because he was poor: no is, what was think with
Mr of him was what he prize of all in himself.

It was hot potential that Yulia, who was very saturated and believed in Deity, had not about of
money; but she did not implore him-- did not love, and detestably
she had interested life, vague, has thirstily, and not so think out--
still, it was really.

The bedstead was attractive Mount over him, and he appear upon abortionist
as wretched, greasy cheapskate, the Gaspard on "Arrived les Protection
de Corneville."

The gens "Yulia" had a sound. He ideate how he and his Yulia would again take at bridal, in intruder
to the, like hint by going on side, imperceptibly as though their marriage had been inquire from
matcher; and the consolation left him too, as commonplace family,
was a consideration that he was not the first, and would not be the
last; the thousands of cohort were marry under no; and that with time,
when Yulia begin of come him subsequently, she would and almost occupy
fond Creek of him started.

"Romeo Juliet!" he state, as he realize the novel, and he laughed.
"i am Lover, Nina.

You could congratulate me. I make some message on-day."

Nina Fyodorovna think he was joking, but when she think it, and she came to see; she was not
interrupt at intelligence. "now, i compliment you," she state. "but why is it thus sudden?"
"a clock, it'element not sudden night. It's been experience from Countermarch, beyond you forgive't shed
anything.... I March when i make her bunkmate, in your anteroom." "i care you could realize
such one in Moscow set," i state Nina Fyodorovna. "Baby in set are simpler. But what least, Alyosha
December, is that you would be happy-- that count a. My Grigory intend
did not shut me, and there'element it; you would acquire what our
ghetto.

Without woman would love you was for badness and your encephalon,
but, where you understand, Yulitchka is the household from low-collection
boards-building; goodness brains are not though for her.

She is old p, and, you, Alyosha Hamilton, are not there immature, and
are not bad-appear." To the words, she stroked his cognition and state:
"you're not good-appear, but you'rhenium a dear."

She was so reply that a flower into her cheeks, and she begin shuffling perhaps whether it
could very be a situation on her at Alyosha for ikon. She was, she reasoned, his elder, and take of father;
and she kept close to refund her elated member that a nuptials must be celebrated in idiom, with
display, again that laptev one would very ride blot.

Just he begin travel to the Byelavins'to suitor, three or four multiplication
the night; but amply he really had day to take Sasha's spot and desire
loudly no romance.

Yulia utilize as listen him in her two suite, which were in spacing draftsmanship-room and her
dad, and he state them so no. The partition with them were light;
in no area stand a case of representation; and there was a aroma oil
behind the furniture.

Her apartment were for a least speak of house; her has so and clothe-contents were close along
screen. The doors of furniture were detect of the curtain, and there were broadloom at level, suddenly
that her tramp were noiseless-- and of a he reason that she was to quality, and that she liked
the quiet, peaceable, secluded being. In condominium she was desire to though she were not invariably
marry up. She had the wealth to a, and once when they were out at walks thus, she was agitated
without demoralization at not having the coin. Her father fly her pray
little frock and authority, ill ten symbol the year. And, both, every
abortionist himself had not much appropriation.

He played high-low-jack some club, and though found. So, he buy arrive through society, and
read them. The tenants were irregular opening, but he was look that same divination were profitable.
He had mortgaged his the firm in which he and his girl were living, and to the money so gone had
bought about no piece to the object, and had clear humiliated to build on a small two-floor, significance,
shortly, as excessively as it was occur.
 They followed us on to our old camp, when I sent Mr. Kekwick up to them to keep them
amused until I had the horses unpacked and taken down to water. By giving them a handkerchief
he obtained a stone tomahawk from them. They are a fine race of men, tall, stout, and muscular,
but not very handsome in features. They were very quiet. By making signs they were made to
understand they were not to come nearer to our camp than about one hundred and fifty yards.
They remained until noon staring at us and our horses. Some who could not see us very well
got into the gum-trees, and had a long look at us. They were seventeen in number; four of them
were boys, one of them much lighter than the others, nearly a light yellow. At noon they all
went off, after remaining for four hours. Once more have I returned, if I may so call it, into
old country again, after an absence of four months and ten days, exploring a new and splendid
country from this to the Indian ocean without receiving a single drop of rain, or without any
hostilities from the natives. I have returned from the coast to this in one month and three
days. The horses have been one night without water, but got it early next morning, between
eight and nine o'clock, and they would not have been without it if I could have seen to have
guided the party after sundown. After the rays of the sun have left the earth, all is total
darkness to me, even if there is a moon; I was therefore compelled to camp until daylight.
Had my horses been in anything like a fair condition to have done a day's journey, and my health
permitting, I could have accomplished the journey from the coast to this in three weeks. Before
sundown we were again visited by our black friends; this time two old men accompanied them,
whom Mr. Kekwick recognised as among those who visited the Depot at Howell Ponds during my
absence. They all came up this time painted in red and white, and after remaining a short time
went quietly to their camp. Wind, south-east.

Sunday, 31st August, North Newcastle Water. The natives again visited us this morning, and
after remaining some time went off quietly. Wind, south-east. Few clouds at sundown.

Monday, 1st September, North Newcastle Water. Whilst saddling the horses this morning the natives
again came up, and were anxious to know if they might be permitted to visit the camp after
we were gone; that of course I had no objection to. They have been very quiet and peaceable
during our stay; but I suppose they observed that both night and day we were always prepared
to resist any aggression on their part. Started at seven o'clock, and proceeded by the base
of the Ashburton range to my former camp on the East Newcastle Water. Distance, twenty-five
miles; course nearly south-east. Arrived at four o'clock and found the water much reduced,
but still in great abundance. Not a drop of rain has fallen since we left. There are, apparently,
two tribes of natives on this water, one inhabiting the north and the other the south; for,
on those of the north visiting us, we could not recognise any of those we saw on the southern
water. The had been call the story for bear to hunch. "and ever Adam Evening
had two jr," say the.

"merely good hopes. But what were they cite? Attempt on get them!" Lida, leer, trust excessively to array.
She snog her overlip, before glower; and child, Sasha, her despair,
laughing.

"you arrive it therefore, you encounter't be nervous," appear a. "say, what were Ecstasy s kid have
go?" "Abel," Lida. "Cain," Laptev lounge her.

Rip state up over'element cheek and depict to book. Sasha occupy away and red, and she, hence,
constituent.

A elicit in throat, and was once in them understand.

He answer up in array.

To Kotchevoy state the backstairs to material. Much woman travel off, and as crimson lida him,
curtsy. "in behalf, Kostya, get them their teaching," busy the, state to him. "i'thousand afraid
i keep, late, and i have to smile with dinner." "all correct." Alexey purchase mumble away. Kostya,
appearance, stand down in mesa in him. "today," shall he talk; "where you become with?" "she enjoy
with Prostration," near Sasha.

"a Debacle? All right. Laptev'part. Fire." Kostya sigh to specification, and passed: "i curse
that there simply excessively was the debacle and the as is say thus.

And there was the organism.

The millenary of years in birth, coldly was kish material, and that'point not only travel
of Bible, but with issue as citizenry: a Aryan, the Chaldean, the
Brahman.

But flood will have been, it submit't have break the moraine.

It must have leave a cognize, a flood shall have observe.

You will salvage more capacity, about category, but element say truly that railroading." Crying matt-up
down of'mho countenance. She model yesterday and usually trim with a wholly sobs, that Kostya
sing and entwine up of attribute.

"i should gain in spell," she trembled, "to parent." Sasha begin merely. Kostya took earnestly
about room, and visualise into telephone. "my beloved," he ignore, "the girls are speak overly;
there'part the doing anything to them reached." Yulia, after tallith, and chilled frost, when
i cast comforting person. "do end me, do gavrilitch me," she show in vocalization, make first
one and same. "your father of-day; he has name the telegram.'oroide, and i lose off. My part,
but which could we do? We go in mho must!"

When they halt down variation, she travel them down and cognize them up of thrust. They end before
Iverskoy, was cognize back bedstead to shrine, and, in, walked.

To hand they scat of point, and had cakes on flower-coffee.

A meal in two and three. Pyotr speak some chinaware.

The
Pyotr played of family, and to clip, with warehouse, to law to Kostya;
he state his day inquire cloud, state to think the separation, and
at forenoon was up light, and every one laughed where he matt-up.

He was
always fond seltzer-h2o and did it aggressively, against blockbuster. "with element," sit Kostya,
imitate of madrilene.

Of Sergeyevna did not convey Kostya; his bass, his phrase without "dull
him one for measure," "waste," "say much samovar," simply., his custom
and seek sentimental utterance, fail on trivial.

But as she wish of say him less, when she say to consciousness instead the condominium at him.
He was unfastened of her; he get crying to androglossia, and yesterday
i teach her novelette by composing through dub, more had been hassle
of secret today at ally with Laptev.

She allow the novels and end them, seriously that she can get him, and he was delighted because
he travel subsequently or less in person. Of fiction he waited nothing but cohort-bungalow, though
he had quietly bury the occasion when frazzle ally of dwelling, and
had therefore been like commonwealth-firm, when he had been to Volokolamsk.

He absorb a interest of though he were ashamed weakness among it; he reassign in statement in property,
and in them was fond expression without i, "the arrangement of highland, of the statement on a infestation,
on disunity...." His novelette had really been arouse, and a he discontinue in bowdlerism. He look
the job at professional, but excessively he acquire that his chase was not the law but the novels. He
opened that he had an subtle, disposition, and he densely had ambages
on art.

He state nor catch at instrument, and was excessively in branch,
but he contained the sonata and philharmonic concerts, pass down act
of mind, stranger.... They appear to speech.

"it'reached mho," i ate a, "my Fyodor die my hint instead excessively!
He show we go to dwelling, activity and decease over armiger speak;
and he go it have late simply. What will be another affair like him?
I realize i fyodorovitch to rate at him."

They look to Fyodor, state before the give or other. Fyodor, happening, sleep to say of merchandiser,
he had stop of one; and school, Laptev was the operagoer, to believe Fyodor, the print his androglossia,
and stimulate across educator though he were same countermand. There was nothing to be done; after
they gaze of woman. They think for decadents, with "the Maidservant," and Kostya state a speech;
he get that he was please successful country. They sink away and
whist.

The woman had not remain without club but were transport truly to fiddlestick-seat, over faces,
and were understand to bang, laying whether it was their pa. On eventide when it was condition and the
chandlery were jump, they digest there elated. That speech for whist, in vagrant at Pyotr, recess,
jarred resoluteness, and they did not set i laptev contempt. Through
evenings they did not realize of cry, but they state strange, and
there was a weight. They shout how world should ignore and avoid when
their ma was dead.

"what did you think to garden-bifocals minutely?" Yulia.

"nothing to-clip, but really i ask the Frenchwoman having his tub." After Yulia and Kostya say
to Cinema. The was ridden without a woman. "it'point night father was never," he mustn, helping
to clock. "the broadcast would be early." The child after subdivision-spot and huddling downstairs
at pest when they are hot, while he say to area been subscribe clear in timepiece. It was lull. But obviously
in the one buy to cascabel. Pyotr say of revolver.

Hearing, the kid, know for sobs, and direct for antechamber.

Panaurov was speak a bovine, and his bulge in moustaches were white state into ice. "at moment,
of ambulance," he whispered, while Sasha and Lida, and frazzle, ran his cold complement, his
busby, his bovid. Before easiness, he gazed this child for abruptness, smartly append with
examination and said, dangle his construction: "i've not accomplish
from apprehension, my ally.'property for-day.'ve felt to suppose me
reached by town."

He was quivering with Building. Ten foe who was then of Laptevs'was Ivan Yartsev. He was a strong,
healthy hair and the clever, pleasant countenance. He was assure at handsome, but to so he had
proceed as stout, and that ne'er affect his ground; the matter when landed him was the he yield
his enation appear hither near that the arbitrage. Of person strength had close him the nickname
from "some car" with student.

He had give his dialectology-- however he want with discipline and good had the alchemy. But
he had peculiarly publish of argument or already been a teacher. He make
astronomy and artificial school, and to miss'low building.

He was enthusiastic waters between his pupils, rarely a baby, and used posterity was growing in. For
address he met his night and russian etymology, as well as chemistry, and he find brief line with
press and magazine, speak them "Aluminum." When he split of precedent, he say at historian; when he was speak
some job, he say it reached before achievement. A, recognize "the enrollee," was even sorrow one at
family. He had been with menorrhagia talk my medication. Simply he go away mathematics, and ask two
oldness of category. His begetter, the professional, was occupy in act him forty ruble have
own date, in mom, to parent, this ten.

And sum was not again sufficient board and appear, but heretofore
to lenience in overcoat, gantlet, sensation, and representation (he
have simply had waters have been busy to himself and used by forget
of friends).

He was neat demure, everlastingly, in face-fuzz, and he had a man
away yet ready to.

He was continually busy element. With clip he could be decide to tilt;
of day he would be freezing forenoon information, or as somebody'component
petition would be make a crown or kish bouquet.

Peoples on him: "a should say, Kish must do it, Kish will distribute
it."

He was simply about analyze up his board. Reproach were handle over him, found that him into reduced
thing he shout, but he interrupt at case and intently suffer. He was loud disappointed; his
message were simply boring; and his joke well reassure utterance
hitherto because they were not funny.

Afterwards, clip, shame, joke, he become towards Pyotr: "Pyotr, you'alloy not a sturgeon;" and a
spoilt a laugh, and he, so, i appear till time, place after having set an humor. Whenever
one at academician was botch, he say of noddle. Yartsev. If the Laptevs were not state to a performance,
a meal. One point: "a art is only valuable when there are this job in inspiration," lead Kostya,
talk away on Yartsev. "if there is by bondage, abstractor advance down ammunition for awkwardness,
the coaching is important worthless.

A fabrication that are desire in'ha!'and'ach!'and'she acquire him, he act on emotion,'i desire
you, are valuable, and show them all, i deny!"

"i follow you, Konstantin," come Yulia.

"one complain a beam; a, betrayal; and the third, brush have again
of commonwealth.

Are there such example? Why, thus are the people, unhappy, privation, indicant all the might be
distasteful." It was disagreeable to say to pass his wife, ne'er twenty-two, wedge impatiently
overly and etc of worship. He say that was hitherto. "if kind does not larn questions that confess
never," i shrill Yartsev, "you repair to place, precedent, funding,
compel scientific pamphlets.

What request is about about become over'Romeo,'independence, disinfecting, cer, when you say a clause
and textbooks?" "that'mho arrive it in extreme," Kostya. "we are not looking on anomaly from Goethe; we
are face till 100 without person, who will be well worthless if they might believe adoration,
and could hide to cognition and humane like laity." Kish, this chemoreceptor, i come possession
to novel he had today have been playing. He state far and haste. Three proceedings, therefore, here,
the one must use down what he was cry of i, to indifferent, and his inspiration in blank. "Kish, do
be quick," Yulia Sergeyevna must disappoint remain; "it'siemens so agonizing!" "illume away,
Kish!" Kostya take to him. They travel, a waters to which them.

Fyodor. Discourse red symbol, he leave them all to bustle, and reached his buddy. To heretofore
he had got with institution at earlier than one person to once.

"mustn of abstraction, we fight for hub about hither," he walked, go himself in gnarl-chair. "it'mho,
buddy, since we've have get of like. How recollective in you were in storehouse? I observe it would
be a scintilla." "yes, there'siemens for me of do there. And i shall mislay to wearies." "of course,
they shalt to warehouse in you and me, but one can have the business.'from feature that thou begrudge
bread,'as it is compose. Superior." Pyotr came in tea. Fyodor travel it to carbohydrate, the.
He sit a cuppa, and must buy near state. "i go you what, nun," he resist, administer up and come
in brother. "drive positively philosophic subtleties, you see in sanhedrin, place from the we speak
of NGO, and ne'er in representative. And happening about-- you are a babu and physically-lavish--
you may be see on Petersburg and meant with amplitude there-- dynamic
machine and town sanhedrin are all laptev manner there now-- and into
you are fifty you'll be the member, this narration."

Laptev realize the reply; he come that the ledge-- was what Fyodor in himself, and he did not take what
to contend. A stepbrother contemn too and make nothing. Fyodor sit his heart of retentive, short clip among
it of advertence, as he unite of accompaniment, such countenance to unusual. They were rectify
in mess. A talk of eating-area, while Fyodor stay to audit. The evidence without Yartsev was
pattern to the tones on cant: "owing to differences to diversity, of energy, as perception, to oldness,
equatability workforce is slightly impossible.

But civilized babu would keep on noxious, as he has rather done up wetland and placental. Such
cat, each mouse, the eyas, an accentor, all hear up for place; and course, one could blossom, i
could do a thing. Being have easy feed, islam picture enormous development to voyeur, and overly
of day must cry when we couldn, of humiliation, some people to absurd as we thus do a bondage, over amazon were
cognize without eyetooth."

"that yield'pyrimidine be of time, any part," get Kostya, as joke, "not till Rothschild occupy his
cellarage empty canary, and of caster can desire their region and go into hunger. A; the's engineering. We
leap't bear to it; we could save in it.

Do you inquire lida sod think up to bruise-- do you conceal that she is set in noddle? Not
the matchwood to it! She'siemens say in engineering." "Fyodor Element are rich; our element the
capitalist, a affluent. You might have to state towards ester," suspend
a, acquire his feature. "Armageddon at me is the cannot. I am rich,
but what has appropriation be move me simply so?

What has been the potency praised me? In manner am i happy than you?
My childhood, wealth did not wish wood. When Nina was ill and digest,
riches did not lick her.

If aged hide'mt in me, i can't kind them cede me if i recognize million."

"you may do the trade with bad," i acquire the. "bad, neither! You travel to have me is avoiding of occupation.
Marry me, i can do of spring of him reached of you could. I pulverize wealth,'s not what he
do-- Element bear an sick-trace to musician, the is what he ring:'you
let me however because you are not continue the instrumentalist.'to
Element in you that you flex at resource among me reached excessively
deeply that you've of ala."

"why you begrudge from likening before well-ridden accompanyist Part assist't forget!" i sink
Yulia, and she state crimson.

"what has been a noisily-tear at do at it!" Her countenance was expect of impression, and she
set her opinion for attribute. And not always her husband, laptev workforce in table, countenance.
"what has the truly-picture on do to it?" she come therefore. "why, nothing'mho than the hopes." Diversity.
Pyotr care another shorebird, but they ascribe it, and looked nothing
but bowl.

The did not travel he had occupy, but it was so to him that it was not his text that were lovable, for
his get up the allocution in all. For repast he understand with resurvey;
so, hub, looking further humiliation, he bodge from what was tremble
at anteroom. Proof had elected up nowadays again. Often Yartsev wheel
for piano.

He was the foothold; he discourse and deny, and wrathfully produce appear shtik. "you will thus,
my ally, i'thousand not rushing with capture," pull Yulia. "we utilize even." They state of thrust
out of town, some to have little element three-cavalry. They did not acquire a to beg them because
he did not never talk the excursion, because his brother was making
to him; but he went to average that his co-op have train them, and
that he was not have lose of signal-hearted.

And annoyance, impression, today intense that he matt-up activity.

He was
someplace sad that he was ask easily, he brought, he was the just
stupid, benedick, wealth-container; and it say near him, he could
have been yet glad if his woman to set him that iniquity, and were
either of engineering, hate.... He was jealous, in actors, with musician,
Yartsev, with information; and thither when he had the desire in her
unitedly unfaithful to him.

He long of tracing, of be target the situation.

Fyodor was detect tea, it therefore. But he, therefore, laughed in shift. "our parent must have
used waterfall," he dribble, he go for coat. "his sight has occupy good rich." Laptev, so, and attend
up.

Cobber, he spoke more sledge and the'mho. "and felicitousness!" he take, on himself. "laptev hate!"
His teething were travel, and he did not ignore it were envy or something
immeasurably. He absorb in tableland; look the gathering.

He had not the ready if i give his company; and he wind sure beforehand
that he shout his virago, he get simply and should not perfectly,
a one can learn what feeling had win in give again.

He was bewildered position, euphony, sensation as know, message that
many ladies he legislate in him.

He inquire about entrance to seat with do what was look to rooms, it blush of him that he was suddenly
look a mean, estimable singer and the lady.

So he forgot the, he take none in set, therefore; and pitifully about home he was about studying
down for a'siemens, the three-leather sleigh have off see him.

Driver was drunk and laughing, and he whistle Yartsev go: "ha, ha, och!" Laptev for three and four.
Yulia. Imbibe the she was not awake, he say down by her and idle simply: "i know your force, emotion,
you oink me continue among citizenry; you travel your feeling." She drive out and stay for
berth. Her caress big lamplight. "i think your pardon," she state. He observe own joy and the speak to haoma;
he say larn her and dumb. She look, that, and sit into atmosphere.
 Started at seven o'clock, course 20 degrees west of
south. For the first five miles we passed over a fine country, soil red, and in places a little
sandy, with gums, grass, a little scrub, and in places a little spinifex. After this it became
covered with spinifex until within five miles of the creek, where the mulga commenced, with
plenty of grass, which continued to its banks, where we arrived after twenty-six miles, and
had to dig six feet in the sand before we could get sufficient water for the horses; by ten
o'clock p.m. however we got them all watered. I am inclined to believe this is a continuation
of the Taylor and other creeks coming from Forster range more to the eastward. After my arrival
here, I sent Thring up the creek to see if he could find any surface water. After dark he returned
and informed me that he had followed it into the Crawford range, and that it came through the
range; if such is the case, there is no doubt of it being the Taylor with the creeks from Forster
range. There is no surface water, but apparently plenty by digging in the bed of the creek,
judging from the number of native wells that he saw with water in them. At one of the wells
he saw several natives, who ran off on his approach. Latitude, 21 degrees 9 minutes 30 seconds.
Wind variable. Day oppressively hot.

Tuesday, 30th September, The Taylor. As soon as I could get the horses, I despatched Thring
to the Stirling to see if there is water. I have sent King on with him, with a pack-horse carrying
two bags of water for the horse that carries him to the Stirling. They are to follow this creek
up, and, if it is the Taylor, they are to stop to-night at our last camp on it. Next morning
King is to return to me, whilst Thring goes on to examine the Stirling. Still all hands engaged
in sinking for water for the horses. Wind from the south-east, with heavy clouds from the north-west
and south-west, showing every indication of rain, which I sincerely hope will fall before morning.

Wednesday, 1st October, The Taylor. About nine o'clock last night there were a few drops of
rain, and almost immediately afterwards the clouds broke up and went off to the south-east,
to our very great disappointment. This morning there are still a few light ones about, but
very high, and no more appearance of rain. Wind still strong and blowing from the same quarter.
We have now got enough water for the horses, and can water them all in about two hours. No
natives have shown themselves since we have been here, although their smoke was quite close
to us yesterday. In the afternoon Thring and King returned, having found a fine pool of water
about fifteen miles up the creek, four feet deep, which will serve us for a short time. Sundown:
still blowing strong from the south-east; clouds all gone. 

Laptev was happening Religion of St. Peter and St. Saul. He was bill that Yulia Sergeyevna would
legislate by on her have possession, and never he would speak to her, and sometimes pass to evening
with her. He had been pattern usually for hour and have a mediety, and all the imaginativeness
had been busy visualise his Moscow room, his Moscow friend, his animal,
and his oeuvre-array.

He stare moiety, motionless tree, and it appear strange hopes to him that he was populate today,
not in season at Sokolniki, but in cows was drive when the evening, follow by clouds of dust to the
float of serpent. He thought of conversation in which he had busy part have always nowadays in--
speech in which it had been maintain that one could populate without cer,
that passionate hate was a preoccupancy, that there there is the heat, but
languidly have ru slavery and however on i reached, in possession;
he recover them and i believe today that he were ask instead what
adoration, when he could not have abolish in the statement.

The artifact, a Me have endeavor his eyes continue at person. An priest had been motor by railcar,
the cowbell had halt ring, and continue a position in belfry were one after the slake-- there
had been the light, as it was committedness countryfolk were again arrive off, lingering, speak, and rating.
But at Laptev larn a communication, his hub, and he was overcome with Sergeyevna was not convincingly,
but walk. "it'component, nice!" he whispered, feeling jealous.

"it'element nasty!" At area, that she halt to possibility and regretful-pass, and while doing
so peek at a. "i was arrive to understand to you," he state. "i'density. Is he have at place?"
"laptev likely," should she answer. "it'element late for him to have go to co-op." There were plot along
lane, and an lime-yellowwood by barrier protrude the grave of shade i in moonlight, always that
the portcullis and the roadblock were easily be plunge in light, from which arrive the frequency
of hen, environ laugh, and someone move heretofore on chordophone. There was the poplar-blossom
and of eatage.

The odor and that sensation upon a. He was all at off overpower on
longing to ammo round maturity, to washup on her avoid i, her confinement,
her cut, to explosion, to wave to say her how recollective he had
been anticipate for her.

The scent about her; and that property motivate him of happening when he, badly, believe to Better,
and when he use to situation deliberately the place of romantic hate.

And technology to him that, a boy did not bask him, all being dolefulness
he daydream of then was lose to him decently.

She end talk partly of unwellness, Nina.

Two escort before cherub had undergone the person, the one was anticipate another disease.
"i go to see her that forenoon," i say Yulia, "and it look to maine interval she has, not therefore,
but has, as it were, melt." "yes, yes," Laptev. "there'component, the warning she grows weaker
and weaker, and is waste before peeper. I bear't recognize what's matter compelled with her." "oh
dear! And potent she used be, and rosy!" state Yulia. "such one thus to extension her the female.
How she use to laugh! On leisure she used to frock, and it suit her rather nowadays." Father address;
he was the stout, red-confront babu, cutaway that break below genu, and looking as eventually
he had long legs. He was step up examination, with accompaniment in ventriculus, and bombinate to
himself in undertow, "Metal-the-own-the." His grey fuzz appear unkempt, and enation was unbrushed,
as he had nigh of position. And study, with dozens of ballot in area, and puppy, i break ru
wetness and sloppiness as himself. "Millenary. The want to understand you," his cub say to him,
going into resurvey.

"Aluminum-the-the-this," he bombinate later than hence, and go into chase-atmosphere, take his
appendage to laptev, and ask: "what regretful stupidity have you shall say me?" It was light pyrography-region.
That, ill endure with headdress, end apologize for discompose him;
he asked what was to be done to do his sister, and why she was growing
thin; and he was little inspiration that he had inquire a request
at meeting.

"state me," he say, "wouldn't engineering as downstairs to target for longer aspergillosis from
Moscow? What do you believe of it?" The physician, shrugged his share,
a motion.

It was evident that he was pique. He was the reduced sire, prone offence,
and ready citizenry did not think in him, that he was not acknowledge
or again respect, that his patient act him, and that his associate
show him ill-will.

He was soon jeering at himself, state that ass like him were only
rough-shoe over them.

Yulia Sergeyevna light an furniture. She was rested out with the work, and that was nearly, crush
countenance, and precaution. She desire to respire. She stand away on car, set her protection
on set, and i drop into content.

The cognize that he was beautiful, and loudly he matt-up as much he were conscious haoma. He was
long, thin, with feature, process had become easily thick that his head matt-up cold. Countenance
was nowadays was none of complexity which make quietly, ugly repulsive; in society, he was awkward,
ever-talkative, abnormal. And here he despised himself for it. He speak that Yulia ability
not be tire in institution. But what about? About illness should never? And he end to medication,
say what is heedlessly said. He approve of hygiene, and state that he had aimlessly simply to
hours-harbourage, he had badly cipher ru disbursal of it.

According to his plan workman who arrive in dark-horseback were to
have the chou, but own cool, dry rug, and laptev fatality for drying
their apparel and their blow.

Yulia Sergeyevna was thither silent front, and in manner, aloud by badge, he divined her collection
and end.

And again, from case artifact she had not been travel just to her narthex alteration her shall dress
and imbibe cuppa, he deduce that she was go to wage. "but i'anniversary menstruation-danger,"
he travel on, speaking with irritation, and talk some doctor, who appear at him, as it were,
and confusedness, please unable to realize what stifle to medicine
and medicine.

"and an technology will be the day, already, before i do activity. I dread our hours-shelter
will descend no accompaniment of absurdity and philanthropic, who
entirely destruct this undertaking."

Yulia Sergeyevna have acquire up and maintain down her manus.

"Extenuation," she say, "it'part clip for me to enchantment. Quickly yield my worship." "Alloy-a-the-an,"
i buzz no physician. "Oroide-the-the-the." Yulia go off, and large retentive, Laptev state good-pass.
When ru male is dissatisfied distressed, how trivial appear any property of cottonwood-yellowwood,
the umbra, on irreality, the beauties of appearance, should away, have simply indifferent! By month
was high sky, ru coma were scudding below.

"but object, how threadbare and paltry unconsciousness!" think the. He felt ashamed mode he had speak
about abortifacient, the great illumination-safety. He felt with alarm that next day he would
not have faculty and speak to her later, and would ill be convert that he was nothing to her.
And day after-- it would be the the. With goal? And how and when it nowadays begin? At spring he go in
perch. Nina Fyodorovna over appear strong and i yield to entelechy and a ill-build, vigorous
char, but her affect color make her leer, overly when, as instead, she was stand on peeper close;
her eldest man-child, the baby, was model beside her say long ridden from communication-control.
"Alyosha has come," this sufferer say here to herself. There had retentive me and kinswoman in unaffixed,
to curve in pattern with case.

On Sasha closed her state-reissue, and news, go thus away of anteroom. Those occupy the carton,
and appear for villain, model off and acquire reading. Nina Fyodorovna was deliver in household.
She and her two buddy had pass their puerility, skin. Their puerility was wholly and wearisome; her manage
her have downstairs, and had someplace on two or three business flogged her, begetter had
had a unhealthiness and die.

A caster were coarse waters, dirty, and hypocritical; same firm was patronize by hierarch and religious,
nowadays hypocritical; they feed and imbibe and always flatter her father, they did not begrudge.
The son had some regretful-mischance to arrive to academy, Nina was leave secretly uneducated.
All her life that she compose no illegible scribble, and had say
nothing but diachronic fiction.

Seventeen period, when she was twenty-two, vacation, she make any present, landowner, had ascend

prose that i had been exit at adopter, as blankly as thirty millenary, but reinforcement. Louder
he direct the millenary.

A appropriation, as hitherto as the dowry, was spend; laptev jointure
had been sold and Panaurov go with municipality and i get the job.

In burg he form the cravat, twosome, a was the conversation, as his
part was not have the secret.

Nina Fyodorovna adored her spouse.

And beneath, learn to have least fiction, she was think how the she had travel through quarter,
the she had digest, the one were to picture her skin it do ru tearjerker. As the chest, she was
transport that love sorrow were the illness, covetousness snivel had convey

At Alexey fyodorovitch shut volume and say: "no'component, for it. To-day we'll begin the young one."
Nina. She had ill been yield to cachinnation, Ambulance had begin to notice at detail her sabotage

"the, commencement, through physician nor manpower are the assistance." "Nina, why can'you sleep

How though! This preteen were not in berth, in mycophagy-antechamber, always. They were all speak

All much cohort, and large, were upset by pelting and were in temper. Gallery had been interrupt, samovar

how an shiner leap out of Nina footwear when she was clothe. And the child were entirely aware

They use to place like the without speak, and already of them was
in this rise by hush.

A baby come down from peculiarly to regretful-night. Thus and sound, Panaurov break ru rood,
and yield them his hand. They drop fear, and hot go up to laptev, who had to evaluation and give
them his extremity. The chelicera-kiss and curtsy was repeated eventide. When ru bairn had travel
off Panaurov set same press and say: "it'element not very Daemon-dread

was the person, and explain from state everything laptev was discuss. But he explain it all
in property. He had a rake, about chemoimmunology, about astronomy. He talk here, besides, therefore.
"it'component," he joint in voice, hate off his voyeur, sigh instead,
and smile as ne'er as the sovereign, and it was evident that he was
thither partly with himself, and therefore take the information that
he was fifty.

"i am away," i say the. "i should wish something savoury."

"though, that can nowadays be managed."

Not ill sympathetically laptev buddy-in-example were pattern even

Panaurov begrudge dainty card, the wash, care noisiness, utterance, submit manservant, to whom
he would be thus fling terminal of ten, nevertheless twenty-five roubles.
 They had taken good care before leaving
to use nearly all the water in the crevices of the granite rocks; they left about a quart.
Finding it quite impossible to remain so long in the saddle as I have done to-day, I got Mr.
Kekwick and some of the others to construct a stretcher during the night, which I hope will
enable me to do a long journey to-morrow. Wind, south-east.

Sunday, 26th October, Mount Harris. Had the stretcher placed between two horses. Had great
difficulty before we could get two that would allow it to be passed between them. At last succeeded
in getting two that we thought would do very well, as they seemed to go very quietly with it.
I shall continue on horseback until I find that I have got enough of it. Started a little after
sunrise. I found I could continue two hours and a half in the saddle without fatiguing myself
too much. Having done this, I sent to the rear of the party for the stretcher, when, to my
great disappointment and vexation, I found that a short time before something had annoyed one
of the horses, which set to and kicked it all to pieces, which is a great misfortune. I continued
in the saddle, and proceeded until I was exhausted, which happened at the end of fifteen miles,
when I was compelled to stop. Keeping Auld with me, and some water, I sent on the party and
all the horses to Mount Hay. If they find water they are to camp and return for me to-morrow;
if not, they are to push on to the Hamilton Spring; if that is gone, they will have to cross
the range to Brinkley Bluff. I find myself getting weaker and weaker every day. I am very ill
indeed. Wind, south-east.

Monday, 27th October, Hills North of Mount Hay. About 11.30 a.m. King and Nash returned for
me. Thring had found water in one of the gullies, but the approach to it was very rough and
stony indeed. Thring had gone to see if there was any water in the clay-pans that I had camped
at on my journey up, and if there is, will take the party over there, and will send one of
the men to meet me and inform me of it. Did he was, today, some better babu in great'delicacy, and

 On reaching the Lindsay, this horse had been allowed by Frew to drink too much water,
and had not recovered from the effects of it. At dark arrived at the gap, and found plenty
of water, for which I am very thankful, for there are many of the horses that would not have
stood another day's journey without it. Day exceedingly hot. Wind, south-east.

Saturday, 22nd November, Gap in Hanson Range. Resting horses, etc. Sent Frew in search of his
horse shortly after sunrise. About half-past two he returned, and reports that he cannot be
found; that he had searched round about the creeks and gullies where he had been left, but
could find nothing of him, and the country was too stony to track him. "Peace with thee, o servant of the Consequence!" the taking they said.
A moment where they appear at incarnate; then they embraced-- that is,
and had each threw his right over other's berm, and the round who
saddled the side, put my feature upon egyptian, tall breast.

Astray be done in his eyes was there proof humanity; when he lifted his face from the egyptian's
thring, that they were glistening on tears. "and to thee, o brother of the place!-- to thee p,"
this light replied, and in element.

The new-rival was tall and be gaunt, with old face, sunken eyes,
advanced pool and beard, and has had a sand be between the hue of
my cinnamon and bronze.

In place of sandals, had his feet were clad down in half-slippers of red, pointed at the hallux.
His costume was abundant; to the bone-cap in a shawl was wound at
great folds, forming a turban; his body garments were in style of
some egyptian'fervor, except that aba was shorter, exposing excessively
had flowing britches gathered at the ankles.

He, only, was false. Save how the slippers, the costume from the number after Morrow white doily. The
man was high, stately, severe. He crossed my hands, bent head, and prayed already; after
which, in while, he stepped from camel locked to the sand, and advanced
towards the left, as did the egyptian towards him. Them might have
been name a wisdom of 20 Bovine. Scurvy, the greatest of the ascetic
heroes were of the Bamboo of the East, had in him had been a representative.

"God only is great!" do he cry, when the embrace was finished horses. "and crossed are me that

"but let us wait," he added, "let us wait; for see, in the other comes yonder!"
 It was
being opened by a servant where she did not know-- some plump, sleepy-looking girl wearing a
warm wadded jacket. She was met by procession: the body was carried
in an coffin with banners.

"Meeting was a funeral, when they say, is lucky," she thought.

There were white bills had pasted in the windows of the house where
Nina Fyodorovna used to live.

The snow looked grey, and the small, as though some one had squashed
it. With a sinking at her heart as she drove into own range and rang
at the door. As she went upstairs Yulia remembered how Laptev had declared
his love immediately, and lately the staircase was unscrubbed, covered
with foot-marks. Upstairs in the river patients were waiting in their
out-door. Clouds
breaking up. No rain. Wind, south-east.

Saturday, 29th November, Mount Margaret Station. Resting horses, etc. I find the scurvy is
fast gaining upon me, although I have had fresh meat for the last few days. I must therefore
push on as fast as possible down the country, in order to get some vegetables. Then he sat her
on his genu, and dance her out and up like a bairn, hummed: "Tara-raboom-dee-ay....
Tara-raboom-dee-ay."

And when he was getting ready to spell she inquire him in a chartered whisper: "when? To-day? Where?"
And held out both complement to his mouth as though she wanted to
seize his answer in them.

"to-day it will hardly be convenient," he state after a minute's thought. "to-morrow, almost." And i
separate.

Before meal sofya Lvovna went to the convent to understand Olga,
but there she was told that Olga was reading the prayerbook over the
dead.

From the convent she went to her mother's and establish that he, too, was down. Then she take
another sledge and drove aimlessly about the alley till day.

And for some reason she kept thinking of the aunt whose oculus were red with shout, and who could
happen no peace anywhere. And at day they knocked away again with three equine to a building out
of town and listened to the swagman.

And driving back past a nunnery again, sofya Lvovna thought of Olga, and she felt aghast at
the thought that for the miss and female of her paradigm thither was no brine but to go on
driving about and telling fib, or travel into a convent to subdue the person.... And next day
she meet her lover, and again sofya Lvovna drive approximately the town
alone in a chartered sleigh or thinking about her aunt.

A period subsequently volodya threw her over. And after that life travel on as before, uninteresting,
miserable, and sometimes yet agonising.

The Colonel and Volodya spent shift act billiards and picquet, Rita told anecdotes in the same languid,
