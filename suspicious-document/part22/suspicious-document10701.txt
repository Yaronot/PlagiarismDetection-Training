A Grand piano being carried into Mr Esau Tankardew's!  What next!  What can the old gentleman
want with a grand piano?  Most likely he has taken it for a bad debt--some tenant sold up.
But say what they may, the fact is the same.  And, stranger still, a tuner pays a visit to
put the instrument in tune.  What can it all mean?  Marvellous reports, too, tell of a sudden
domestic revolution.  The dust and cobwebs have had notice to quit, brooms and brushes have
travelled into corners and crevices hitherto unexplored, the piano rests in a parlour which
smiles in the gaiety of a new carpet and new curtains; prints have come to light upon the walls,
chairs and tables have taken heart, and now wear an honest gloss upon their legs and faces;
ornaments, which had hitherto been too dirty to be ornamental, now show themselves in their
real colours.  Outside the house, also, wonderful things have come to pass; the rocking doorstep
is at rest, and its fellow has been adjusted to a proper level; ever-greens have taken the
place of the old never- greens; knocker and door handle are not ashamed to show their native
brass; the missing rails have returned to their duty in the ranks. Suddenly arrive an rolling lessons

It was not their host's fault, nor Mr John Randolph's, who acted as joint entertainer, if their
guests did not make a hearty tea.  The meal concluded, Mr Tankardew requested his young friend
to bring out some of his curiosities.  These greatly interested all the party--especially Mrs
Franklin and Mary, who were delighted with the traveller's liveliness and intelligence.

"Exactly so," replied the other; "I presumed, of course, that he knew when to stop."

"And yet, my dear sir," rejoined the old man, earnestly, "isn't it perilous work offering a
stimulant which is so ruinous to tens of thousands, and has emptied multitudes of homes of
health, and peace, and character?"

"Well, it may be so; I'm certainly beginning to think it anything but wise getting children
into the habit of liking these things;" and he glanced anxiously at Mark, who appeared intensely
absorbed in looking at some photographs upside down.

There was a few moments' pause, and then the old man said, "Come, let us have a little music,
perhaps Miss Rothwell will favour us."

Nothing loth, the young lady led off in a brilliant sonata, displaying in the execution more
strength of muscle than purity of taste; then came a duet by the eldest and youngest sisters,
and then a song by the second.  Mr Tankardew expressed his satisfaction emphatically at the
conclusion, possibly more at finding the performance ended than at the performance itself.
