in the Tuileries, so called from the magnificent festival which Lewis XIV. in 1662, there gave
to the queen and the queen-mother) was already filled; the king had not been in bed; all the
night had probably been spent in combining a plan of defence, if attacked, or rather of retreat;
soon after seven the king, the queen, their two children (the dauphin, seven years old, and
his sister fourteen) Princess Elizabeth, (the queen's sister, about 50 years old) and the Princess
de Lamballe, crossed the garden of the Tuileries, which was still shut, escorted by the National
Guard, and by all the Swiss, and took refuge in the National Assembly, when the Swiss returned
to their posts in the château.

The alarm-bells, which were incessantly ringing, the accounts of the carrying heads upon pikes,
and of the march of almost all Paris in arms; the presence of the king, throwing himself, as
it were, on the mercy of the legislative body; the fierce and determinate looks of the galleries;
all these things together had such an effect on the National Assembly, that it immediately
decreed the suspension of Lewis XVI. which decree was received with universal applause and
clapping.

The quais, the bridges, the gardens, and the immediate scene of battle were covered with bodies,
dead, dying, and drunk; many wounded and drunk died in the night; the streets were filled with
carts, carrying away the dead, with litters taking the wounded to hospitals; with women and

the sans-culottes running about, covered with blood, and carrying, at the end of their bayonets,
rags of the clothes which they had torn from the bodies of the dead Swiss, who were left stark
naked in the gardens.[26]
