During the entire campaign I had been annoyed by guerrilla bands under such partisan chiefs
as Mosby, White, Gilmore, McNeil, and others, and this had considerably depleted my line-of-battle

  As soon as
Custer's retreat was assured, Wharton's division of infantry was sent to Charlottesville to
check Torbert, but this had already been done by Lomax, with the assistance of infantry sent
up from Richmond.  Indeed, from the very beginning of the movement the Confederates had been
closely observing the columns of Torbert and Custer, and in consequence of the knowledge thus
derived, Early had marched Lomax to Gordonsville in anticipation of an attack there, at the
same time sending Rosser down the valley to meet Custer.  Torbert in the performance of his
task captured two pieces of artillery from Johnson's and McCausland's brigades, at Liberty
Mills on the Rapidan River, but in the main the purpose of the raid utterly failed, so by the
27th of December he returned, many, of his men badly frost-bitten from the extreme cold which
had prevailed.

This expedition practically closed all operations for the season, and the cavalry was put into
winter cantonment near Winchester.  The distribution of my infantry to Petersburg and West
Virginia left with me in the beginning of the new year, as already stated, but the one small
division of the Nineteenth Corps.  On account of this diminution of force, it became necessary
for me to keep thoroughly posted in regard to the enemy, and I now realized more than I had
done hitherto how efficient my scouts had become since under the control of Colonel Young;
for not only did they bring me almost every day intelligence from within Early's lines, but
they also operated efficiently against the guerrillas infesting West Virginia.

Harry Gilmore, of Maryland, was the most noted of these since the death of McNeil, and as the
scouts had reported him in Harrisonburg the latter part of January, I directed two of the most
trustworthy to be sent to watch his movements and ascertain his purposes.  In a few days these
spies returned with the intelligence that Gilmore was on his way to Moorefield, the centre
of a very disloyal section in West Virginia, about ninety miles southwest of Winchester, where,
under the guise of a camp-meeting, a gathering was to take place, at which he expected to enlist
a number of men, be joined by a party of about twenty recruits coming from Maryland, and then
begin depredations along the Baltimore and Ohio railroad.  Believing that Gilmore might be
captured, I directed Young to undertake the task, and as a preliminary step he sent to Moorefield
two of his men who early in the war had "refugeed" from that section and enlisted in one of
the Union regiments from West Virginia.  In about a week these men came back and reported that
Gilmore was living at a house between three and four miles from Moorefield, and gave full particulars
as to his coming and going, the number of men he had about there and where they rendezvoused.

With this knowledge at hand I directed Young to take twenty of his best men and leave that
night for Moorefield, dressed in Confederate uniforms, telling him that I would have about
three hundred cavalry follow in his wake when he had got about fifteen miles start, and instructing
him to pass his party off as a body of recruits for Gilmore coming from Maryland and pursued
by the Yankee cavalry.  I knew this would allay suspicion and provide him help on the road;
and, indeed, as Colonel Whittaker, who alone knew the secret, followed after the fleeing "Marylanders,"
he found that their advent had caused so little remark that the trail would have been lost
had he not already known their destination.  Young met with a hearty, welcome wherever he halted
on the way, and as he passed through the town of Moorefield learned with satisfaction that
Gilmore still made his headquarters at the house where the report of the two scouts had located
him a few days before.  Reaching the designated place about 12 o'clock on the night of the
5th of February, Young, under the representation that he had come directly from Maryland and
was being pursued by the Union cavalry, gained immediate access to Gilmore's room.  He found
the bold guerrilla snugly tucked in bed, with two pistols lying on a chair near by.  He was
sleeping so soundly that to arouse him Young had to give him a violent shake.  As he awoke
and asked who was disturbing his slumbers, Young, pointing at him a cocked six-shooter, ordered
him to dress without delay, and in answer to his inquiry, informed him that he was a prisoner
to one of Sheridan's staff.  Meanwhile Gilmore's men had learned of his trouble, but the early
appearance of Colonel Whittaker caused them to disperse; thus the last link between Maryland
and the Confederacy was carried a prisoner to Winchester, whence he was sent to Fort Warren.

The capture of Gilmore caused the disbandment of the party he had organized at the "camp-meeting,"
most of the men he had recruited returning to their homes discouraged, though some few joined
the bands of Woodson and young Jesse McNeil, which, led by the latter, dashed into Cumberland,
Maryland, at 3 O'clock on the morning of the 21st of February and made a reprisal by carrying
off General Crook and General Kelly, and doing their work so silently and quickly that they
escaped without being noticed, and were some distance on their way before the colored watchman
at the hotel where Crook was quartered could compose himself enough to give the alarm.  A troop
of cavalry gave hot chase from Cumberland, striving to intercept the party at Moorefield and
other points, but all efforts were fruitless, the prisoners soon being beyond reach.

Although I had adopted the general rule of employing only soldiers as scouts, there was an
occasional exception to it.  I cannot say that these exceptions proved wholly that an ironclad
observance of the rule would have been best, but I am sure of it in one instance.  A man named
Lomas, who claimed to be a Marylander, offered me his services as a spy, and coming highly
recommended from Mr. Stanton, who had made use of him in that capacity, I employed him.  He
made many pretensions, often appearing over anxious to impart information seemingly intended
to impress me with his importance, and yet was more than ordinarily intelligent, but in spite
of that my confidence in him was by no means unlimited.  I often found what he reported to
me as taking place within the Confederate lines corroborated by Young's men, but generally
there were discrepancies in his tales, which led me to suspect that he was employed by the
enemy as well as by me.  I felt, however, that with good watching he could do me little harm,
and if my suspicions were incorrect he might be very useful, so I held on to him.

Early in February Lomas was very solicitous for me to employ a man who, he said, had been with
Mosby, but on account of some quarrel in the irregular camp had abandoned that leader.  Thinking
that with two of them I might destroy the railroad bridges east of Lynchburg, I concluded,
after the Mosby man had been brought to my headquarters by Lomas about 12 o'clock one night,
to give him employment, at the same time informing Colonel Young that I suspected their fidelity,
however, and that he must test it by shadowing their every movement. When Lomas's companion
entered my room he was completely disguised, but on discarding the various contrivances by
which his identity was concealed he proved to be a rather slender, dark-complexioned, handsome
young man, of easy address and captivating manners.  He gave his name as Renfrew, answered
all my questions satisfactorily, and went into details about Mosby and his men which showed
an intimacy with them at some time.  I explained to the two men the work I had laid out for
them, and stated the sum of money I would give to have it done, but stipulated that in case
of failure there would be no compensation whatever beyond the few dollars necessary for their
expenses.  They readily assented, and it was arranged that they should start the following
night.  Meanwhile Young had selected his men to shadow them, and in two days reported my spies
as being concealed at Strasburg, where they remained, without making the slightest effort to
continue on their mission, and were busy, no doubt, communicating with the enemy, though I
was not able to fasten this on them.  On the 16th of February they returned to Winchester,
and reported their failure, telling so many lies about their hazardous adventure as to remove
all remaining doubt as to their double-dealing.  Unquestionably they were spies from the enemy,
and hence liable to the usual penalties of such service; but it struck me that through them,
I might deceive Early as to the time of opening the spring campaign, I having already received
from General Grant an intimation of what was expected of me.  I therefore retained the men
without even a suggestion of my knowledge of their true character, Young meanwhile keeping
close watch over all their doings.

Toward the last of February General Early had at Staunton two brigades of infantry under Wharton.
All the rest of the infantry except Echol's brigade, which was in southwestern Virginia, had
been sent to Petersburg during the winter, and Fitz. Lee's two brigades of cavalry also.  Rosser's
men were mostly at their homes, where, on account of a lack of subsistence and forage in the
valley, they had been permitted to go, subject to call.  Lomax's cavalry was at Millboro, west
of Staunton, where supplies were obtainable.  It was my aim to get well on the road before
Early could collect these scattered forces, and as many of the officers had been in the habit
of amusing themselves fox-hunting during the latter part of the winter, I decided to use the
hunt as an expedient for stealing a march on the enemy, and had it given out officially that
a grand fox-chase would take place on the 29th of February.  Knowing that Lomas, and Renfrew
would spread the announcement South, they were permitted to see several red foxes that had
been secured, as well as a large pack of hounds which Colonel Young had collected for the sport,
and were then started on a second expedition to burn the bridges.  Of course, they were shadowed
as usual, and two days later, after they had communicated with friends from their hiding-place,
in Newtown, they were arrested.  On the way north to Fort Warren they escaped from their guards
when passing through Baltimore, and I never heard of them again, though I learned that, after
the assassination of, Mr. Lincoln, Secretary Stanton strongly suspected his friend Lomas of
being associated with the conspirators, and it then occurred to me that the good-looking Renfrew
may have been Wilkes Booth, for he certainly bore a strong resemblance to Booth's pictures.

On the 27th of February my cavalry entered upon the campaign which cleared the Shenandoah Valley
of every remnant of organized Confederates.  General Torbert being absent on leave at this
time, I did not recall him, but appointed General Merritt Chief of Cavalry. for Torbert had
disappointed me on two important occasions--in the Luray Valley during the battle of Fisher's
Hill, and on the recent Gordonsville expedition--and I mistrusted his ability to conduct any
operations requiring much self-reliance.  The column was composed of Custer's and Devin's divisions
of cavalry, and two sections of artillery, comprising in all about 10,000 officers and men.
On wheels we had, to accompany this column, eight ambulances, sixteen ammunition wagons, a
pontoon train for eight canvas boats, and a small supply-train, with fifteen days' rations
of coffee, sugar, and salt, it being intended to depend on the country for the meat and bread
ration, the men carrying in their haversacks nearly enough to subsist them till out of the
exhausted valley.

Grant's orders were for me to destroy the Virginia Central railroad and the James River canal,
capture Lynchburg if practicable, and then join General Sherman in North Carolina wherever
he might be found, or return to Winchester, but as to joining Sherman I was to be governed
by the state of affairs after the projected capture of Lynchburg. The weather was cold, the
valley and surrounding mountains being still covered with snow; but this was fast disappearing,
however, under the heavy rain that was coming down as the column moved along up the Valley
pike at a steady gait that took us to Woodstock the first day. ********** in the STYLE.

On finding
myself now the in the street, i noticed that i was reclining in the
gutter, bare-headed.

  There, finding themselves immediately in the
enemy's rear, they promptly formed as foragers and held the east bank of the stream till all
the Confederates surrendered except Rosser, who succeeded in making his way back to the valley,
and Generals Early, Wharton, Long, and Lilley, who, with fifteen or twenty men, escaped across
the Blue Ridge.  I followed up the victory immediately by despatching Capehart through Rock-fish
Gap, with orders to encamp on the east side of the Blue Ridge.  By reason of this move all
the enemy's stores and transportation fell into our hands, while we captured on the field seventeen
battle flags, sixteen hundred officers and men, and eleven pieces of artillery.  This decisive
victory closed hostilities in the Shenandoah Valley.  The prisoners and artillery were sent
back to Winchester next morning, under a guard of 1,500 men, commanded by Colonel J.  H.  Thompson,
of the First New Hampshire.

The night of March 2 Custer camped at Brookfield, Devin remaining at Waynesboro'.  The former
started for Charlottesville the next morning early, followed by Devin with but two brigades,
Gibbs having been left behind to blow up the iron railroad bridge across South River. Because
of the incessant rains and spring thaws the roads were very soft, and the columns cut them
up terribly, the mud being thrown by the sets of fours across the road in ridges as much as
two feet high, making it most difficult to get our wagons along, and distressingly wearing
on the animals toward the middle and rear of the columns. Consequently I concluded to rest
at Charlottesville for a couple of days and recuperate a little, intending at the same time
to destroy, with small parties, the railroad from that point toward Lynchburg. Custer reached
Charlottesville the 3d, in the afternoon, and was met at the outskirts by a deputation of its
citizens, headed by the mayor, who surrendered the town with medieval ceremony, formally handing
over the keys of the public buildings and of the University of Virginia.  But this little scene
did not delay Custer long enough to prevent his capturing, just beyond the village, a small
body of cavalry and three pieces of artillery.  Gibbs's brigade, which was bringing up my mud-impeded
train, did not arrive until the 5th of March.  In the mean time Young's scouts had brought
word that the garrison of Lynchburg was being increased and the fortifications strengthened,
so that its capture would be improbable.  I decided, however, to move toward the place as far
as Amherst Court House, which is sixteen miles short of the town, so Devin, under Merritt's
supervision, marched along the James River, destroying the canal, while Custer pushed ahead
on the railroad and broke it up.  The two columns were to join at New Market, whence I intended
to cross the James River at some point east of Lynchburg, if practicable, so as to make my
way to Appomattox Court House, and destroy the Southside railroad as far east as Farmville.
Owing to its swollen condition the river was unfordable but knowing that there was a covered
bridge at Duguidsville, I hoped to secure it by a dash, and cross there, but the enemy, anticipating
this, had filled the bridge with inflammable material, and just as our troops got within striking
distance it burst into flames.  The bridge at Hardwicksville also having been burned by the
enemy, there was now no means of crossing except by pontoons.  But, unfortunately, I had only
eight of these, and they could not be made to span the swollen river.

Being thus unable to cross until the river should fall, and knowing that it was impracticable
to join General Sherman, and useless to adhere to my alternative instructions to return to
Winchester, I now decided to destroy still more thoroughly the James River canal and the Virginia
Central railroad and then join General Grant in front of Petersburg.  I was master of the whole
country north of the James as far down as Goochland; hence the destruction of these arteries
of supply could be easily compassed, and feeling that the war was nearing its end, I desired
my cavalry to be in at the death.

On March 9 the main column started eastward down the James River, destroying locks, dams, and
boats, having been preceded by Colonel Fitzhugh's brigade of Devin's division in a forced march
to Goochland and Beaver Dam Creek, with orders to destroy everything below Columbia.  I made
Columbia on the 10th, and from there sent a communication to General Grant reporting what had
occurred, informing him of my condition and intention, asking him to send forage and rations
to meet me at the White House, and also a pontoon-bridge to carry me over the Pamunkey, for
in view of the fact that hitherto it had been impracticable to hold Lee in the trenches around
Petersburg, I regarded as too hazardous a march down the south bank of the Pamunkey, where
the enemy, by sending troops out from Richmond, might fall upon my flank and rear.  It was
of the utmost importance that General Grant should receive these despatches without chance
of failure, in order that I might, depend absolutely on securing supplies at the White House;
therefore I sent the message in duplicate, one copy overland direct to City Point by two scouts,
Campbell and Rowan, and the other by Fannin and Moore, who were to go down the James River
in a small boat to Richmond, join the troops in the trenches in front of Petersburg, and, deserting
to the Union lines, deliver their tidings into General Grant's hands.  Each set of messengers
got through, but the copy confided to Campbell and Rowan was first at Grant's headquarters.

I halted for one day at Columbia to let my trains catch up, for it was still raining and the
mud greatly delayed the teams, fatiguing and wearying the mules so much that I believe we should
have been forced to abandon most of the wagons except for the invaluable help given by some
two thousand negroes who had attached themselves to the column: they literally lifted the wagons
out of the mud.  From Columbia Merritt, with Devin's division, marched to Louisa Court House
and destroyed the Virginia Central to Frederick's Hall. Meanwhile Custer was performing similar
work from Frederick's Hall to Beaver Dam Station, and also pursued for a time General Early,
who, it was learned from despatches captured in the telegraph office at Frederick's Hall, was
in the neighborhood with a couple of hundred men.  Custer captured some of these men and two
of Early's staff-officers, but the commander of the Valley District, accompanied by a single
orderly, escaped across the South Anna and next day made his way to Richmond, the last man
of the Confederate army that had so long contended with us in the Shenandoah Valley.

At Frederick's Hall, Young's scouts brought me word from Richmond that General Longstreet was
assembling a force there to prevent my junction with Grant, and that Pickett's division, which
had been sent toward Lynchburg to oppose my march, and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, were moving
east on the Southside railroad, with the object of circumventing me.  Reasoning that Longstreet
could interpose effectually only by getting to the White House ahead of me, I pushed one column
under Custer across the South Anna, by way of Ground Squirrel bridge, to Ashland, where it
united with Merritt, who had meanwhile marched through Hanover Junction.  Our appearance at
Ashland drew the Confederates out in that direction, as was hoped, so, leaving Colonel Pennington's
brigade there to amuse them, the united command retraced its route to Mount Carmel church to
cross the North Anna.  After dark Pennington came away, and all the troops reached the church
by midnight of the 15th.

Resuming the march at an early hour next morning, we took the road by way of King William Court
House to the White House, where, arriving on the 18th, we found, greatly to our relief, the
supplies which I had requested to be sent there.  In the meanwhile the enemy had marched to
Hanover Court House, but being unable either to cross the Pamunkey there or forestall me at
the White House on the south side of the river, he withdrew to Richmond without further effort
to impede my column.

The hardships of this march far exceeded those of any previous campaigns by the cavalry. If you pronounce
any victory "glad-hour" you might present the sidesplitter born to cause merriment amongst persons

Voluntary. Oh, did ye ne'er

  His language was unequivocal and vehement, and when he was through talking,
he conducted me to General Grant's quarters, but he himself did not enter.

General Grant was never impulsive, and always met his officers in an unceremonious way, with
a quiet "How are you" soon putting one at his ease, since the pleasant tone in which he spoke
gave assurance of welcome, although his manner was otherwise impassive.  When the ordinary
greeting was over, he usually waited for his visitor to open the conversation, so on this occasion
I began by giving him the details of my march from Winchester, my reasons for not joining Sherman,
as contemplated in my instructions, and the motives which had influenced me to march to the
White House.  The other provision of my orders on setting out from Winchester--the alternative
return to that place--was not touched upon, for the wisdom of having ignored that was fully
apparent.  Commenting on this recital of my doings, the General referred only to the tortuous
course of my march from Waynesboro' down, our sore trials, and the valuable services of the
scouts who had brought him tidings of me, closing with the remark that it was, rare a department
commander voluntarily deprived himself of independence, and added that I should not suffer
for it.  Then turning to the business for which he had called me to City Point, he outlined
what he expected me to do; saying that I was to cut loose from the Army of the Potomac by passing
its left flank to the southward along the line of the Danville railroad, and after crossing
the Roanoke River, join General Sherman.  While speaking, he handed me a copy of a general
letter of instructions that had been drawn up for the army on the 24th.

When I had gone over the entire letter I showed plainly that I was dissatisfied with it, for,
coupled with what the General had outlined orally, which I supposed was the "other instructions,"
I believed it foreshadowed my junction with General Sherman.  Rawlins thought so too, as his
vigorous language had left no room to doubt, so I immediately began to offer my objections
to the programme. At a distance of four hundred from London, in far unsophisticated society, you
may perhaps venture something against the supplies were of these here-well artist like "famed lightning"

All this was said in a somewhat emphatic manner, and when I had finished he quietly told me
that the portion of my instructions from which I so strongly dissented was intended as a "blind"
to cover any check the army in its general move, to the left might meet with, and prevent that
