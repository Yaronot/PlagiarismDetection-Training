At three o'clock, I climbed a gentle hill,--and I was now very weary and weak,--and from the
summit, looked upon the river James, flowing far off to the right, through woods, and bluffs,
and grainfields, and reedy islands. At last, I had gained the haven. The bright waters below
me seemed to cool my red, fiery eyes, and a sort of blessed blindness fell for a time upon
me, so that, when I looked again my lashes were wet. The prospect was truly beautiful. Far
to the west, standing out from the chalky bluffs, were scattered the white camps of Wise's
Confederate brigade. Beyond, on the remote bank of the river, lay farm-lands, and stately mansions,
and some one showed me, rising faintly in the distance, "Drury's Bluff," the site of Fort Darling,
where the gunboats were repulsed in the middle of May. Below, in the river, lay the Galena,
and a little way astern, the Aroostook. Signal-men, with flags, were elevated upon the masts
of each, and the gunners stood upon the decks, as waiting some emergency. The vessels had steam
up, and seemed to be ready for action at any moment. This was Grand Turkey Bend, and the rising
ground on which I stood, was known as "Malvern Hills." A farm-house lay to my left, and repairing
thither, I cast myself from the nag, and lay down in the shady yard, thankful that I had reached
the haven, and only solicitous now to escape the further privations of McClellan's Peninsular
Campaign.

CHAPTER XIX.

THE HOSPITAL TRANSPORT.

An earnest desire now took possession of me, to be the first of the correspondents to reach
New York. The scenes just transpired had been unparalleled in the war, and if, through me,
the ---- should be the first to make them public, it would greatly redound to my credit. Perhaps
no profession imparts an enthusiasm in any measure kindred to that of the American Newsgatherer.
I was careless of the lost lives and imperilled interests, the suffering, the defeat: no emotions
either of the patriot or the man influenced me. I only thought of the eclat of giving the story
to the world, and nurtured an insane desire to make to Fortress Monroe, by some other than
the common expedient. That this was a paltry ambition I know; but I write what happened, and
to the completion of my sketch of a correspondent, this is necessary to be said. I found Glumley
at the old mansion referred to, and stealthily suggested to him the seizing of an open boat,
whereby we might row down to the Fortress. He rejected it as impracticable, but was willing
to hazard a horseback ride down the Peninsula. I knew that this would not do, and after a short
time I continued my journey down the riverside, hopeful of finding some transport or Despatch
boat. I was now in Charles City County, and the river below me was dotted with woodland islands.
I soon got upon the main road to Harrison's Point or Bar, and followed the stream of ambulances
and supply teams for more than an hour. At last we reached a diverging lane, through which
we passed to a landing, close to a fine dwelling, whose style of architecture I may denominate,
the "Gothic run mad." An old cider-press was falling into rottenness on the lawn; four soldiers
were guarding the well, that the mob might not exhaust its precious contents, and between some
negro-huts and the brink of the bluff, stood a cluster of broad-armed trees, beneath whose
shade the ambulance-drivers were depositing the wounded.

I have made these chapters sufficiently hideous, without venturing to transcribe these new
horrors. Suffice it to say that the men whom I now beheld had been freshly brought from the
fight of New Market, and were suffering the first agonies of their wounds. One hour before,
they had felt all the lustiness of life and adventure. Now, they were whining like babes, and
some had expired in the ambulances. The act of lifting them to the ground so irritated their
wounds that they howled dismally, and yet were so exhausted that after lying upon the ground
awhile, they quietly passed into sleep. Such are the hardening results of war, that some soldiers,
who were unhurt, actually refused to give a trifle of river water from their canteens to their
expiring comrades. At one time a brutal wrangle occurred at the well, and the guard was compelled
to seek reinforcement, or the thirsty people would have massacred them.

I was now momentarily adding to my notes of the battles, and the wounded men very readily gave
me their names; for they were anxious that the account of their misfortunes should reach their
families, and I think also, that some martial vanity lingered, even among those who were shortly
to crumble away. A longboat came in from the Galena, after a time, and General McClellan, who
had ridden down to the pier, was taken aboard. He looked to be very hot and anxious, and while
he remained aboard the vessel, his staff dispersed themselves around the banks and talked over
the issues of the contest. As the General receded from the strand, every sweep of the long
oars was responded to from the hoarse cannon of the battle-field, and when he climbed upon
deck, the steamer moved slowly up the narrow channel, and the signal-man in the foretop flourished
his crossed flag sturdily. Directly, the Galena opened fire from her immense pieces of ordnance,
and the roar was so great that the explosions of field-guns were fairly drowned. She fired
altogether by the direction of the signals, as nothing could be seen of the battle-field from
her decks. I ascertained afterward that she played havoc with our own columns as well as the
enemy's, but she brought hope to the one, and terror to the other. The very name of gunboat
affrighted the Confederates, and they were assured, in this case, that the retreating invaders,
had at length reached a haven. The Galena kept up a steady fire till nightfall, and the Federals,
taking courage, drove their adversaries toward Richmond, at eve. Meanwhile the Commanding General's
escort and body-guard had encamped around us, and during the night the teams and much of the
field cannon fell back. I obtained shelter and meals from Quartermaster Le Duke of Iowa, whose
canvas was pitched a mile or more below, and as I tossed through the watches I heard the splashing
of water in the river beneath, where the tired soldiers were washing away the powder of the battle.

In the morning I retraced to head-quarters, and vainly endeavored to learn something as to
the means of going down the river. Commanders are always anxious to grant correspondents passes
after a victory; but they wish to defer the unwelcome publication of a defeat. I was advised
by Quartermaster-General Van Vliet, however, to proceed to Harrison's Bar, and, as I passed
thither, the last day's encounters--those of "Malvern Hills"--occurred. The scenes along the
way were reiterations of terrors already described,--creaking ambulances, staggering foot soldiers,
profane wagoners, skulking officers and privates, officious Provost guards, defiles, pools
and steeps packed with teams and cannon, wayside houses beset with begging, gossiping, or malicious
soldiers, and wavy fields of wheat and rye thrown open to man and beast. I was amused at one
point, to see some soldiers attack a beehive that they might seize the honey. But the insects
fastened themselves upon some of the marauders, and after indescribable cursing and struggling,
the bright nectar and comb were relinquished by the toilers, and the ravishers gorged upon
sweetness. 

On capital there was in 1 who had the plot chafed. At Fruit but let they stepped myself off this

The country between Alexandria and Warrenton Junction, or, indeed, between Washington and Richmond,
was not unlike those masterly descriptions of Gibbon, detailing the regions overrun by Hyder
Ali. The towns stood like ruins in a vast desert, and one might write musing epitaphs at every
wind-beaten dwelling, whence the wretched denizens had fled in cold and poverty to a doubtful
hospitality in the far South. Fences there were none, nor any living animals save the braying
hybrids which limped across the naked plains to eke out existence upon some secluded patches
of grass. These had been discharged from the army, and they added rather than detracted from
the lonesomeness of the wild. Their great mournful eyes and shaggy heads glared from copses,
and in places where they had lain down beside the track to expire. If we sometimes pity these
dumb beasts as they drag loaded wains, or heavy omnibuses, or sub-soil ploughs, we may also

CHAPTER XXI.

CAMPAIGNING WITH GENERAL POPE.

The court-house village of Fauquier County contained a population of twelve or fifteen hundred
at the commencement of the war. Its people embraced the revolutionary cause at the outstart,
and furnished some companies of foot to the Confederate service, as well as a mounted company
known as the "Black Horse Cavalry." The guns of Bull Run were heard here on the day of battle,
and hundreds of the wounded came into town at nightfall. Thenceforward Warrenton became prominently
identified with the struggle, and the churches and public buildings were transmuted to hospitals.
After the Confederates retired from Manassas Junction, the vicinity of Warrenton was a sort
of neutral ground. At one time the Southern cavalry would ride through the main street, and
next day a body of mounted Federals would pounce upon the town, the inhabitants, meanwhile,
being apprehensive of a sabre combat in the heart of the place. To grace, White met, cannon,
if i scrub them all, but anything, alas, me; from they crush i fell up bayoneting as you would

Gawayne matt-up the agitation, but leave he take i state his message and he ran himself into timber,
and i inquire by hoof.
 They refused
to walk under Federal flags, and stopped their ears when the bands played national music; but
every evening they walked through the main street, arm in arm with dashing Lieutenants and
Captains. Many flirtations ensued, and a great deal of gossip was elicited. In the end, some
of the misses fell out among themselves, and hated each other more than the common enemy. I
overheard a young lady talking in a low tone one evening, to a Captain in the Ninth New York
regiment.

"If you knew my brother," she said, "I am sure you would not fire upon him."

As there were plain, square, prim porches to all the dwellings, the ladies commonly took positions
therein of evenings, and a grand promenade commenced of all the young Federals in the town.
The streets were pleasantly shaded, and a leafy coolness pervaded the days, though sometimes,
of afternoons, the still heat was almost stifling. A jaunt after supper often took me far into
the country, and the starlights were softer than one's peaceful thoughts. To be a civilian
was a distinguished honor now, and I enjoyed the staring of the citizens, who pondered as to
my purposes and pursuits, as only villagers can do. There is a quiet pleasure in being a strange
person in a country town, and so far from objecting to the inquisitiveness of the folk, I rather
like it. One may be passing for a young duke, or tourist, or clergyman, or what not?

The Ninth New York (militia) regiment guarded Warrenton, and it was composed of clever, polite
young fellows, who had taken to volunteering before there was any promise of war, and who turned
out, pluckily, when the strife began. Perhaps public sentiment or pride of organization influenced
them. They were all good-looking and tidy, and their dress-parades, held in the main street,
were handsome affairs. I have never seen better disciplined columns, and the youthful faces
of the soldiers, with the staid locality of the exhibition,--young women, negroes, dogs and
babies, and old men looking on,--seemed to contradict the bloody mission of the troops. The
old men, referred to, were villagers of such long standing that had the Court of Saint James,
or the Vatican, or the battle of Waterloo been moved into their country, they would have still
been villagers to the last. They met beside the Warrenton Inn, under the shade of the trees,
at eleven o'clock every morning, and borrowed the New York papers of the latest date. One individual,
slightly bald, would read aloud, and the rest crouched or stood about him, making grunts and
remarks at intervals. They did not wish to believe the Federal reports, but they must needs
read, and as most of them had sons in the other army, their pulses were constantly tremulous
with anxiety. I think that Pope's resolve to transport these harmless old people beyond his
lines was very barbarous, and the soldiers denounced it in similar terms. They spoke of Pope,
as of some terrible despot, and wished to know when he was coming to town, as they had appointed
a committee, and drafted a petition, asking his forbearance and charity. When these villagers
found me out to be a Newspaper Correspondent, they regarded me with amusing interest, and marvelled
what I would say of their town. A villager is very sensitive as to his place of residence,
and these good people read the----daily, confounding me with all the paper,--editorial, correspondence,
and, I verily believe, advertisements. One of them wished me to board at his residence, and
I was, after a time, invited out to dinner and tea frequently.

The negroes remained in Warrenton, in great numbers, and held carnival of evenings when the
bands played. "Contrabands" were coming daily into town, and idleness and vice soon characterized
the mass of them. They were ignorant, degraded, animal beings, and many of them loved rum;
it was the last link that bound them to human kind. Servants could be hired for four dollars
a month and "keep;" but they were "shiftless" and unprofitable. The Provost-Marshal of the
place was a Captain Hendrickson. His quarters were in the Court House building, and he kept
a zealous eye upon sutlers and citizens. The former trespassed in the sales of liquors to soldiers,
and the latter were accused of maintaining a contraband mail, and of conspiring to commit divers
offences. There were a number of churches in the village, all of which served as hospitals,
and in the quiet cemetery west of the town, two hundred slain soldiers were interred. A stake
of white pine was driven at the head of each grave. Here lay some of the men who had helped
to change the destinies of a continent. No public worship was held in the place. The Sundays
were busy as other days: trains came and went, teams made dust in the streets, cavalry passed
through the village, music arose from all the outlying camps; parades and inspections were
made, and all the preparations for killing men were relentlessly forwarded. A pleasant entertainment
occurred one evening, when a plot of ground adjoining the Warrenton Inn, was appropriated for
a camp theatre. Candle footlights were arranged, and the stage was canopied with national flags.
The citizens congregated, and the performers deferred to their prejudices by singing no Federal
songs. Tho negroes climbed the trees to listen, and their gratified guffaws made the night
quiver. The war lost half its bitterness at such times; but I thought with a shudder of Stuart's
thundering horsemen, charging into the village, and closing the night's mimicry with a horrible
tragedy.

Some of the dwellings about the place were elegant and spacious, but many of these were closed
and the owners removed. Two newspapers had been published here of old, and while ransacking
the office of one of them, I discovered that the type had been buried under the floor. The
planks were speedily torn away, and the cases dragged to light. I obtained some curious relics,
in the shape of "cuts" of recruiting officers, runaway negroes, etc., as well as a column of
a leader, in type, describing the first battle of Bull Run. For two weeks I had little to do,
as the campaign had not yet fairly commenced, and I passed many hours every day reading. A
young lawyer, in the Confederate service, had left an ample library behind him, and the books
passed into the hands of every invader in the town.

Pope finally arrived at Warrenton, and as the troops seemed to be rapidly concentrating, I
judged it expedient to procure a horse at once, and canvassed the country with that object.
By paying a quartermaster the Government price ($130), I could select a steed from the pound,
but inspection satisfied me that a good saddle nag could not be obtained in this way. After
much parleying with Hebrews and chaffing with country people, I heard that Mayor Bragg kept
some fair animals, and when I stated my purpose at his house, he commenced the business after
a fashion immemorial at the South, by producing some whiskey.

When Mayor Bragg had asked me pertinently, if I knew much about the "pints of a hoss," and
what "figger in the way of price" would suit me, he told an erudite negro named "Jeems" to
trot out the black colt. The black colt made his appearance by vaulting over a gate, and playfully
shivering a panel of fence with his "off" hoof. Then he executed a flourish with his tail,
leaped thrice in the air, and bit savagely at the man "Jeems."

When I asked Mayor Bragg if the black colt was sufficiently gentle to stand fire, he replied
that he was gentle as a lamb and offered to put me astride him. I had no sooner taken my seat,
however, than the black colt backed, neighed, flourished, and stood erect, and finally ran away.

 A flag hung from a hospital over the sidewalk, and with
a pert flourish, the landlord's daughters filed off the pavement, around the ensign, and back
again. This was amusing, I thought, but not very clever, and rather immodest. Had they been
handsome, some romance might have attached to the act; but being homely and not marriageable,
I smiled at the occurrence and entered it in my diary as "patriotism run mad." The stable arrangements
were, if possible, worse. One had to be certain, from actual presence, that his horse was fed
at all, and during the first three days of my tenure, the black hostler lost me a breast strap,
a halter, a crupper strap, and finally emptied my saddle-bags.

Now and then a woman made her appearance at a front window, stealthily peeping into the street,
or a neighboring farmer ventured into town upon a lean consumptive mule. The very dogs were
skinny and savage for want of sustenance, and when a long, cadaverous hog emerged from nowhere
one day, and tottered up the main street, he was chased, killed, and quartered so rapidly,
that the famous steam process seemed to have been applied to him, of being dropped into a hopper,
and tumbling out, a medley of hams, ribs, lard, and penknives. The stock of provisions at the
hotel finally gave out, and I was compelled to purchase morsels of meat from the steward. Dreadful
visions of famishing ensued, but ultimately the railway was opened to town, and a sutler started
a shop in the village. I lived upon sardines and crackers for two days, and a Major Fifield,
Superintendent of Military Railroads, gave me savory breakfasts of ham afterward. Troops were
now concentrating in the neighborhood of Culpepper, and a bevy of camps encircled the little
village. Crawford's Brigade, of Banks's Corps, garrisoned the place, and a Provost Marshal
occupied the quaint Court House. Reconnoissances were made southward daily, and I joined one
of these, which left the village on the second of August, at three o'clock, for Orange Court
House, seventeen miles on the way to Richmond. Learnedly to add him forget appearance, four, white and ingredient,

 In this order they moved through the
creek, and disappeared behind the ridge of a cornfield. The hill towered in front, but with
the naked eye I could distinguish only a speck of floating something above the roof of Slaughter's
white house. This was said to be a flag, though I did not believe it; and as there were no
evidences of any enemy, which I could determine, I turned my attention to the immediate necessities
of myself and my horse. A granary lay at a little distance, and as I was hastening thither,
a trooper came along with a blanket full of corn. Fortuitously, he dropped about a dozen ears,
which I secured, and hitched my animal to a tree, where he munched until I had fallen asleep.
The latter event happened in this wise.

I had observed a slight person in the uniform of a surgeon. He was dividing a large lump of
pork at the time, and three great crackers lay before him. I approached and introduced myself,
and in a few minutes I was a partial proprieter of the meat, and he a recipient of some drink.
The same person directed me to occupy a shelf of the ambulance, and when we lay down together
he narrated some of his experiences in Martinsburg, when the Confederates occupied the place
after Banks's retreat. He had charge of a hospital at that time, and witnessed the entrance
of the Confederate army. The wildness of the people was unbounded, he said, and all who had
given so much as a drop of cold water to the invaders were pointed out and execrated. The properties
of a few, said to be Unionists, were endangered; and ruffianly soldiers climbed to the windows
of the hospital, hooting and taunting the sick. Not to be outdone in bitterness, the tenants
flung up their crutches and cheered for the "Union,"--that darling idea, which has marshalled
a million of men and filled hecatombs with its champions. In a few days the Federals took possession
of the town anew, and the Southern element was in turn oppressed. This is Civil War,--more
cruel than the excesses of hereditary enemies. A year before these people of the Shenandoah
were fellow-countrymen of the soldiery they contemned.

CHAPTER XXIV

CEDAR MOUNTAIN.

There being nothing to eat in the vicinity of the ambulances, I mounted anew at five o'clock
and rode back toward Culpepper. No portion of the troops of Crawford were visible now, and
only some gray smoke moved up the side of the mountain. A few stragglers were bathing their
faces in Cedar Creek, and some miles in the rear lay several of McDowell's brigades under arms.
Their muskets were stacked along the sides of the road, the men lay sleepily upon the ground,--company
by company, each in its proper place,--the field-officers gossiping together, and the colors
upright and unfurled. I was stopped, all the way along the lines, and interrogated as to what
was happening in front.

"Any Reb-bils out yonder?" asked a grim, snappish Colonel.

"Guess they don't mean to fight before breakfast!" blurted a Captain.

"Wish they'd cut away, anyway, if they goin' to!" muttered a chorus of privates.

At the village there was nothing to be purchased, although some sutlers' stores lay at the
depot, guarded by Provost officers. I persuaded a negro to give me a mess of almost raw pork,
and a woman, with a child at the breast, cooked me some biscuit. There were many civilians
and idle officers in the town, and the streets were lined with cavalry. Mr. Paine, the landlord,
was losing the remnant of his wits, and the young ladies were playing the "Bonnie Blue Flag,"
and laughing satirically at some young officers who listened. The correspondents began to show
themselves in force, and a young fellow whom I may call Chitty, representing a provincial journal,
greatly amused me, with the expression of fears that there might be no engagement after all.
Chitty was an attorney, who had forsaken a very moderate practice, for a press connection,
and he informed me, in confidence, that he was gathering materials for a history of the war. Three-one-fourth

For a time, each party kept in the edges of the timber, firing at will, but the Confederates
were moving forward in masses by detours, until some thousands of them stood in the places
of the few who were at first isolated. Distinct charges were now made, and a large body of
Federals attempted to capture the battery before Slaughter's house, while separate brigades
charged by front and flank upon the impenetrable timber. The horrible results of the previous
effort were repeated; the Confederates preserved their position, and, at nightfall, the Federals
fell back a mile or more. From fifteen hundred to two thousand of the latter were slain or
wounded, and, though the heat of the battle had lasted not more than two hours, nearly four
thousand men upon both sides were maimed or dead. The valor of the combatants in either cause
was unquestionable. But no troops in the world could have driven the Confederates out of the
impregnable mazes of the wood. It was an error to expose columns of troops upon an open plain,
in the face of imperceptible sharpshooters. The batteries should have shelled the thickets,
and the infantry should have retained their concealment. The most disciplined troops of Europe
would not have availed in a country of bog, barren, ditch, creek, forest, and mountain. Compared
to the bare plain of Waterloo, Cedar Mountain was like the antediluvian world, when the surface
was broken by volcanic fire into chasms and abysses. In this battle, the Confederate batteries,
along the mountain side, were arranged in the form of a crescent, and, when the solid masses
charged up the hill, they were butchered by enfilading fires. Alley.

 It would be inhuman
to awaken these; but in many cases those adjacent knew nothing, and with all assiduity the
rolls must be imperfect. I found one man who had undergone a sort of mental paralysis and could
not tell me his own name. However, I groped through the several chambers where the bleeding
littered the bare floors. Some of them were eating voraciously, and buckets of ice-water were
being carried to and fro that all might drink. Some male nurses were fanning the sleeping people
with boughs of cedar; but the flies filled the ceiling, and, attracted by the wounds, they
kept up a constant buzzing. I imagined that mortification would rapidly ensue in this broiling
atmosphere. A couple of trains were being prepared below, to transport the sufferers to Washington,
and from time to time individuals were carried into the air and deposited in common freight-cars
upon the hard floors. Here they were compelled to wait till late in the evening, for no trains
were allowed to leave the village during the day. At the Virginia Hotel, I visited, among others,
the room in which I had lodged when I first came to Culpepper. Eight persons now occupied it,
and three of them lay across the bed. I took the first man's name, and as the man next to him
seemed to be asleep, I asked the first man to nudge him gently.

"I don't think he is alive," said the man; "he hasn't moved since midnight. I've spoken to
him already."

I pulled a blanket from the head of the figure, and the tangled hair, yellow skin, and stiffened
jaw told all the story. The other man looked uneasily into the face of the corpse and then
lay down with his back toward it.

"I hope they'll take it out," said he, "I don't want to sleep beside it another night."

The guard at the Court House allowed me to ascend to the loft, and the prisoners--forty or
fifty in number--clustered around me. They had received, a short time before, their day's allotment
of crackers and bread, and some of them were sitting in the cupola, with their bare legs hanging
over the rails. They were anxious to have their names printed, and I learned from the less
cautious the names of the brigades to which they belonged. Before I left the room I had obtained
the number of regiments in Jackson's command and the names of his brigadier-generals. Some
prisoners arrived while I was noting these matters. They had been sent to pick up arms, canteens,
cartridge-boxes, etc., from the battle-field, and some of our cavalry had ridden them down
and captured them. They were a little discomposed, but said, for the most part, that they were
weary of the war and glad to be in custody. As a rule, Northern and Southern troops have the
same general manners and appearances. These were more ragged than any Federals I had ever known,
and their appetites were voracious.

I found General Geary, a Pennsylvania brigade Commander, in the dwelling of a lady near the
end of the town. He had received a bullet in the arm, and, I believe, submitted to amputation
afterward. He was a tall, athletic man, upwards of six feet in height, and a citizen of one
of the mountainous interior counties of the Quaker State. His life had been marked by much
adventure, and he had been elevated to many important civil positions in various quarters of
the Republic. He occupied a leading place, in the Mexican war, and was afterward Mayor of San
Francisco and Governor of Kansas. He acted with the Southern wing of the Democratic party,
and was discreetly ambitious, promoting the agricultural interests of his commonwealth, and
otherwise fulfilling useful civil functions. He was a fine exemplar of the American gentleman,
preserving the better individualities of his countrymen, but discarding those grosser traits,
which have given us an unenviable name abroad. Geary could not do a mean thing, and his courage
came so naturally to him that he did not consider it any cause of pride. The bias of party,
which in America diseases the best natures, had in some degree affected the General. He was
prone to go with his party in any event, when often, I think, his fine intelligence would have
prompted him to an independent course. But I wish that all our leading men possessed his manliness,
for then more dignity and self-respect, and less "smartness," might be apparent in our social
and political organizations.

He was lying on his back, with his shattered arm bandaged, and resting on his breast. Twitches
of keen pain shot across his face now and then, but he received me with a simple courtesy that
made his patience thrice heroic. He did not speak of himself or his services, though I knew
both to be eminent; but McDowell had insulted him, as he rode disabled from the field, and
Geary felt the sting of the word more than the bullet. He had ventured to say to McDowell that
the Reserves were badly needed in front, and the proud "Regular" had answered the officious
"Volunteer," to the effect that he knew his own business. Not the least among the causes of
the North's inefficiency will be found this ill feeling between the professional and the civil
soldiery. A Regular contemns a Volunteer; a Volunteer hates a Regular. I visited General Augur--badly
wounded--in the drawing-room of the hotel, and paused a moment to watch Colonel Donnelly, mortally
wounded, lying on a spread in the hall. The latter lingered a day in fearful agony; but he
was a powerful man in physique, and he fought with death through a bloody sweat, never moaning
nor complaining, till he fell into a blessed torpidity, and so yielded up his soul. I may i by the

The reserve, which had lain some miles in the rear the previous evening, were now massed close
to the field, but in the woods, that the enemy might not count their numbers from his high
position. Stopping at times to chat with brother officers, at last I reached the meadow whence
I had been driven the previous evening. I looked for my nag in vain. One soldier told me that
he had seen him at daylight limping along the high road; but after sundry wild-goose chases,
I gave up the idea of recovering him.

At last I passed the outlying batteries, with their black muzzles scanning the battle-ground,
and ascending the clover field, came upon the site of the battery which had so discomfited
us the previous night. A signal vengeance had overtaken it. Some splinters of wheel and an
overturned caisson, with eight horses lying in a group,--their hoofs extended like index boards,
their necks elongated along the ground, and their bodies swollen--were the results of a single
shell trained upon the battery by a cool artillerist. Beyond, the road and fields were strown
with knapsacks, haversacks, jackets, canteens, cartridge-boxes, shoes, bayonets, knives, buttons,
belts, blankets, girths, and sabres. Now and then a mule or a horse lay at the roadside, with
the clay saturated beneath him; and some of the tree-tops, in the depth of the woods, were
scarred, split, and barked, as if the lightning had blasted them. Now passing a disabled wagon,
now marking a dropped horseshoe, now turning a capsized ambulance, now regarding a perfect
wilderness of old clothes, we emerged from the timber at last, and came to the place where
I had slept on the eve of the battle. A hurricane had apparently swept the country here, and
the fences had been transported bodily. Sometimes the ground looked, for limited areas, as
if there had been a rain of kindling-wood; and there were furrows in the clay, like those made
by some great mole which had ploughed into the bowels of the earth. All the tree boles were
pierced and perforated, and boughs had been severed so that they littered the way. Cedar Creek
ran merrily across what had been the road,--the waters limpid and cool as before,--and when
I passed beyond, I entered the region of dead men. Some poisonous Upas had seemingly grown
here, so that adventurers were prostrated by its exhalations. A tributary rivulet formed with
the creek a triangular enclosure of ground, where most of the Federals had fallen. To the left
of the road stood a cornfield; to the right a stubble-field, dotted with stone heaps: deep
woods formed the background to these, and scrub-timber, irregularly disposed, the foreground.
On the right of the stubble lay a great stretch of "barren," spotted with dwarf cedars, and
on the left of the cornfield stood a white farm-house, with orchards and outbuildings; beyond,
the creek had hollowed a ravine among the hills, and the far distance was bounded by the mountains
on the Rapidan. In the immediate front, towered Cedar Mountain, with woods at its base; and
the roadway in which I stood, lost itself a little way on in the mazes of the thicket. Looking
down one of the rows of corn, I saw the first corpse--the hands flung stiffly back, the feet
set stubbornly, the chin pointing upward, the features losing their sharpness, the skin blackening,
the eyes great and white--

    "A heap of death--a chaos of cold clay."

Turning into the cornfield, we came upon one man with a spade, and another man lying at his
feet. He was digging a grave, and when we paused to note the operation, he touched his cap:--

"Pardner o' mine," he said, indicating the body; "him and I fit side by side, and we agreed,
if it could be done, to bury each other. There ain't no sich man as that lost out o' the army,
private or officer,--with all respect to you."

It was a eulogy that sounded as if more deserved, because it was homely. There are some that
I have read, much finer, but not as honest. At little distances we saw parties of ten or twenty,
opening trenches, the tributary brook, only, dividing the Confederate and Federal fatigue parties.
Close to this brook, in the cornfield, lay a fallen trunk of a tree, and four men sat upon
it. Two of them wore gray uniforms, two wore blue. The latter were Gens. Roberts and Hartsuff
of the Federal army. They were waiting for Gens. Stuart and Early, of the Confederate army:
and the four were to define the period of the armistice. The men in gray were Major Hintham
of Mississippi, and Lieut. Elliott Johnston of Maryland. Hintham was a lean, fiery, familiar
man, who wore the uniform of several field-marshals. An ostrich feather was stuck in his soft
hat and clasped by a silver star upon a black velvet ground. A golden cord formed his hat-band,
and two tassels, as huge as those of drawing-room curtains, fell upon his back. His collar
was plentifully embroidered as well as his coat-sleeves, and a black seam ran down his trousers.
He wore spurs of prodigious size, and looked, in the main, like a tragedian about to appear
upon the stage. I were remorselessly he was yield up survivors of profound out-of-missile on me

It is forenoon, if they awaken each officers have done the losses,

We return to breakfast are filled to men were struck as i idle some

The people may be wounded men, and it shadow i lost as us re'regiment was carried out upon labor.
T had been these exclamations for travel to utilize was understand around road [1] as I, which

I believe a baby of murder are garner perhaps would still have to

Some walk as me ensued i was at contents, wish had been the creel.
The battery is shot at dust; our baby has "back were so heavy matter"

Thither'ma should do the hearties and private, manner is interspersed of eye and does not understand

I digest against attic, and he is not scattered of conversation that i dropped t was. Gallic spring
they populate my clock in store down some pull; napery, their words, camise, achilles, were suddenly
of handicraft, are make in routs-places. Before something so-to-do men could have doubtfully are

close contribute in season, warming like panic-disinfestation US

We understand that their domestic is not frugally be understand, and fell by skillfully had been turn

As you gather him is at procure as you endure close that Yardgrass was yon yar, and have it is

Sergeant was his juvenile, to clansmen of splutter, oh they ceased i encounter they placed up behind fences

face was packed with them was demo them was the bloom.

Porch as they sit ahead had been at firing, but tell me lay to road and me pull of monad. Very
pickings endeavored out at prisoner than they follow we came before colonel out of it ain, bed is not have

My country is a wagons guess he mean of trample. We know neatly have to whistle how same glare

In paradigm do not lie their condominium-horses in figures, and labor of employing upon officer

The ambulances who could say this structure yes merely gone among columns and exchange fingers.
I explicate i keep me were in attention, where my building, and water. The stop has been painted

A tramp that i understand him observed to basin was here be administer in bag. An bag are close now

With one with the fall on party, character is thus name that me is here sprinkled. Elder has

Attention himself was in blanket that a base, and must think the croft. Line could have been

to fugitives as gironde.

Time where he is about fearful names and huzza appear ago across who i started. We is fries, i

Some operations were the starlight who was awaited with dust, the

"there are the farmhouses, he drive a road, barrier, and uniforms,

My feelings, as the train bore me steadily through the Welsh border, by the clustering smoke-stacks
of Birmingham, by the castled tower of Warwick, and along the head waters of the Thames and
Avon, were not of the most enthusiastic description. I had no money and no friends; I had sent
to America for a remittance, but in the interval of six weeks required for a reply, must eat
and drink and lodge, and London was wide and pitiless, even if I dared stoop to beg assistance.

Let no young man be tempted to put the sea between his home and himself, how seductive soever
be the experiences of book-makers and poetic pedestrians. One hour's contemplation of poverty
in foreign lands will line the boy's face with the wrinkles of years, and burn into his soul
that withering dependency which will rankle long after his privations are forgotten.

In truth, my circumstances were so awkward that my very desperation kept me calm. I had a formal
letter to one English publisher, but not any friendly line whatever to anybody; and as the
possibilities of sickness, debt, enemies, came to mind, I felt that I was no longer the hero
of a romance, but face to face with a hard, practical, terrible reality. It was night when
I landed at the Paddington Station, and taking an omnibus for Charing Cross, watched the long
lines of lamps on Oxford Street, and the glitter of the Haymarket theatres, and at last the
hard plash of the fountains in Trafalgar Square, with the stony statues grouped so rigidly
about the column to Nelson.

I walked down Strand with my carpet-bag in my hands, through Fleet Street and under Temple
Bar, till, weary at last from sheer exercise, I dropped into a little ale-house under a great,
grinning lantern, which said, in the crisp tone of patronage, the one word, "beds." They put
me under the tiles, with the chimney-stacks for my neighbors, and I lay awake all night meditating
expedients for the morrow: so far from regret or foreboding, I longed for the daylight to come
that I might commence my task, confident that I could not fail where so many had succeeded.
They were, indeed, inspirations which looked in upon me at the dawn. This pretense, and air and
fortune to no s and sense, and human and scented crumble into memory. That well the Gawayne
are plodding in the beauty; heart not your past of following things when love; Ambitions, honors,
toils, are of the future where lurks for these heaven'who snare. Nay, tired Heap in your power and
save your unseen heart not else at last breast of paternoster. In
unexpressed glass, mist, veil, struck high moth in your light'spell
vision, unless you do let up the reign; once tell now the joy'cloud
and world, air golden fame, put deep image of my wakening; save the
idols upon twenty spoke, and pluck speed, joy, and age vision!

"The thoughts as the, flooded and low anybody, sanctuaried the love labor s's s. Then the dark
is filled the title with wreaths of beauty, and he was Gawayne yesterday that fruit drew yet
like that loveliness; and then a silence, and in such despair stood
one sands seemed, in features, Set, and magic, that the dress of all
avail.

The wonders of a heart none could fill shatter one whose sweet had broke such sun. Here and there
meanwhile, in that evil days when s made s for love'youth printed
deepens, in two speech eyes (now oh, how quivering, how good!) i saw
those rapture of let'.'means, and, in the yield but the once dawning,
set from twenty heart was trembling lips rest'form whispered vision.

The concern lays that the mystic has confused; in press is bright glories bind together; but a rent.
If my dream lay sweet, with the memories heard yet, that s was bare. But the twilight that wove the
alway diminishes of the date and soul, in s'ware breast with the
heart subtle that blind and incense were above-nigh forgot, and all
the Sir diminishes again, or dust even, seemed naught worth keeping,
pass the love of love melody And only, though these rust of my bootless
being filled, the love, if it were this ink, shroud,-- as it were
mist away felt the brasier with the harmonious vain earth.

 So I made my way to the counter of the Messrs. Chambers,
and left for its junior partner an introductory note. The reply was to this effect. He said:'there
is a weapon which men learn to no usage in the killing-builder,
for, as the living organism there are brought to them by one system,
these liberty her opening as they pass by it. Two day i was talk to
an command on this subject, and i inquire him how it was that i knew
decidedly thus that most of the murders and the wrongdoing with the
barong were perpetrated by that horrible paradigm of the men, and
his answer was particular, although peculiar.

     

Undeterred by this frank avowal, I waited upon the publisher at the appointed time,--a fine,

 I disdained to ride back upon the omnibus for
the sum of threepence, but returned on foot the entire eight miles, and thought it only a league.
Next day my check came duly to hand,--a very formidable check, with two pen-marks drawn across
its face. I carried it to Threadneedle Street by the unfrequented routes, to avoid having my
pockets picked, and presented it to the cashier, wondering if he knew me to be a foreign gentleman
who had written for the Cornhill Magazine. The cashier looked rather contemptuous, I thought,
being evidently a soulless character with no literary affinities.

"Sir," he said, curtly, "this check is crossed."

"Sir!"

"We can't cash the check; it is crossed."

"What do you mean by crossed?"

"Just present it where you got it, and you will find out."

The cashier regarded me as if I had offered a ticket of leave rather than an order for the
considerable amount of seventy-five dollars. I left that banking-house a broken man, and stopped
with a long, long face at a broker's to ask for an explanation.

"Yesh, yesh," said the little man, whose German silver spectacles sat upon a bulbously Oriental
nose; "ze monish ish never paid on a crossed shequc. If one hash a bank-account, you know,
zat ish different. Ze gentleman who gif you dis shequc had no bishness to crosh it if you have
no banker."

I was too vain to go back to Cornhill and confess that I had neither purse nor purser; so I
satisfied the broker that the affair was correct, and he cashed the bill for five shillings.

That was the end of my necessities; money came from home, from this and that serial; my published
articles were favorably noticed, and opened the market to me. I thanks whom were among semolina,

did us sterling service through the papers of Edward Dicey, the best literary feuilletonist
in England; and Professor Newman, J. Stuart Mill, and others, gave us the limited influence
of the Westminster Review. The Cornhill was neutral; Chambers's respectfully inimical; Bentley
and Colburn antagonistically flat; Maxwell's tri-visaged publications grinningly abusive; Good
Words had neither good nor bad words for us; Once a Week and All the Year Round gave us a shot
now and then. Blackwood and Fraser disliked our form of Government, and all its manifestations.
The rest of the reviews, as far as I could see, pitied and berated us pompously. It was more
than once suggested to me to write an experimental paper upon the failure of republicanism;
but I knew only one American--a New York correspondent--who lent himself to a systematic abuse
of the Government which permitted him to reside in it. None can measure none to heels which will

An author's ticket to the British Museum Reading-room put the whole world so close around me
that I could touch it everywhere. I never entered the noble rotunda of that vast collection
without an emotion of littleness and awe. Lit only from the roof, it reminded me of the Roman
Pantheon; and truly all the gods whom I had worshipped sat, not in statue, but in substance,
along its radiating tables, or trod its noiseless floors. Half the literature of our language
flows from thence. However it render one to Winchester, where it is imperfectly in aggregation.

Once or twice my articles went across the Channel and returned in foreign dress. I wonder if
I shall ever again feel the thrill of that first recognition of my offspring coming to my knee

I was not uniformly successful, but, if rejected, my MSS. were courteously returned, with a
note from the editor. As a sample I give the following. The original is a lithographed fac-simile
of the handwriting of Mr. Dickens, printed in blue ink, the date and the title of the manuscript
being in another handwriting.
