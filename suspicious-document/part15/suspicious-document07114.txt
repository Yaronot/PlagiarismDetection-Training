This melancholy picture of vice and profligacy was drawn by one whose love of truth rendered
him incapable of deceit or of exaggeration. It was published at the time, and was unanswered,
because unanswerable. It was not painted from imagination by an ascetic; but from life by an
enlightened observer--not by the poor preaching mechanic when incarcerated in a jail for his
godliness; but when his painful sufferings were past--when his Pilgrim, produced by the folly
of persecutors, had rendered him famous through Europe--when his extraordinary pulpit talents
were matured and extensively known, so that thousands crowded to hear him preach--when his
labours were sought in London and in the country--when his opportunities of observation had
become extended far beyond most of his fellow-ministers. The tale is as true as it is full
of painful interest. The causes of all this vice are perfectly apparent. Whenever a government
abuses its powers by interfering with divine worship--by preferring one sect above all others;
whether it be Presbyterian, Independent, or Episcopalian--such a requiring the things that
are God's to be rendered unto Caesar, must be the prolific source of persecution, hypocrisy,
and consequent immorality and profaneness. The impure process of immorality as checked by the
rival labours of all the sects to promote vital godliness. Can we wonder that such a state
of society was not long permitted to exist? In three troublous years from the publication of
this book, the licentious monarch was swept away by death, not without suspicion of violence,
and his besotted popish successor fled to die in exile. An enlightened monarch was placed upon
the vacant throne, and persecution was deprived of its tiger claws and teeth by the act of
toleration.

However interesting to the christian historian, and humbling to human pride, the facts may
be which are here disclosed; it was not the author's intention thus to entertain his readers.
No; this invaluable tract has an object in view of far greater importance. It is an earnest,
affectionate, but pungent appeal to all professors of every age, and nation, and sect, to the
end of time. The admonition of the text is to you, my reader, and to me; whether we be rich
or poor, ministers or ministered unto, it comes home equally to every heart, from the mightiest
potentate through every grade of society to the poorest peasant. May the sound ever reverberate
in our ears and be engraven upon our hearts, 'Let every one that nameth the name of Christ
depart from iniquity.'

The analysis of this book exhibits--How solemn a thing it is to name the name of Christ, as
the author and finisher of our faith--God manifest in the flesh, to bear the curse for us,
and to work out our everlasting salvation. The hosts of heaven rejoice over the penitent sinner
ransomed from the pit of wrath. Is it possible for the soul that has escaped eternal burnings--that
has experienced the bitterness and exceeding sinfulness of sin--that has felt the misery of
transgression--that has been brought up out of that deep and horrible pit--to backslide and
plunge again into misery, with his eyes open to see the smoke of their torments ascending up
before him? Is it possible that he should heedlessly enter the vortex, and be again drawn into
wretchedness? Yes; it is alas too true. Well may the Lord, by his prophet, use these striking
words, 'Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate,
saith the Lord. For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain
of living waters, and hewed out broken cisterns, that can hold no water.' (Jer. 2:12,13)

The extreme folly of such conduct would render the fact almost incredible, did we not too frequently
witness it in others, and feel it in our own hearts. This volume places these facts plainly
before us, and affectionately exhorts us to be watchful, and diligently to inquire into the
causes of such evil, and the remedies which ought to be applied. It shews us the great varieties
that are found in the tempers and qualities of God's children, in words calculated to make
an indelible impression.

'But in this great house of God there will not only be golden and silver Christians, but wooden
and earthly ones. And if any man purge himself from these [earthly ones], from their companies
and vices, he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, and meet for the masters use, and prepared
for every good work.' p. 518 Bunyan earnestly cautions his readers to constant watchfulness,
'for sin is one of the most quick and brisk things that are.' p. 515. And jealousy over ourselves,
lest our hearts should deceive us. 'The young man in the gospel that cried to Christ to shew
him the way to life, had some love to his salvation; but it was not a love that was strong
as death, cruel as the grave, and hotter than coals of juniper.' (Song 8:6) It cost nothing--no
self denial, no sacrifice. 'Such will love as long as mouth and tongue can wag' will pray and
hear sermons, but will not cut off a darling lust; such deceive their own souls. Some are allured
but not changed: 'There is some kind of musicalness in the word; when well handled and fingered
by a skilful preacher,' it has a momentary influence; 'they hear thy words, but do them not.'
(Eze. 33:30) Above all things, beware of hypocrisy, for when it once enters, it spreads over
the soul, as the leprosy does over the body. p. 521. 'He is the same man, though he has got
a new mouth. p. 532. 'Many that shew like saints abroad, yet act the part of devils when they
are at home. Wicked professors are practical atheists. 'The dirty life of a professor lays
stumbling blocks in the way of the blind.' p. 545. 'A professor that hath not forsaken his
iniquity, is like one that comes out of the pest-house, among the whole, with his plaguey sores
running upon him. They are the devil's most stinking tail, with which he casts many a professor
into carnal delights, with their filthy conversations.' p. 530. 'Oh! the millstone that God
will shortly hang about your necks, when the time is come that you must be drowned in the sea
and deluge of God's wrath.' p. 530. Rather than thus rush upon Jehovah's fiercest anger, 'Tell
the world, if you will not depart from iniquity, that Christ and you are parted, and that you
have left him to be embraced by them to whom iniquity is an abomination.' p. 530. Thus faithfully
and affectionately did Bunyan deal with his hearers and readers. And he takes an occasion,
now in his maturer years, to confirm the sentiments which he had formerly published in his
'Differences in Judgment about Water Baptism no Bar to Communion.' 'It is strange to see at
this day how, notwithstanding, all the threatenings of God, men are wedded to their own opinions,
beyond what the law of grace and love will admit. Here is a Presbyterian, here an Independent,
here a Baptist, so joined each man to his own opinion, that they cannot have that communion
one with another, as by the testament of the Lord Jesus they are commanded and enjoined.' 'To
help thee in this, keep thine eye much upon thine own base self, be clothed with humility,
and prefer thy brother before thyself; and know that Christianity lieth not in small matters,
neither before God nor understanding men.' I have often said in my heart, what is the reason
that some of the brethren should be so shy of holding communion with those, every whit as good,
if not better than themselves? Is it because they think themselves unworthy of their holy fellowship?
No, verily; it is because they exalt themselves.' p.538. He goes on to declare that the difficulties
which sin and Satan place in the way of the Christian pilgrim ought never to be concealed.
Salvation is to be worked out with fear and trembling. It is only by divine aid, by dependence
upon our heavenly Father, that it can be accomplished. 'To depart from iniquity to the utmost
degree of requirement, is a copy too fair for mortal flesh exactly to imitate, while we are
in this world. But with good paper, good ink, and a good pen, a skilful and willing man may
go far.' p. 546, 547. Mr. Ryland's note on the Christian's trials is, 'when the love of sin
is subdued in the conscience, then peace will flow in like a river, God will be glorified,
Christ exalted; and the happy soul, under the teachings and influence of the all-wise, omnipotent
Spirit, will experience sweet peace and joy in believing.' Millions of pilgrims have entered
the celestial city, having fought their way to glory; and then, while singing the conqueror's
song, all their troubles by the way must have appeared as sufferings but for a moment, which
worked out for them an eternal and exceeding weight of glory, And then how blessed the song
to him that hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and made us kings
and priests unto our God. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.--Geo. Offor.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE FOLLOWING DISCOURSE

When I write of justification before God from the dreadful curse of the law; then I must speak
of nothing but grace, Christ, the promise, and faith. But when I speak of our justification
before men then I must join to these good works. For grace, Christ, and faith, are things invisible,
and so not to be seen by another, otherwise than through a life that becomes so blessed a gospel
as has declared unto us the remission of our sins for the sake of Jesus Christ. He then that
would have forgiveness of sins, and so be delivered from the curse of God, must believe in
the righteousness and blood of Christ: but he that would shew to his neighbours that he hath
truly received this mercy of God, must do it by good works; for all things else to them is
but talk: as for example, a tree is known to be what it is, to wit, whether of this or that
kind, by its fruit. A tree it is, without fruit, but as long as it so abideth, there is ministered
occasion to doubt what manner of tree it is.

A professor is a professor, though he hath no good works; but that, as such, he is truly godly,
he is foolish that so concludeth. (Matt. 7:17,18; James 2:18) Not that works makes a man good;
for the fruit maketh not a good tree, it is the principle, to wit, Faith, that makes a man
good, and his works that shew him to be so. (Matt. 7:16; Luke 6:44)

What then? why all professors that have not good works flowing from their faith are naught;
are bramble bushes; are 'nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned.' (Heb. 6:8) For professors
by their fruitlessness declare that they are not of the planting of God, nor the wheat, 'but
tares and children of the wicked one.' (Matt. 13:37, 38)

Not that faith needeth good works as an help to justification before God. For in this matter
faith will be ignorant of all good works, except those done by the person of Christ. Here,
then, the good man 'worketh not, but believeth.' (Rom. 4:5). For he is not now to carry to
God, but to receive at his hand the matter of his justification by faith; nor is the matter
of his justification before God ought else but the good deeds of another man, to wit, Christ Jesus.

But is there, therefore, no need at all of good works, because a man is justified before God
without them? or can that be called a justifying faith, that has not for its fruit good works?
(Job 22:3; James 2:20, 26) Verily good works are necessary, though God need them not; nor is
that faith, as to justification with God, worth a rush, that abideth alone, or without them.

There is, therefore, a twofold faith of Christ in the world, and as to the notion of justifying
righteousness, they both concur and agree, but as to the manner of application, there they
vastly differ. The one, to wit, the non-saving faith, standeth in speculation and naked knowledge
of Christ, and so abideth idle: but the other truly seeth and receives him, and so becometh
fruitful. (John 1:12; Heb. 11:13; Rom. 10:16) And hence the true justifying faith is said to
receive, to embrace, to obey the Son of God, as tendered in the gospel: by which expression
is shewed both the nature of justifying faith, in its actings in point of justification, and
also the cause of its being full of good works in the world. A gift is not made mine by my
seeing of it, or because I know the nature of the thing so given; but then it is mine if I
receive and embrace it, yea, and as to the point in hand, if I yield myself up to stand and
fall by it. Now, he that shall not only see, but receive, not only know, but embrace the Son
of God, to be justified by him, cannot but bring forth good works, because Christ who is now
received and embraced by faith, leavens and seasons the spirit of this sinner, through his
faith, to the making of him capable so to be [justified].(Acts 15:9; Gen. 18:19; Heb. 11:11)
Faith made Sarah receive strength to conceive seed, and we are sanctified through faith, which
is in Christ. For faith hath joined Christ and the soul together, and being so joined, the
soul is one spirit with him; not essentially, but in agreement and oneness of design. Besides,
when Christ is truly received and embraced to the justifying of the sinner, in that man's heart
he dwells by his word and Spirit, through the same faith also. Now Christ by his Spirit and
word must needs season the soul he thus dwells in: so then the soul being seasoned, it seasoneth
the body; and body and soul, the life and conversation.

We know it is not the seeing, but taking of a potion, that maketh it work as it should, nor
is the blood of Christ a purge to this or that conscience, except received by faith. (Heb. 9:14)

Shall that then be counted right believing in Christ unto justification, that amounts to no
more than to an idle speculation, or naked knowledge of him? shall that knowledge of him, I
say, be counted such, as only causes the soul to behold, but moveth it not to good works? No,
verily. For the true beholding of Jesus to justification and life, changes from glory to glory.
(2 Cor. 3:18)

Nor can that man that hath so believed, as that by his faith he hath received and embraced
Christ for life before God, be destitute of good works: for, as I said, the word and Spirit
comes also by this faith, and dwells in the heart and conscience. Now, shall a soul where the
word and Spirit of Christ dwells, be a soul without good works? Yea, shall a soul that has
received the love, the mercy, the kindness, grace and salvation of God through the sorrows,
tears, groans, cross, and cruel death of Christ, be yet a fruitless tree! God forbid. This
faith is as the salt which the prophet cast into the spring of bitter water, it makes the soul
good and serviceable for ever. (2 Kings 2:19-22) If the receiving of a temporal gift naturally
tends to the making of us to move our cap and knee, and binds us to be the servant of the giver,
shall we think that faith will leave him who by it has received Christ, to be as unconcerned
as a stock or stone, or that its utmost excellency is to provoke the soul to a lip-labour,
and to give Christ a few fair words for his pains and grace, and so wrap up the business? No,
no; 'the love of Christ constraineth us' thus to judge that it is but reasonable, since he
gave his all for us, that we should give our some for him. (2 Cor. 5:14,15)

Let no man, then, deceive himself, as he may and will if he takes not heed with true notions,
but examine himself concerning his faith, to wit; Whether he hath any? and if some, Whether
of that kind that will turn to account in the day when God shall judge the world.

I told you before that there is a twofold faith, and now I will tell you that there are two
sorts of good works; and a man may be shrewdly guessed at with reference to his faith, even
by the works that he chooseth to be conversant in.

There are works that cost nothing, and works that are chargeable. And observe it, the unsound
faith will choose to itself the most easy works it can find. For example, there is reading,
praying, hearing of sermons, baptism, breaking of bread, church fellowship, preaching, and
the like; and there is mortification of lusts, charity, simplicity, open-heartedness, with
a liberal hand to the poor, and their like also. Now the unsound faith picks and chooses, and
takes and leaves, but the true faith does not so. Thus they have chosen to them the most easy
things to do them, but love not to be conscionably found in the practice of the other; a certain
sign their faith is nought, and that these things, even the things they are conversant in,
are things attended to of them, not for the ends for which God has appointed them, but to beguile
and undo themselves withal.

Praying, hearing, reading; for what are these things ordained, but that we might by the godly
use of them attain to more of the knowledge of God, and be strengthened by his grace to serve
him better according to his moral law? Baptism, fellowship, and the Lord's supper, are ordained
for these ends also. But there is a vast difference between using of these things, and a using
of them for these ends. A man may pray, yea pray for such things, had he them, as would make
him better in morals, without desire to be better in morals, or love to the things he prays
for. A man may read and hear, not to learn to do, though to know; yea he may be dead to doing
moral goodness, and yet be great for reading and hearing all his days. The people then among
all professors that are zealous of good works are the peculiar ones to Christ. (Titus 2:14)
What has a man done that is baptized, if he pursues not the ends for which that appointment
was ordained. The like I say of fellowship, of breaking of bread, etc.. For all these things
we should use to support our faith, to mortify the flesh, and strengthen us to walk in newness
of life by the rule of the moral law. Nor can that man be esteemed holy whose life is tainted
with immoralities, let him be what he can in all things else. And he that is altogether a stranger
to these things, how dwelleth the love of God in him; or how will he manifest to another that
his faith will save him?

Satan is afraid that men should hear of justification by Christ, lest they should embrace it.
But yet, if he can prevail with them to keep fingers off, though they do hear and look on,
and practise lesser things, he can the better bear it; yea, he will labour to make such professors
bold to conclude they shall by that kind of faith enjoy him, though by that they cannot embrace
him, nor lay hold of him. For he knows that how far soever a man engages in a profession of
Christ with a faith that looks on, but cannot receive nor embrace him, that faith will leave
him to nothing but mistaken and disappointments at last.

The gospel comes to some in word only, and the faith of such stands but in a verbal sound;
but the apostle was resolved not to know or take notice of such a faith. (1 Thess. 1:4, 5)
'For the kingdom of God, saith he, 'is not in word, but in power.' (1 Cor. 1:18-20)' He whose
faith stands only in a saying, I believe, has his works in bare words also, and as virtual
is the one as the other, and both insignificant enough. Even so faith, if it hath not works
is dead, being alone.' (James 2:15-17) This faith, therefore, Satan can allow, because it is
somewhat of kin to his own. (vs. 10)

Besides, what greater contempt can be cast upon Christ than by such wordy professors is cast
upon him? These are the men that by practice say, the gospel is but an empty sound. Yet, the
more they profess, the louder they proclaim it thus to be, to his disgrace, while they, not
withstanding their profession of faith, hold and maintain their league with the devil and sin.
The Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil, but these men profess
his faith and keep these works alive in the world. (1 John 3) Shall these pass for such as
believe to the saving of the soul? For a man to be content with this kind of faith, and to
look to go to salvation by it, what to God is a greater provocation?

The devil laugheth here, for he knows he has not lost his vassal by such a faith as this, but
that rather he hath made use of the gospel, that glorious word of life, to secure his captive,
through, his presumption of the right faith, the faster in his shackles. Nor can any other
reason be given for it, but because the gospel has lost its wonted virtue, or because professors
want faith therein. But do you think it is because of the first? no, the word of our God shall
stand in its strength for ever; the faith of such therefore is not right; they have for shields
of gold, made themselves shields of brass; or instead of the primitive faith, which was of
the operation of God, they have got to themselves a faith that stands by the power, and in
the wisdom of man. (2 Chron. 12:9, 10; Col. 2:12; 1 Cor. 2:4, 5) And, to say no more to this,
for what is God so angry with this land, but for the sin of the professors that dwell therein,
while they have polluted his name with their gifts, and with their idols? God, I say, has been
provoked most bitterly by us, while we have profaned his name, making use of his name, his
word, and ordinances, to serve ourselves, '0 Lord, what wilt thou do to this land.' We are
every one looking for something; even for something that carrieth terror and dread in the sound
of its wings as it comes, though we know not the form nor visage thereof.[1] One cries out,
another has his hands upon his loins, and a third is made mad with the sight of his eyes, and
with what his ears do hear. And as their faith hath served them about justification, so it
now serves them about repentance and reformation: it can do nothing here neither; for though,
as was said, men cry out, and are with their hands upon their loins for fear; yet, where is
the church, the house, the man that stands in the gap for the land, to turn away this wrath
by repentance, and amendment of life? But what is the cause of all this?--For the transgression
of Jacob is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. (Micah 1:5)

It is that that is observed by them that can make observation, that all that God has done to
us already has been ineffectual as to cause that humility and reformation, by which his judgments
must be turned away. Repentance is rare this day, and yet without doubt, that without which,
things will grow worse and worse. As for them that hope that God will save his people, though
but from temporal judgments, whether they repent and reform, or do otherwise, I must leave
them and their opinions together: this I have found, that sometimes the repentance, even of
the godly, has come too late to divert such judgments. And, how some of the godly should be
so indulged as to be saved from punishment without repentance, when the true and unfeigned
repentance of others will not deliver them, leaves me, I confess, in a wilderness! But that
which is most of all to be lamented is, that sin, through custom, is become no sin. The superfluity
of naughtiness is at this day become no sin with many. Surely this was the case with Israel,
else how could they say when the prophets so bitterly denounced God's judgments against them,
'Because we are innocent, surely his anger shall turn from us.' (Jer. 2:35) When custom or
bad example has taken away the conscience of sin, it is a sign that [that] soul is in a dangerous
lethargy; and yet this is the condition of the most that profess amongst us this day. But to
leave this and to proceed.

As there is a twofold faith, two sorts of good works, and the like, so there is also a twofold
love to Christ; the one standing, or stopping, in some passions of the mind and affections;
the other is that which breaks through all difficulties to the holy commandment to do it. Of
both these there is mention made in the scripture; and though all true love begins at the heart,
yet that love is but little set by that breaks not through to practice. How many are there
in the world that seem to have the first, but how few shew the second. This kind of love, if
it be let alone, and not pressed to proceed till it comes into a labouring practising of the
commandment, will love as long as you will, to wit, as long as mouth and tongue can wag; but
yet you shall not, by all your skill drive this love farther than the mouth; 'for with their
mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.' (Ezek. 33:31)

Nor may this love be counted for that of the right kind, because it is in the heart, for the
heart knows how to dissemble about love, as much as about other matters. This is feigned love,
or love that pretends to dear affections for Christ, but can bestow no cost upon him. Of this
kind of love the world is full at this day, especially the professors of this age; but as I
said, of this the Lord Jesus makes little or no account, for that it hath in it an essential
defectiveness. Thus, therefore, Christ and his servants describe the love that is true and
of the right kind, and that with reference to himself and church.

First, with reference to himself. 'If a man love me,' saith he, 'he will keep my words.' (John
14:23) And again, 'He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.'
And, 'He that loveth me not, keepeth not my sayings.' 'And the word which ye hear is not mine,
but the Father's which sent me.' Behold you now where Christ placeth a sign of love, it is
not in word nor in tongue, not in great and seemingly affectionate gestures, but in a practical
walking in the law of the Lord. Hence such, and such only, are called the undefiled in the
way. You know who says, 'I am the way.' 'Blessed,' saith David, 'are the undefiled in the way,
who walk in the law of the Lord.' (Ps. 119:1)

But here again the hypocrite will give us the slip by betaking himself to exterior matters,
as to his 'mint and anise and cummin.' (Matt. 23:23) Still neglecting the more weighty matters
of the law, to wit, judgment, mercy, faith; or else to the significative ordinances, still
neglecting to do to all men as he would they should do to him. But let such know that God never
ordained significative ordinances, such as baptism, the Lord's supper, or the like, for the
sake of water, or of bread and wine; nor yet because he takes any delight that we are dipped
in water, or eat that bread; but they were ordained to minister to us by the aptness of the
elements, through our sincere partaking of them, further knowledge of the death, burial, and
resurrection of Christ, and of our death and resurrection by him to newness of life. Wherefore,
he that eateth and believeth not, and he that is baptized, and is not dead to sin, and walketh
not in newness of life, neither keepeth these ordinances nor pleaseth God. Now to be dead to
sin, is to be dead to those things forbidden in the moral law. For sin is the transgression
of that, and it availeth not to vaunt that I am a saint and under this or that significative
ordinance, if I live in' the transgression of the law.'(1 John 3:4) For I am convicted of the
law as a transgressor, and so concluded to be one that loveth not Christ, though I make a noise
of my obedience to Christ, and of my partaking of his significative ordinances. The Jews of
old made a great noise with their significative ordinances, while they lived in the breach
of the moral law, but their practice of significative ordinances could not save them from the
judgment and displeasure of their God. They could frequent the temple, keep their feasts, slay
their sacrifices, and be mighty apt about all their significative things. But they loved idols,
and lived in the breach of the second table of the law: wherefore God cast them out of his
presence: hark what the prophet saith of them, (Amos 4:4) 'Come to Bethel, and transgress;
at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes
after three years: and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish
the free-will offerings: for this liketh you, 0 ye children of Israel, saith the Lord God.'
Thus, as I said, the hypocrite gives us the slip; for when he heareth that love is in the keeping
of the commandments of God, then he betakes him to the more external parts of worship, and
neglecteth the more weighty matters to the provoking of the God of Israel.

Second, As love to God is shewed by keeping of his commandments; so love to my neighbour, is
the keeping of the commandments of God likewise.

Thus then we must learn to love one another. He that keepeth God's commandment, doth to his
brother what is right, for that is God's commandment. Further, he that keepeth God's commandment
sheweth his brother what he must do to honour the Christ that he professeth, aright: therefore,
he that keeps the commandment, loves his brother. Yea, the keeping of the commandment is loving
the brethren.

But if all love, which we pretend to have one to another, were tried by this one text, how
much of that that we call so, would be found to be nothing less? Preposterous are our spirits
in all things, nor can they be guided right, but by the word and Spirit of God; the which,
the good Lord grant unto us plentifully, that we may do that which is well pleasing in his
sight, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Yea, and that there may, by them, be wrought sound repentance
in us for all that hath been done by us amiss, lest he give 'Jacob to the spoil, and Israel
to the robbers;' for that they have sinned against him by not walking in his ways, and by not
being obedient to his law. (Isa. 42:24)

Let me add, lest God doth not only punish us in the sight, and by the hand of the wicked; but
embolden them to say, it was God that set them on; yea, lest they make those sins of ours,
which we have not repented of, not only their bye-word against us to after generations, but
the argument, one to another, of their justification for all the evil that they shall be suffered
to do unto us: saying, when men shall ask them, 'Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this
land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?' (Deut. 29:24; 1 Kings 9:8; Jer. (2 Tim. 4:5;
Eph. 4:11) And he with the rest of those under his circumstances was to go with the apostles
hither and thither, to be disposed of by them as they saw need, for the further edification
of those who by the apostolical ministry were converted to the faith: and hence it is, that
Titus was left at Crete, and that this Timothy was left at Ephesus. (1 Tim. 1:3) For they were
to do a work for Christ in the world, which the apostles were to begin, and leave upon their
hands to finish. Now when the apostles departed from places, and had left these evangelists
in their stead, usually there did arise some bad spirits among those people, where these were
left for the furtherance of the faith. This is manifest by both the epistles to Timothy, and
also by that to Titus: wherefore Paul, upon whom these two evangelists waited for the fulfilling
of their ministry, writeth unto them while they abode where he left them, concerning those
turbulent spirits which they met with, and to teach them how yet further they ought to behave
themselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground
of truth. And to this purpose he gives them, severally, divers instructions, as the judicious
reader may easily understand, by which he encourageth them to the prosecution of that service
which for Christ they had to do for those people where he had left them, and also instructeth
them how to carry it towards their disturbers, which last he doth, not only doctrinally, but
also by shewing them, by his example and practice, what he would have them do.

This done, he laboureth to comfort Timothy with the remembrance of the steadfastness of God's
eternal decree of election, because grounded on his foreknowledge; saying, though Hymeneus
and Philetus have erred from the faith, and, by their fall, have overthrown the faith of some,
'Yet the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are
his.' Now lest this last hint should still encourage some to be remiss and carnally secure,
and foolish, as I suppose this doctrine abused, had encouraged them to be before; therefore
the apostle immediately conjoineth to it this exhortation; 'And, let every one that nameth;
the name of Christ depart from iniquity.' Two truths strangely, but necessarily joined together,
because so apt to be severed by the children of men; for many, under the pretence of their
being elected, neglect to pursue holiness; and many of them again that pretend to be for holiness,
quite exclude the doctrine and motives that election gives thereto. Wherefore the apostle,
that he might set men's notions as to these things right, he joins these two together, signifying
thereby, that as electing love doth instate a man in the blessing of eternal life; so holiness
is the path thereto; and, that he that refuseth to depart from iniquity shall be dammed; notwithstanding
he may think himself secured from hell by the act of God's electing love. For election designeth
men not only to eternal glory, but to holiness of life, a means, thereto. (Eph. 1:4, 5) And
the manner of this connection of truth is the more to be noted by us, because the apostle seems
to conjoin[2] them, in an holy heat of spirit, saying, 'The foundation of God standeth sure,
having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.' And, 'let every one that shall but so
much as name the name of Christ, depart from iniquity;' or, as who should say, God will be
revenged upon them for all, or, notwithstanding, they appropriate unto themselves the benefits
of election.

In the text we have, FIRST, An exhortation. SECOND, The extension of that exhortation. The
exhortation is, That men depart from iniquity. The extension of it is, to them, all of them,
every one of them that name the name of Christ. 'And let every one that nameth the name of
Christ, depart from iniquity.'

[FIRST, THE EXHORTATION--THAT MEN DEPART FROM INIQUITY]

In the exhortation there are several things to be taken notice of, because insinuated by the
apostle. The first is, that iniquity is a very dangerous and hurtful thing, as to the souls
of sinners in general; so to them that name the name of Christ.

First, Iniquity is a very dangerous and hurtful thing to men in general; for it is that which
did captivate the world at the beginning, and that made it a bond-slave to the devil. It has
also done great hurt to mankind ever since. To instance a few things:

1. It is that which hath stupefied and besotted the powers of men's souls, and made them even
next to a beast and brute in all matters supernatural heavenly. (2 Peter 2:12) For as the beast
minds nothing but his lusts and his belly, by nature, so man minds nothing but things earthly,
sensual, and devilish, by reason of iniquity.

2. It has blinded and darkened the powers of the soul, so that it can neither see where it
is, nor which is the way out of this besotted condition. (Eph. 4:18)

3. It has hardened the heart against God, and against all admonition and counsel in the things
of the gospel of Christ. (Rom. 2:5)

4. It has alienated the will, the mind, and affections, from the choice of the things that
should save it, and wrought them over to an hearty delight in those things that naturally tend
to drown it in perdition and destruction. (Col. 1:21)

5. It has made man odious in God's eyes, it has provoked the justice of God against him, and
made him obnoxious to hell-fire. (Ezek. 16:5)

6. Yea, it so holds him, so binds him, so reserves him to this, that not he himself, nor yet
all the angels of heaven, can deliver him from this deplorable condition. (Prov. 5:22)

7. To say nothing of their pleasure and delight that it makes him take in that way to hell
in which he walketh. (Isa. 66:3; Prov. 7:22, 23) Never went fat ox so gamesomely to the shambles,
nor fool so merrily to the correction of the stocks, nor silly bird so wantonly to the hidden
net, as iniquity makes men go down her steps to the pit of hell and damnation. O it is amazing,
it is astonishing to consider what hurt sin hath done to man, and into how many dangers it
has brought him; but let these few hints at this time suffice as to this. I will now speak
a word to the other particular, namely,

Second, That as iniquity is dangerous and hurtful to the souls of men in general, so it is
to them that name the name of Christ. As to the so and so naming of him, to that I shall speak
by and by, but at this time take it thus: That religiously name his name. And I say iniquity
is hurtful to them.

1. It plucks many a one of them from Christ and the religious profession of him. I have even
seen, that men who have devoutly and religiously professed Jesus Christ, have been prevailed
withal, by iniquity, to cast him and the profession of his name quite off, and to turn their
backs upon him. 'Israel,' saith the prophet, 'hath cast off the thing that is good.' (Hosea
8:3) But why? 'Of their silver and their gold have they made them idols.' The sin of idolatry
threw their hearts from God; their love to that iniquity made them turn their backs upon him.
Wherefore God complains, that of forwardness to their iniquity, and through the prevalence
thereof, they had cast him behind their back. (Ezek. 23:35)

2. As it plucks many a professor from Christ, so it keeps many a one from an effectual closing
with him. How many are there that religiously profess and make mention of the name of Christ,
that yet of love to, and by the interest that iniquity hath in their affections, never close
with him unto salvation, but are like to them, of whom you read in Paul to Timothy, that they
are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. (2 Tim. 3:1-7)

3. And concerning those that have indeed come to him, and that have effectually closed with
him, and that name his name to good purpose; yet how hath iniquity hurt and abused many of
them. (1.) It has prevailed with God to hide his face from them, a thing more bitter than death.
(2.) It has prevailed with God to chastise, and to afflict them sorely, a thing in which he
taketh no pleasure. (Lam 3:33) (3.) It has provoked God to give them over to the hand of the
enemy, and to deliver them to the tormentors. (Jer. 12:7; Matt. 18:34) (4.) It hath brought
them to question their interest in Christ, and whether they ever had grace in their souls.
(Psa. 31:22) (5.) And for those that have yet believed they were in his favour, this iniquity
hath driven them to fear that God would cast them away, and take all his good things from them.
(Psa. 51)

Yea, he that would know the hurt that iniquity hath done to them that name the name of Christ,
let him consider the cries, the sighs, the tears, the bemoanings, the bewailings, the lamentations,
the sorrows, the confessions, the repentings and griefs wherewith they have been attended,
while they have complained that they have been put in the stocks, laid in the dungeon, had
their bones broken, suffered the terrors of God, been distressed almost to distraction, and
have been fed with gravel, gall, wormwood, and with the water of astonishment, for days, yea,
years together. (Job 13:27; Psa. 6:6; Psa. 31:9, 10; Psa. 38:8; Psa. 60:3; Psa. 88; Psa. 116:3;
Jer. 8:14; Jer. 23:15; Jer. 31:18; Lam. 3:4, 16; Ezek. 4:16; 2 Cor. 12:21) By all which, and
many more which might be mentioned, it appears that iniquity is a dangerous and hurtful thing.

[SECOND, THE EXTENSION OF THE EXHORTATION--TO EVERY ONE THAT NAMETH THE NAME OF CHRIST.]

But I proceed, and come in the next place to the extension of the exhortation, namely, that
it reacheth to all those that name the name of Christ. 'And let every one that nameth the name
of Christ depart from iniquity.'

To handle this a little, and to shew you what the apostle here means by naming of the name
of Christ: he meaneth not an irreligious naming of that worthy name, nor those that name it
irreligiously. This is evident, because he passeth by their manner of naming of it without
the least reproof, the which he would not have done had the fault been in their manner of naming
of the name of Christ. Now I say, if he intendeth not those that name the name of Christ irreligiously,
then, though the exhortation, 'let every one,' seems to extend itself to all, and all manner
of persons, that any ways name the name of Christ, yet it is limited by this, to wit, that
rightly, religiously, or according to the way of the professors of Christ, name his worthy
name. And it must needs be so taken, and that for these reasons:

First, For that, as I said before, the apostle taketh no notice of their manner of naming of
his name, so as to reprove any indecency or unseemliness in their naming of him; wherefore
he alloweth of the manner of their naming of him.

Secondly, because the apostle's design in this exhortation was, and is, that the naming of
the name of Christ might be accompanied with such a life of holiness as might put an additional
lustre upon that name whenever named in a religious way; but this cannot be applied to every
manner of naming the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. For if a man shall name the name of Christ
unduly, or irreligiously, though he shall never so much therewithal depart from iniquity, and
be circumspect to the utmost in all civility and morality, yet he answers not the apostle's
end, which he seeks by this his exhortation. For,

1. Suppose a man should name the name of Christ vainly, idly, in vain mirth, wantonness, false
or vain swearing, or the like, and shall back this, his manner of naming the name of Christ,
with all manner of justness and uprightness of life, would this answer the apostle's end in
this his exhortation? Verily no; for this manner of naming the name is worthy reprehension;
'Thou shalt not take my name in vain,' or vainly make use thereof: and moral goodness attending
the so-naming of the name of Christ will do more hurt than good. (Ex. 20)

2. There is a reproachful and scandalous naming of the name of Christ, such as the Jews and
Pharisees did accustom themselves unto, as to call him Jesus, the deceiver; and Christ, in
a way of scorn and contempt. Nor were these men quite destitute of that which put a lustre
upon their opinions; for, said the Lord Christ himself unto them, 'Ye indeed appear beautiful
outward.' (Matt. 23:27)

3. There is such a naming of the name of Christ as to make it a cloak for false and dangerous
errors: that men, by the use of that name, and the putting of it upon such errors and delusions,
may put off their errors to others the better. 'Many shall come in my name, to wit, with their
delusions, presenting them, in my name, to the world, and shall put them off, in my name, to
the destruction of the soul. (Matt. 24:5) Now, can any imagine that the apostle should extend
his exhortation to such, that they, thus continuing to name the name of Christ, should depart
from iniquity. To what end should such be comprehended in this of exhortation of his? to no
purpose at all: for the more an erroneous person, or a deceiver of souls, shall back his errors
with a life that is morally good, the more mischievous, dangerous, and damnable is that man
and his delusions; wherefore such a one is not concerned in this exhortation.

4. There is a naming of the name of Christ magically, and after the manner of exorcism, or,
conjuration; as we read in the Acts of the apostles. vagabond Jews, the exorcists, there say,
'We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.' (Acts 19:13-15) Thus they called over them that
had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus. But what if these should clothe this, their devilish
art, and devilish way, of using or naming of the name of the Lord Jesus, with departing from
iniquity, so as to commend their whole life to by-standers, for such: as is morally good: what
advantage would Christ, or Paul, or the gospel, get thereby? verily none at all; but rather
damage and reproach, as will soon appear to any man's reason, if it be considered that goodness
of life, joined to badness of principles is like the devil clothed in white, or Satan transformed
into an angel of light. And Paul was grieved in his spirit, when the wench that had a spirit
of divination did acknowledge him to be the servant of the most high God, for he knew it would
nothing further, or help forward, the Lord's design, but be rather an hinderance thereto. For
when witches and devils come once to commend, or make use of the name of Christ, Christ and
Paul like it not; therefore Paul's exhortation, which here are presented with by the text,
is not extended to any of the four sorts aforenamed, but,

Third, To those upon whom his name is called, they should depart from iniquity. I say those
whom God has so far dignified, as to put the name of Christ upon them. (Acts 15:17) And I will
add, that apply that name to themselves. And the reason is, because God is now concerned. (ch.
11:26) God has changed thy name from Pagan to Christian, and thou choosest to call thyself
by that name, saying, 'I belong to Christ.' Now thou must depart from iniquity, for that notice
is taken of thee, both by heaven and earth, that thou art become a disciple, and 'let every
one that' so 'nameth the name of Christ,' or that nameth it, being himself by God and himself
put under such circumstances as these, 'depart from iniquity.' (1 Peter 4:16)

Fourthly, It is spoken to those that name the name of Christ either in the public or private
worship of God, being themselves professed worshippers of him; and the reason is, for that
the ordinances, as well as the name of God, is holy, and 'he will be sanctified in them that
come nigh him.' (Lev. 10:3) He therefore that approacheth the presence of Christ in prayer,
or any other divine appointment, must take heed of regarding 'iniquity in his heart.' (Psa.
66:18) Else the Lord will stop his ears to his prayers, and will shut his eyes, and not take
notice of such kind of worship or worshippers.

Fifthly, Those that the apostle in this place exhorts to depart from iniquity are such as have
taken unto themselves the boldness to say, that they are in him, abide in him, and consequently
are made partakers of the benefits that are in him. 'He that saith he abideth in him, ought
himself also to walk, even as he walked.' (1 John 2:6) And the reason is, because Christ is
a fruitful root, and a free conveyer of sap into the branches; hence it is written, that 'the
trees of the Lord are full of sap.' (Psa. 104:16) So then, he that nameth the name of Christ
by way of applying to himself his benefits, and as counting that he is found of God in him,
and so abideth, ought himself to walk even as he walked, that he may give proof of what he
saith to be true, by bearing forth before men that similitude of righteousness that is in his
root and stem: for such as the stock or tree is, such let the branches be, but that cannot
be known but by the fruit: 'ye shall know them by their fruit.' (Matt. 7:16) So then, he that
thus shall name the name of Christ, let him depart from iniquity: yea, let every such man do so.

Sixthly, This exhortation is spoken to them that name Christ as their Sovereign Lord and King:
let them 'depart from iniquity.' 'The Lord is our judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord
is our King; he will save us.' (Isa. 33:22) [These] are great words; and as they cannot be
spoken by every one, so they ought not to be spoken lightly by them that can. Nor may he that
claims so high a privilege be but obedient, submissive, apt to learn, conscientiously to put
in practice what he hath learnt of his Judge, his Lawgiver, and his King. Lest when some shall
hear him say that Christ, by name, is his Lawgiver and his King, and shall yet observe him
to do things evil, and to walk in ways that are not good, they shall think evil, and speak
so of his King; saying, Learnt you this of Christ your King? or doth your King countenance
you in ways that are so bad? or, do you by thus and thus doing submit to the laws of your king?
yea, your King, his name and gospel shall bear the burden of the evil, together with the shame
thereof, if thou that namest the name of Christ shalt not depart from iniquity.

Lastly, Whatever man he be that by his naming of the name of Christ shall intimate that he
hath any reverence of love to, or delight in that Christ, whose name he nameth, that man should
depart from iniquity, not only for the reasons that are above mentioned, but for those that
may be named afterwards.

But having thus far opened the word, and shewed who and what manner of man the apostle had
in his eye, in this his exhortation, I shall come, in the next place, to make some observations
upon the text. As,

[OBSERVATION FIRST.]

That it is incident to men to name the name of Christ religiously, that is, rightly as to words
and nations, and not to 'depart from iniquity.' This was the occasion of this exhortation,
for Paul saw that there were some that did so; to wit, that named the name of Christ well,
as to words, but did not depart from iniquity. Some such he also I found among them at Corinth,
which made him say, 'Awake to righteousness, and sin not.' (1 Cor. 15:34) He found such at
Ephesus, and cries out to them most earnestly, saying, 'Awake thou that sleepest, and arise
from the dead.' (Eph.

In my discourse upon this subject, I must endeavour to shew you two things. FIRST, What Paul
means when he saith, 'depart from iniquity.' SECONDLY, Why some, that as to words, rightly
name the name of Christ, do not 'depart from iniquity.'

The first of those doth need some explanation, because in some sense even the best of saints
cannot depart from sin, or iniquity.

1. Because as to the being of it, it is seated and rooted in their flesh, and hath its dwelling
there. Yea, it hath, and so will have an abiding there, so long as man is on this side that
state of perfection, which is not to be enjoyed while we are in the flesh: 'for in me, that
is, in my flesh,' sin dwells, (Rom. 7:18) nor doth any thing else but sin dwell there: 'for
in me, that is, in my flesh, said Paul, 'dwelleth no good thing:' therefore the apostle must
not be understood as if he intended to insinuate that there was a possibility that the nature
and being of sin could be plucked up by the roots, and so cast clean away from us, as to the
very nature thereof. No, that will abide with us, for it hath its dwelling in us.

2. And as they cannot depart from the nature, of it as such, that is, as they cannot be rid
of the being of sin, so neither can they depart from the motions and stirrings of sin, no more
than they can stir from the motions or stirrings of their natural senses, or of their natural
reason: the motions of sin, which Paul also calls the lusts thereof, will be where the nature
and being of sin is, because it is not dead; for that which liveth, what manner of life soever
it hath, will have motion according to the manner of life which it hath; and sin being one
of the most quick and brisk things that are, it will also have its motions and lusts accordingly.
Hence Paul says, it lusts, and will lust, where it is and dwells; though the very Spirit of
God and the utmost diligence of a Christian be also there to oppose it. (Rom. 6:12; Gal. 5:17)

3. Again, as the being and motions of sin will be with us, so also will it in its endeavours.
It will endeavour to overcome us, and to make us captives to itself and to Satan; and these
endeavours will be with us. (Eph. 6:11, 12; 2 Cor. 10:5; Heb. 12:4) Nor can we so depart from
iniquity, as to be utterly rid of all sense and feeling of what endeavours there are in sin
and iniquity to be master and lord, and reign. Sin will endeavour to defile the mind, to defile
the conscience, to defile the life and conversation; and this endeavour, as endeavour, we cannot
depart from; that is, cause that it should not be in our flesh; for there it will be, since
sin in its being is there.

4. As the being, motions, and endeavours of sin will still abide in our flesh, so consequently
will its polluting fumes be upon us; nor doth the apostle mean, when he bids us depart from
iniquity, that we should think that we can so be, or so do, in this life, as that our being
or doing should not smell of the strong scent of sin. Engineering there was tell under Province

 (Psa 119:136; 1 Col 13:5) (2.) Where no love is, men cannot deny themselves
of that which otherwise they might lawfully do, lest the weak should fall, and the world be
destroyed. It is a common thing to find men partial in God's law, setting much by small things,
and neglecting the weightier matters, paying tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and neglecting
the weightier matters. These turn the tables of God's book upside down; making little laws
of great ones; and great ones of little ones; counting half an hour's bodily service better
than a moral life. Love! love is gone out of the country; love to the doctrine of the first
table, love to the doctrine of the second table. O how many professors, in God's eyes, are
accounted of no more than sounding brass, for want of this ornament, love! (1 Cor 13)

To speak nothing of the first table, where is he that hath his love manifested by the second?
where are they that feed the hungry and clothe the naked, and send portions to them, for whom
nothing is prepared? Where is Paul that would not eat meat while the world standeth, lest he
made his brother offend? (1 Cor 8:13) Where is Dorcas, with her garments she used to make for
the widow, and for the fatherless? (Acts 9:36-39) Yea, where is that rich man that, to his
power, durst say as Job does? as recorded in Job 30:25; 31:13,32. They want love, and therefore
cannot depart from iniquity.[4]

4. [They want HOPE.] Hope is another of those great and principal graces, which the Holy Ghost
worketh in the heart, and without which, let a man be never so high in profession, and so open
in naming the name of Christ, he cannot depart from iniquity. As was said before of faith,
so we say now of hope. 'And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as
he is pure.' (1 John 3:3) Here is that excellent office, or rather effect of hope made manifest,
it purifieth, it cleanseth a man; it makes him make the Lord Jesus his example, as well as
his Saviour. He purifieth himself even as he is pure; to wit, in soul, in body, in spirit,
in life and conversation. Hope of life, eternal by Christ, makes a man purify himself in obeying
the truth through the Spirit. Hope to be with Christ hereafter, will make me strive to believe
him here. Hope of being with angels then, will make a man strive to live like an angel here.
Is not this now far off from some professors in the world? Are they purified, are they clean
that name the name of Christ? are they weaned from that milk, and drawn from the breasts? No,
nor their profession is not attended with grace; they name the name of Christ; well, but they
do not depart from iniquity. Let a man believe a lie, and according to the reality of his belief,
such will his obedience be; let a man hope for that for which he hath no ground to hope, yet
his hope will work with him according to the power thereof; and yet we have a generation of
men that profess the blessed gospel, which yieldeth the most substantial ground for faith and
hope; yea, we have a company of men that will be naming the name of Christ, which is the sweetest,
the most taking, and desirable name that is named among the sons of men, and for all that,
this gospel, this worthy name, nor yet their naming of it, doth make them depart from iniquity.
But what's the reason? why, they have taken up a profession, but want the grace of Christ;
the faith, the repentance, the love and hope of the gospel. No marvel then, if they abide among
the wooden sort of professors: no marvel then, though the iniquity of their heels still follows
them, and that it droppeth from them wherever they go. But so much for the first reason, why
men do name the name of Christ and yet do not depart from iniquity.

Second, The second reason, why some that name the name of Christ, depart not from iniquity,
is, for that, though they rest not in bare notions, as those forementioned, yet they take up
as they, short of the saving grace of God. There are bare notions, there are common workings,
and there is a work that is saving, and that will do the soul good to eternity.

1. There are bare notions, and they that have them are such unto whom the gospel comes IN WORD
ONLY. (1 Thess 1:5; 1 Cor 4:19,20) Such whose religion stands in word only, and is not attended
with a power suitable; that is, there goeth not along with the word, a power sufficient to
subdue, and work over the heart to a cordial and gracious close with that word that comes to
them. Yet such is the noise and sound of the word, that they are willing to become professors
thereof; there is some kind of musicalness in it, especially when well handled and fingered
by a skilful preacher. And lo, saith God unto such preachers, when their auditory is made up
of such kind of hearers, 'And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely song,' or as one that
sings a song of loves, 'of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument:
for they hear thy words but they do them not.' (Eze. 33:30-32)

2. But then, besides these, there is another sort, and they go further than these. For to them
the word came, not in word only, but also in POWER: though not in that or in such a power as
is sufficient absolutely against all attempts whatsoever to bring the soul to glory. Of these
we read in several places; to wit, that they have tasted of the powers of the world to come;
but not so as to bring them safe to glory. Yet thus far they go. (1.) They attain light or
illumination, to see much of their state by nature with. (Heb 6:4) (2.) This light standeth
not in bare speculation, but lets fall upon the conscience convincing arguments to the bowing
and humbling of the spirit. For the word will be sweet unto them. Christ, the gift of God,
will be relished by them. (Heb 6:4,5) The powers of the world to come will be in them. Some
workings of the Holy Ghost will be in them. And joy, which is as oil to the wheels, will be
with their souls. (Luke 8:13)

Thus, I say, it is with some professors, who yet cannot be said to depart from iniquity, that
is, for all ado, because the things that now are upon them, abide with them but awhile. 'For
awhile they believe: they rejoice in the light for a season.' (Luke 8:13, John 5:35, 2 Peter
2:21) So they clean escape from them, who live in error for a little, or awhile; and after
that return to their old course, and are again entangled with their iniquities and overcome.
This is called, 'A turning with the dog to his own vomit again, and with the sow that was washed,
to her wallowing in the mire.' And some of these are set forth by this and such like sayings,
'When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest,
and finding none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when
he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself
seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last
state of that man is worse than the first.' (Matt 12:44,45)

Now the causes of this declension, returning, or falling away again into iniquity, are many.

First [Cause of falling away.] One is for that this work, this work of power that they have
been made partakers of, has not been thorough enough upon all the powers of their souls. Their
understandings, their judgments and consciences have been dealt with, but the power of God
has not been upon their wills and minds, and affections, rightly to subdue them to the grace
of the gospel. (Psa. 110:3) Indeed there seems to be subjection of the will, and an overruling
of the mind, and affections also, else they could not for a time lay aside their iniquity,
come off from the pollutions of the world, and for a season rejoice in the world and be pleased
with the light thereof. But we may consider, that this may be, not for that a sound work of
God hath passed upon these powers of the soul, but that rather this was by reason of those
reflex acts, that the understanding now enlightened, the judgment now informed, and the conscience
now convinced, had upon these other powers of the soul. And I the rather think it so, because
willingness, mindfulness of, and affection for, this gospel, lasted no longer than the light
shined in their understandings, or than the things were relished by their judgment and conscience.
So that when the light of their candle went out, and when the taste of this sugar-plum was
out of their mouth, their wills and affections, not being possessed with the fear of God, they
returned again to their course, and went away as before with iniquity.

Nor do I by anything here discoursed, lay blame or fault at the door of God. For,

1. He is a free agent to do what he pleaseth, and may, if he please, refuse to give anything,
or if he gives something, why may he not give what he pleases also? He may give special grace
to one, and that which is not so to another: he may open Balaam's eyes, (Num. 24:3) and open
Lydia'a heart; (Acts 16:14) he may give some but a taste, and cause some to eat abundantly.
(Heb. 6; Songs 5:1) He may suffer some to fall away, and keep others, by his power, through
faith unto salvation.

2. Besides, God's withdrawing, to wit, of those common workings, if they were withdrawn without,
a cause given--which yet I question--yet why may they not be withdrawn from these, as well
as from his own peculiar ones. He knows but little, that doth not know that God ofttimes hides
his face from his own, and also withdraws from them the light and great influences of the Holy
Ghost: and turns them over, at least in their own apprehensions, to the ungodly, and to fallen
angels for their chastisement, or trial; or instruction, &c.

3. And why may not God, since these rebels had such working with them, as that their minds,
by their understanding, their will and affections; by their judgment and consciences were somewhat
taken and allured, cause a withdrawing of these for trial, and to see if they would cry after
him to return.

But we will let these things pass, and call you again to remembrance of what is in hand: we
are now shewing that there be them that name the name of Christ, 'that yet depart not from
iniquity,' and in shewing the cause of their not so doing, one was for that the gospel came
to them in word only; and the other was, for that though it came to others in power, yet not
in power, or in that power, that effectually keepeth some to salvation. Upon this second reason
I now am, and am shewing how it comes to pass that they that are under the power of the things
that we have afore discoursed, should notwithstanding that, return to their vomit again. One
cause of this declension, or going back to iniquity, I have just now touched upon, and we have
some more behind.

Second [Cause of falling away.] Therefore such persons upon the withdrawing of those influences
that at present are mighty upon them, do forthwith; forget, both what they had, and what work
it made upon them. Straightway they forget what manner of men they were. It is said of Israel,
they sang his praises, they soon forgot his word. So these they forget.

1. They forget what light and what conviction they had.

2. They forget what sorrow for sin they had.

3. They forget what tastes of Christ and his word they had.

4. They forget what joy and comfort they had.

5. They forget how fair for heaven they were.

6. And they forget how cleansed once they were.

'They have forgotten that they were purged from their old sins.' (2 Peter 1:9) Now forgetfulness
makes things that are past as nothing; and if so, then it can lay no obligations upon the mind,
to engage it to the delight of them, and to the enjoying of them, no not in the thoughts of
them, as if they were remembered by us. Forgetfulness is a very dangerous thing: it makes preaching
vain, profession vain, faith vain, and all to no purpose. (1 Cor. 15:1, 2) Such profession
is but a dream, and the professors but as dreamers: all vanishes in the morning. This made
Paul so caution the Corinthians, that they forgot not the preaching; and the author to the
Hebrews, so earnestly calls them, in their back-sliding, back to the remembrance of former
days, and to the recollecting of what it was that then had made them so willingly endure their
great fight of affliction. (Heb. And therefore you shall find, that the recovering of a backslider
usually begins at the remembrance of former things. 'Remember therefore from whence thou art
fallen, and repent, and do the first works.' (Rev. 2:5)

It is marvellous to see how some men are captivated with this forgetfulness. Those that sometimes
have prayed, cried, groaned, and sighed, for eternal life; those that sometimes thought no
pains too much, no way too far, no hazards too great to run, for eternal life; those who sometimes
were captivated with the word, and with the comforts and joy thereof, and that, had it been
possible, could have pulled out their eyes, and have given them to a gospel minister, so dear
and sweet were the good tidings which they brought to such. (Gen. 4:14, 15) I say it is marvellous
to see how such men are captivated with the forgetfulness of this. They are as if they never
had been those men; they are as if they had never had such things; or, as if they never had
thought about them. Yea, they are strange, and carry it strangely to all those that still are
under the power of that word, and of that mighty band by which sometimes themselves were guided.
They look as if they were blasted, withered, cast out, and dried to powder, and now fit for
nothing but to be cast into the fire, and burned. (John 15:6) The godliness from which they
are departed, and the iniquity unto which again they have joined themselves, has so altered,
so metamorphosed and changed their heart, and mind, and ways. This therefore as the second
thing which shews why some that have been under something of the power of things,[5] are again
with iniquity entangled and overcome.

Third [Cause of falling away.] Another thing that makes these enlightened ones, that they continue
not to depart from iniquity, is the persecution that always attends the word: for persecution
always attends the word, that of the tongue, or that of the sword. Now these men that were
once enlightened, though they cannot remember what they were themselves, yet Satan helps them
to think that their neighbours remember what they were: and having now lost the savour, the
sense of what they once had, and sinned away that Spirit that brought it to them, they grow
weak; yea are above all men the most unable to stand up, to abide the shock and trial, that
for their profession is coming upon them. Wherefore, by and by they are offended; to wit, with
their own profession, and call themselves an hundred fools, for being so heedless, so witless,
and unwary, to mind God's holy things in such a time and day. (Matt. 4:16, 17; Luke 8:13) Then
they bethink with themselves, how to make an honourable retreat, which they suppose they usually
do, by finding fault, first with their own unadvisedness, and of the over-persuasiveness of
others; they also now begin to say farewell conscience, yea, God and heaven and all, and join
in confederacy with the world again. Thus are they in fear, where no fear is; and the sound
of a shaken leaf doth chase them. And there are four things that are the cause of this.

1. For that not withstanding the former power that attended the word to their hearts, their
hearts did still abide as hard as a rock, there was no true and sound breaking, nor softening
in that; wherefore there the word wanted depth of earth, as our Lord is pleased to call it;
and anon when the sun was up, that which remained was presently scorched, and so withered away.

2. Notwithstanding what they had sometimes enjoyed, yet the grace of the fear of God was wanting
in them. (Eccl. 7:16-18) So wanting that, what should hinder but that they should return to
go as they came, and leave Christ, the gospel, and the people of God to shift as well as they
can for themselves.

3. All that they enjoyed did not estrange their hearts from their lusts, though when they were
in the power of things, they were deader to them than formerly; I say than formerly. (Psa.
78:30, 36, 37) And it is even with such, as with them, who are for a time taken off from what
yet they love, by some new employ in which they are engaged. Saul went out to look for David
to kill him, but when he came at Naioth, in Ramah, the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
prophesied. (1 Sam. 19:18, 24) But this lasted but for a while. Saul soon returned to his old
envy against the holy man again.

4. It comes upon them even of judgment and wrath, for since they so soon give way to sin, and
forget, God suffereth them to fall into the fear of men, and to force their hearts to comply
with bad things,--even as Judas and Demas did,--till they are swallowed up of that gulph, into
which the ungodly descend. Yea, he can make a way for his anger to overtake them that have
made a way, by the deceits of their hearts, to go a-whoring from under him.

And these are the causes why those that were once enlightened, and have tasted the good word
of God, and the powers of the world to come, return with the dog to his own vomit again; and
so, though they have or do name the name of Christ, yet depart not from iniquity.

Third, A third reason, why they that name the name of Christ do not depart from iniquity, may
be, because GRACE IS WEAK and CORRUPTION STRONG. I speak now of them that are truly gracious;
for as those that never had nothing but notion, did never at all depart from iniquity: and
as those that never had saving grace, though common workings were with them, do but a little
depart from iniquity; so those that yet have the grace of God in them, in truth, do not, as
they should, depart from iniquity; wherefore the exhortation is as much to them as it is to
any body else; 'and let them that name the name of Christ,' with gracious lips, 'depart from
iniquity.' For though there is a great difference betwixt these and the two sorts that I mentioned
before,--these having the true principles of holiness in them, but the other nothing thereof,--yet
they, even they, also have need of this exhortation; for they do not, as they should, 'depart
from iniquity.' Their graces, as I said, are weak, and that is the reason thereof.

That these do not depart from iniquity, as they should, is clear.

1. For that their highest acts of holiness are tainted therewith, and made imperfect thereby.
(Isa. 64:6; Psa. 143:2; Heb. 12:15; Matt. 6:23) This is manifest, because they still are afraid
to shew themselves before God in their own works, and because they betake them for acceptation
with God, to the priestly office of Christ, and pray by him, 'forgive us our trespasses.'

2. This is clear also, because we are, while in this world, nowhere by the word said to have
attained to the mark and point of absolute perfection; but are bid to grow, to follow on, to
press forward, and to perfect holiness in the fear of God. (2 Peter 3:18; Heb. 6:12; Phil.
3:12-14; 2 Cor. 7:1) Yea, the best of us all, even the apostles and prophets, have not only
made it manifest by their imperfections, that as yet they have not departed from iniquity as
they should; but they have confessed, and denied not, that they were yet in the pursuit of
righteousness, and had not already attained.

3. This is clear also, for that the righteousness, by the which the best of saints are justified
in the sight of God, is a righteousness of another, not their own; the righteousness of another
man, for that there is not any upon earth that doth good and sins not. And what need we pray,
'forgive us our trespasses,' approach God in the perfections of another, and be bid 'to perfect
holiness,' if we had already attained, or were already perfect, or were so departed from iniquity
as we should.

4. Alas, the complaints of God concerning this matter, doth sufficiently testify the truth
of what I say. When God came to his people in Egypt, and bid them forsake the idols of Egypt,
they did not. Well, he saved them out of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness, and said
to them there, Obey my laws, and my commandments; but the house of Israel rebelled against
me in the wilderness, they walked not in my statutes, they despised my judgments. Well, then
he had them from the wilderness to Canaan, and then said to them, Keep my laws. (Eze. 20) But
when he had brought them into the land, then they also polluted themselves, and sinned, against
him as before. Again, when God brought them out of captivity, both they, and every thing that
they did, was unclean. (Hag. 2:14)

To be short, what says Paul in the seventh to the Romans? what says James in the third chapter
of his epistle? (ch. 3:2) And what says John in his first epistle, and first chapter? (1 John
1:9) Do they not all confess, though themselves were apostles, and so for grace and gifts beyond
any that breathe in this world, that sin and iniquity was yet with them; and so consequently,
that there was not as yet that departing by them therefrom, as there should. And the reason,
as I have said, is, because grace is weak, weak in the beat and most strong of the saints of
God. Hence the greatest saints use to complain, when much assaulted with corruptions, or attended
with very hard service for God, of their weakness and insufficiency, as to a completeness of
doing the will of God. Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? 10) Some may say, but this
is natural weakness. But I ask, how came nature to be so weak, but through sin? the remains
whereof abiding still upon the best of saints, make them, not withstanding their graces, incapable
to do any thing as they should.

(4.) Paul, a man of men, who had so much grace, revelation of grace and communion with Christ,
that sometimes he knew not whether he was in or out of the body, and yet you find him making
bitter complaint of the weakness of his grace, and of the power of his corruptions. And what
need was there of any of this, if Paul could, as he would, have departed from iniquity? (Rom. 8)

I have instanced in these four men, because as to failings and miscarriages they are as free--by
what the holy record saith--as any four of whose lives you shall read in all the Bible; but
you see that they were too weak to do good and depart from iniquity as they would.

Grace may be said to be weak, either when a lower or less degree thereof is compared with a
higher and greater degree of the same; or it may be said to be weak when, in what degree of
it you will, it shall be engaged by, or engage itself against sin, &c.

There are degrees of grace in the world, some have less, and some bigger measures thereof,
and according to the measure of grace received, so is a Christian capable of action. He that
has little, acts but weakly; he that has much, acts more strongly; and he of the saints that
has most, acteth best of all: but yet none of these three can act so as they should and would,
and, consequently, so depart from iniquity as is their duty. Witness those four that I mentioned
but now, for they are among the first-rate of saints, yet you see what they did, and hear what
they said.

Sin is a mighty tyrant; it is also installed in our flesh, and has moreover that in it which
suiteth with whatever is sensual in us. The flesh relisheth it well, though the spirit of the
Christian is against it.

Sin is an active beast, and will not admit that the soul should attempt to put forth itself
in any good thing, without opposition and contradiction. 'When I should do good evil is present
with me.'[6]

Sin is of a polluting and defiling nature, and what grace soever it toucheth it staineth, and
in staining makes it weaker, than were it not so defiled it would be. Besides, not a grace,
nor an act of grace in the soul can escape untouched.

Unbelief stands ready to annoy faith in the grace, as well as in the act of faith.

Hardness of heart will not let love so affectionately and sympathisingly act as it should.

Sense and reason being polluted will not let hope be so steadfastly fixed upon unseen things
as it should.

Pride will not let us be so humble as we ought, nor self so self denying. Passion often interrupts
our patience, and angry motions our meekness. By these, and more that might be named, it appears
that sin is in us, opposeth our graces, and letteth[7] them from acting as they should; and
because this sin has part of ourself in its possession, therefore though our more noble part
be utterly against it, yet we depart not from it as we should.

God chargeth Moses with rash and unadvised words, and so he doth Job also: Daniel did wear
the name of an idol god, and Paul freely confesseth himself unfirm. (Num. 20:12; Psa. 106:32;
Job 38:2; Job 42:6; Dan. 4:8; Rom. 7:24)

Nor may what hath now been said be applied to those that are weak in faith, and so in every
other grace; for the strongest grace when acted as well as we can, cannot cause that we depart
from iniquity as we should. (l.) Because the strongest grace cannot act without opposition.
(2.) Because we that are the actors are lame, infirm, and made weak by sin that dwells in us.
(3.) Because grace and a state of grace is not that wherein the perfection designed for us
doth lie, for that is in another world. (a.) This is a place to act faith in. (b.) This is
a place to labour and travel in. (c.) This is a place to fight and wrestle in. (d.) This is
a place to be tried in.

And therefore this is no place of perfection, and consequently no place where God's people
can depart from iniquity as they should. Now there is a twofold way of departing from iniquity.
I. One is when the mind is set against it, and withdrawn from the love and liking of it. II.
The other is when the practice of it is shunned by the whole man.

I. The first of these ways, the saints, though they truly do depart from iniquity, yet depart
not from it as they should. (1.) Their understanding sees not the utmost baseness that is in
it. (2.) Their judgment is not informed about the vileness of it to perfection. (3.) The conscience
has not yet been convinced of all the evil that is in it. Then, (a.) How should the soul abhor
it as it should? (b.) How should the desires depart from it with that fervency as they should?
(c.) And the will and affections so turn away from it as they should?

II. Second, As to the shunning of the acts of sin, there we also come wonderful short.

We shun not the sins of others as we should. This is made appear, (1.) For that we shun not
the company of base men as we should. (2.) Nor shun or refuse to imitate them in their evil,
as we should. How easily are good men persuaded to comply with bad men's ways. Yea, Jehoshaphat
himself said to Ahab, that base one: Behold, 'I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my
horses as thy horses.' (1 Kings 22:4) Joseph could learn in Pharaoh's court, to 'swear by Pharaoh's
life.' (Gen. 42:15, 16) Peter also, when dissembling, was in fashion among the people, could
learn to dissemble likewise. (Gal. 2:11-14)

We shun not our own sins or the sine of our own company as we should.

Besides, if I should go about to shew here, how Christians will hide iniquity, as David. (2
Sam. 12:12) How they will excuse it, as did Aaron. (Ex. 32:22-24) How they will plead for it,
as did the men of the city of Joash for Baal. (Jud. 6:29-31) and the like, I might soon make
it abundantly appear, that Christians do not depart from iniquity as they should; and therefore
the exhortation stands; good, and of use to the best of saints on earth, that they and every
of them 'should depart from iniquity.' Yea, the observation also that they do not do it as
they should, doth still stand good against us.

Wherefore, as it is true in those that have nothing but notion, and that it is true in those
that are wrought upon, but not effectually, so it is true upon those that are truly gracious;
observation proves it, fears of damnation prove it, the outcry of the world proves it, and
the confession of the best men proves it.

[OBSERVATION SECOND.]

I come now to another observation with which I will present you, and that is this, namely,
that every one that in way of profession and religion names the name of Christ, 'SHOULD DEPART
from iniquity.' I say, that every one that in a way of profession and religion, 'nameth the
name of Christ, should depart from iniquity.' This truth needs more practice than proof. For
I think there are none that have either scripture or reason by them, but will freely consent
to this.

Nor is there any thing ambiguous in the observation, that we need now to stand upon the explaining
of. For,

What iniquity is, who knows not?

That it cleaves to the best, who knows not?

That it is disgraceful to profession, who knows not? and therefore that it ought to be departed
from, who knows not?

But because the motives in particular may not be so much considered as they ought, and because
it is Satan's design to tempt us to be unholy, and to keep iniquity and the professing man
together; therefore I will in this place spend some arguments upon you that profess, and in
a way of profession do name the name of Christ, that you depart from iniquity; to wit, both
in the inward thought and in the outward practice of it. And those arguments shall be of four
sorts, some respecting Christ, some his Father, some ourselves, and some the world.

First, [Arguments that respect CHRIST.]

First, The Christ, whom you profess, whose name you name, and whose disciples you pretend to
be, is holy. 'Be ye holy, for I am holy,' (1 Peter 1:16) This is natural to our discourse;
for if Christ be holy, and if we profess him, and in professing of him, declare that we are
his disciples, we ought therefore to depart from iniquity, that we may shew the truth of our
profession to the world.

Second, They that thus name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, because this Christ,
whose name we name, is loving. Those that have a loving master, a master that is continually
extending his love unto his servants, should be forward in doing of his will, that thereby
they may shew their sense, and acceptation of the love of their master. Why, this is his will,
'that we depart from iniquity, that we throw sin away; that we fly every appearance of evil.'
(1 Thess. 5:22; Heb. 7:26)

Third, They that thus name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, because of the honour
and reputation of their Lord. It is a disparagement to Christ, that any of his servants, and
that any that name his name, should yet abide by, and continue with, iniquity. 'A son honoureth
his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a Father, where is mine honour? and if I
be a Master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts, unto you, O priests, that despise my
name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?' (Mal. 1:6)

Fourth, They that name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, because of his name,
that his name may not be evil spoken of by men; for our holiness puts a lustre and a beauty
upon the name of Christ, and our not departing from iniquity draws a cloud upon it. Wherefore
we ought to depart from iniquity, that the name of the Lord Jesus may be glorified, and not
reproached through us.

Fifth, They that name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, because of the gospel
of the Lord Jesus Christ. That the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, which they profess, may
not be evil spoken of by our neighbours. The gospel is called holy, therefore let them be holy
that profess it. (2 Peter 2:21) The which they can by no means be, if they depart not from
iniquity. Men cannot serve the designs of the gospel, and their own worldly and fleshly designs.
But they that profess the name of Christ, they should be tender of his gospel, that they keep
that in good esteem and reputation in the world. The which they can by no means do, unless
they depart from iniquity.

Sixth, They that name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, because the very profession
of that name is holy. The profession is an holy profession. Be ye clean that bear the vessels
of the Lord; the vessels, that is, the profession, for by that is as it were carried about
the name and gospel of Jesus Christ. We must therefore lay aside all iniquity, and superfluity
of naughtiness, and do as persons professing godliness, as professing a profession, that Christ
is the priest of, yea the high-priest of 1 Thess. 2:30; Heb. 3:3. It is a reproach to any man
to be but a bungler at his profession, to be but a sloven in his profession. And it is the
honour of a man to be excellent in the managing of his profession. Christians should be excellent
in the management of their profession, and should make that which is good in itself, good to
the church and to the world, by a sweet and cleanly managing of it.

Seventh, They that profess the name of Christ, or that name it religiously, should to their
utmost depart from iniquity, because of the church of Christ which is holy. He that religiously
professeth the name of Christ, has put himself into the church of Christ, though not into a
particular one, yet into the universal one. Now that is holy. What agreement then hath the
temple of God with idols? Ay, or any pillar, or post, or pin, or member of that temple. (2
Cor. 6:16) One black sheep is quickly espied among five hundred white ones, and one mangey
one will soon affect many. 9:18)

Eighth, They that profess the name of Christ, or that name that name religiously, should depart
from iniquity, because of the ordinances of Christ, for they are holy. (Ex. 30:17-31) Men of
old before they went in to meddle with holy things, were to wash their hands and their feet
in a vessel prepared for that purpose. Now since they that name that name religiously do also
meddle with Christ's appointments, they must also wash and be clean; cleanse your hands ye
sinners, if you mean to meddle with Christ in his appointment; wash lest God cut you off for
your not departing from iniquity.

Ninth, They that name the name of Christ religiously should depart from iniquity, because of
Christ's observers. There are many that keep their eye upon Christ, and that watch for an opportunity
to speak against him, even through the sides of those that profess him. 'Behold, this child
is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign that shall be spoken
against.' (Luke 2:34) Some take occasion to speak against him, because of the meanness of his
person; here some again speak against him, because of the plainness of his doctrine; also some
speak against him, because of the meanness of his followers; and some speak against him, because
of the evil deeds of some that profess him. But if he that gives just occasion of offence to
the least of the saints had better be drowned in the sea with a mill-stone about his neck;
what think you shall his judgment be, who, through his mingling of his profession of Christ's
name with a wicked life shall tempt or provoke men to speak against Christ?

SECOND, I come now to those arguments that respect GOD THE FATHER.

First, Then, they that profess the name of Christ should depart from iniquity; because of God
the Father, because God the Father has made Christ to be to us what he is; to wit, the Apostle
and high-priest of our profession. 'He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father
which hath sent him.' (1 Cor. 1:30; John 5:23; 15:8) Nor can the Father be honoured by us,
but by our departing from iniquity. All our talk and profession of Christ, adds no glory to
his Father, who has made him our King, and Priest, and Prophet, if it be not joined to an holy
conversation. Wherefore, if you profess the name of Christ, and would hold the word in hand,
that you have believed in him, depart from iniquity, for the Father's sake that hath sent him.

Second, As it is the Father which hath made Christ to us what he is; so it is the Father who
hath called us to partake of Christ and all his benefits. 'Wherefore we must depart from iniquity
that profess the name of Christ, that we may glorify him for his call.' (1 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:1)
He has called us to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ; that is, to partake of all that
good that is in him, as Mediator, and to be done by him for those that trust in him. Nor had
we ever come out of a cursed and condemned condition, to Christ, for life and blessedness,
but by the call of the Father; 'For it is not of works, but of him that calleth.' (Rom. 9:11)
Now since he has called us to this privilege--even us whom he has called--and left others in
their sins to perish by his judgments, it is meet we should depart from iniquity. (Heb. 3:1;
2 Peter 1:2, 3) Especially since the call by which he called us is heavenly, and holy, and
because he has not only called us to glory, but to virtue.

Third, We that religiously name the name of Christ, should depart from iniquity, because God
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has commanded us to do. Wherefore gird up the loins of
your minds, be sober, and hope to the ene for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
revelation of Jesus Christ. The Father has, therefore, called them to profess his name, that
they might be trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.
Dost thou then profess the name of Christ: bring forth those fruits that become that holy profession,
that you may be called 'trees of righteousness,' and that God may be glorified for and by your
professed subjection to the gospel of his Son. (Isa. 61:3)

Fifth, They that name--as afore--the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, should depart from iniquity,
that they may shew to the world the nature and power of those graces, which God the Father
has bestowed upon them that do religiously name the name of Christ. And the rather, because
he that religiously nameth that name, declareth even by his so naming of him, that he has received
grace of the Father, to enable him so to do. Now he cannot declare this by deeds, unless he
depart from iniquity; and his declaring of it by words alone, signifies little to God or man.
(Titus 1:16)

Sixth, We therefore that religiously name the name of Christ, should also depart from iniquity,
because the Spirit of the Father will else be grieved. (Eph. He that grieveth the Spirit of
God shall smart for it here, or in hell, or both. And that Spirit that sometimes did illuminate,
teach, and instruct them, can keep silence, can cause darkness, can withdraw itself, and suffer
the soul to sin more and more; and this last is the very judgment of judgments. He that grieves
the Spirit, quenches it; and he that quenches it, vexes it; add he that vexes it, sets it against
himself, and tempts it to hasten destruction upon himself. (1 Thess. 5:19) Wherefore take heed,
professors, I say take heed, you that religiously name the name of Christ, that you meddle
not with iniquity, that you tempt not the Spirit of the Lord to do such things against you,
whose beginnings are dreadful, and whose end in working of judgments is unsearchable. (Isa.
63:10; Acts 5:9) A man knows not whither he is going, nor where he shall stop, that is but
entering into temptation; nor whether he shall ever turn back, or go out at the gap that is
right before him. He that has begun to grieve the Holy Ghost, may be suffered to go on until
he has sinned that sin which is called the sin against the Holy Ghost. And if God shall once
give thee up to that, then thou art in the iron cage, out of which there is neither deliverance
nor redemption. Let every one, therefore, that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity,
upon this second consideration.

THIRD, In the next place, I come now to those arguments that do respect THYSELF.

First, Those that religiously name the name of Christ should, must, depart from iniquity, because
else our profession of him is but a lie. 'If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk
in darkness, we lie.' (I John 1:6) 'And walk in darkness;' that is, and walk in iniquity, and
depart not from a life that is according to the course of this world. 'He that saith, I know
him, and heepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.' (ch. 2:4) The
truth that he professes to know, and that he saith he hath experience of, is not in him. Every
man that nameth the name of Christ is not therefore a man of God, nor is the word in every
man's mouth, truth, though he makes profession of that worthy name. (1 Kings 17:24) It is then
truth in him, and to others with reference to him, when his mouth and his life shall agree.
(Rev. 2:2, 9; 3:9) Men may say they are apostles, and be liars: they may say they are Jews,
that is, Christians, and lie, and be liars, and lie in so saying. Now this is the highest kind
of lying, and certainly must therefore work the saddest sort of effects. Thus man's best things
are lies. His very saying, I know him, I have fellowship with him, I am a Jew, a Christian,
is a lie. His life giveth his mouth the lie: and all knowing men are sure he lies. 1. He lies
unto God: he speaks lies in the presence, and to the very face of God. Now this is a daring
thing: I know their lies, saith he; and shall he not recompense for this? See Acts 5:4; Rev.
21:8, 27; 22:15. and take heed. I speak to you that religiously name the name of Christ, and
yet do not depart from iniquity. 2. He lies unto men; every knowing man; every man that is
able to judge of the tree by the fruit, knows that that man is a liar, and that his whole profession
as to himself is a lie, if he doth not depart from iniquity. Thus Paul called the slow bellies,[8]
the unsound professors among the Cretians, liars. They were so in his eyes, for that their
profession of the name of Christ was not seconded with such a life as became a people professing
godliness. (Titus 1:12-16) They did not depart from iniquity. But again, 3. Such a man is a
liar to his own soul. Whatever such an one promiseth to himself, his soul will find it a lie.
There be many in the world that profess the name of Christ, and consequently promise their
soul the enjoyment of that good, that indeed is wrapt up in him, but they will certainly be
mistaken hereabout, and with the greatest terror will find it so, when they shall hear that
direful sentence, 'Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.' (Luke 8:27) Christ is resolved
that the loose-lived professor shall not stand in the judgment, nor any such sinners in the
congregation of the righteous. They have lied to God, to men, and to themselves; but Jesus
then will not lie unto them: he will plainly tell them that he hath not known them, and that
they shall not abide in his presence. But,

Second, Those that religiously name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, else, as
they are liars in their profession, so they are self deceivers. I told you but now such lie
to themselves, and so consequently they deceive themselves. 'But be ye doers of the word, and
not hearers only, deceiving your ownselves.' (John 1:22) It is a sad thing for a man, in and
about eternal things, to prove a deceiver of others; but for a man to deceive himself, his
ownself of eternal life, this is saddest of all; yet there is in man a propenseness so to do.
Hence the apostle says, be not deceived, and let no man deceive himself. And again, verse 26,
'If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his
own heart, this man's religion is vain.' These words, 'but deceiveth his own heart,' I have
much mused about: for they seem to me to be spoken to show how bold and prodigiously desperate
some men are, who yet religiously name the name of Christ: desperate, I say, at self deceiving.
He deceiveth his own heart; he otherwise persuadeth it, than of its ownself it would go: ordinarily
men are said to be deceived by their hearts, but here is a man that is said to deceive his
own heart, flattering it off from the scent and dread of those convictions, that by the Word,
sometimes it hath been under: persuading of it that there needs no such strictness of life
be added to a profession of faith in Christ, as by the gospel is called for: or that since
Christ has died for us, and rose again, and since salvation is alone in him, we need not be
so concerned, or be so strict to matter how we live. This man is a self deceiver; he deceives
his own heart. Self deceiving, and that about spiritual and eternal things, especially when
men do it willingly, is one of the most unnatural, unreasonable, and unaccountable actions
in the world. 1. It is one of the most unnatural actions; for here a man seeks his own ruin,
and privily lurks for his own life. (Prov. 1:18) We all cry out against him that murders his
children, his wife, or his own body, and condemn him to be one of those that has forgot the
rules and love of nature. But behold the man under consideration is engaged in such designs
as will terminate in his own destruction: he deceiveth his own soul. 2. This is also the most
unreasonable act; there can no cause, nor crumb of cause that has the least spark or dram of
reason, or of anything that looks like reason, be shown why a man should deceive himself, and
bereave his soul of eternal life. Therefore, 3. Such men are usually passed over with astonishment
and silence. 2:11-13)

But, above all this, as to this head, is the most amazing place, where it is said, that the
self deceiver makes his self deceiving his sport: 'Sporting themselves with their own deceivings.'
(2 Peter 2:13) These are a people far gone, to be sure, that are arrived to such a height of
negligence, carelessness, wantonness, and desperateness of spirit, as to take pleasure in,
and make a sport of, that which will assuredly deceive them for ever. But this is the fruit
of professing of Christ, and of not departing from iniquity. The wisdom and judgment of God
is such, as to give such over to the sporting of themselves in their own deceivings.

FOURTH. [Those arguments that respect THE WORLD.]

First, Those that religiously name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity, because
of the scandal that will else assuredly come upon religion, and the things of religion, through
them. Upon this head I may begin to write with a sigh, for never more of this kind than now!
28:8) Where are they even amongst those that strive for the rule, that mind it at all, when
it pinches upon their lusts, their pride, avarice, and wantonness? Are not, now-a-days, the
bulk of professors like those that 'strain at a gnat and swallow a camel?' (Matt. 23:24) Yea,
do not professors teach the wicked ones to be wicked? (Jer. 2:33) Ah! Lord God, this is a lamentation,
and will be for a lamentation. What a sore disease is now got into the church of God, that
the generality of professors should walk with scandal!

No fashion, no vanity, no profuseness, and yet no niggardliness, but is found among professors.
They pinch the poor, and nip from them their due, to maintain their own pride and vanity. I
shall not need to instance particulars; for from the rich to the poor, from the pastor to the
people, from the master to his man, and from the mistress to her maiden, all are guilty of
scandal, and of reproaching, by their lives, the name of the Lord; for they profess, and name
that worthy name of Christ, but are not as they should be, departed from iniquity.

1. Hence the name of God is polluted and reproached, even till God is weary and cries out,
'Pollute ye my name no more with your gifts and with your idols.' (Eze. 20:39) O do not pollute
my name, says God; rather leave off profession, and go every one to his wickedness. It would
far better secure the name of God from scandal and reproach, than for you to name the name
of Christ, and yet not to depart from iniquity. Then, though you sin, as now you do, the poor
world would not cry out, Ay, this is your religion! Then they would not have occasion to vilify
religion because of you, since you tell them that Christ and you are parted. But,

2. If you will not leave off to name the name of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity, you
also scandal the sincere professors of religion, and that is a grievous thing. There are a
people in the world that have made it their business, ever since they knew Christ, to cleanse
themselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit, and that desire to perfect holiness in
the fear of God; and you scandalous professors mixing yourselves with them, 'make their gold
look dim.' (Lam. 4:1) You are spots and blemishes to them; Jude 12, you are an evil mixing
itself with their good, and a scandal to their holy profession. (2 Peter 2:13) You are they
that make the heart of the righteous sad, whom God would not have, sad; you are they that offend
his little ones.

3. If you will not leave off to name the name of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity, you
continue to extend your scandal also to the word and doctrine of God. They that name the name
of Jesus religiously, should so carry it in the world, that they might adorn the doctrine of
God their Saviour; but thou that professest and yet departest not from iniquity, thou causest
the name and doctrine which thou professest to be blasphemed and reproached by the men of this
world; and that is a sad thing, a thing that will bring so heavy a load upon thee, when God
shall open thine eyes, and he will open them either here or in hell-fire, that thou wilt repent
it with great bitterness of soul. (1 Tim. 6:1) The Lord smite thee to the making of thee sensible
to thy shame and conversion, if it be his blessed will. Amen! But,

4. If thou wilt not leave off to name the name of Christ, nor yet depart from iniquity, thou
wilt bring reproach, scorn, and contempt upon thyself. For 'sin is a reproach to any people.'
(Prov. 14:34). (1.) These are they that God will hold in great contempt and scorn. (Isa. 1)
(2.) These are they that his people shall have in great contempt. 'Therefore,' saith he, 'have
I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept
my ways,' but have lifted up the face against my law.[9] (Mal. 2:9; Jer. 25:9, 18) 3. Such
shall also be contemned and had in derision of the men of this world. They shall be a hissing,
a bye-word, a taunt, and a reproach among all people. 'For them that honour me,' saith God,
'I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. (1 Sam. 2:30) I remember
that Philpot used to tell the Papists that they danced with their buttocks uncovered, in a
net,[10] because of the evil of their ways; (Isa. 20:4) and the Lord bids professors have a
care, 'that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear,' or lest they walk naked, and their shame
be discovered. For those professors that depart not from iniquity, however they think of themselves,
their nakedness is seen of others: and if it be a shame to the modest to have their nakedness
seen of others, what bold and brazen brows have they who are not ashamed to show their nakedness,
yea, the very shame of it, to all that dwell about them? And yet thus doth every one that religiously
names the name of Christ, and yet doth not depart from iniquity.

Second, Those that religiously name the name of Christ, and do not depart from iniquity, they
are the cause of the perishing of many. 'Woe,' saith Christ, 'unto the world because of offences,'
(Matt. 18:7). And again, 'Woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!' These are they that
cause many to stumble at sin, and fall into hell. Hark, you that are such, what God says to
you: 'Ye have caused many to stumble at the law,' and at religion. (Mal. 2:8) Men that are
for taking of occasion you give it them; men that would enter into the kingdom, you puzzle
and confound them with your iniquity, while you name the name of Christ, and do not depart
therefrom. One sinner destroyeth much good; these are the men that encourage the vile to be
yet more vile; these be the men that quench weak desires in others; and these be the men that
tempt the ignorant to harden themselves against their own salvation. A professor that hath
not forsaken his iniquity, is like one that comes out of the pest-house, among the whole, with
his plague sores running upon him. What shall I say? A man that nameth the name of Christ,
and that departeth not from iniquity, to whom may he be compared? The Pharisees, for that they
professed religion, but walked not answerable thereto, unto what doth Christ compare them but
to serpents and vipers? What does he call them but hypocrites, whited walls, painted sepulchres,
fools, and blind? and tells them that they made men more the children of hell than they were
before. (Matt. 23) Wherefore such an one cannot go out of the world by himself: for as he gave
occasion of scandal when he was in the world, so is he the cause of the damnation of many.
'The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.' (Prov. 11:30) But what is the fruit of the
wicked, of the professors that are wicked? why, not to perish alone in their iniquity. (Job
22:20) These, as the dragon, draw many of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth with
their most stinking tail. (Rev. 12:4) Cast many a professor into earthly and carnal delights,
with their most filthy conversations.

The apostle did use to weep when he spake of these professors, such offence he knew they were
and would be in the world. (Acts 20:30; Phil 3:18, 19) These are the chief of the engines of
Satan, with these he worketh wonders. One Baalam, one Jeroboam, one Ahab; O how many fish bring
such to Satan's net! These are the tares that he strives to sow among the wheat, for he knows
they are mischief to it. 'Wherefore, let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from
iniquity.'

Fifth, Those that religiously name the name of Christ, and do not depart from iniquity, how
will they die; and how will they look that man in the face, unto the profession of whose name
they have entailed an unrighteous conversation? Or do they think that he doth not know what
they have done, or that they may take him off with a few cries and wringing of hands, when
he is on the throne to do judgment against transgressors? Oh! it had been better they had not
known, had not professed; yea, better they had never been born; for as Christ said of Judas,
so may it be said of these, it had been good for that man if he had never been born; and as
Christ says it had been good, so Peter says it had been better. (Mark 14:21; 2 Peter 2:20,
21) Good they had not been born, and better they had not known and made profession of the name
of Christ.

But perhaps some may ask me,

WHAT INIQUITY THEY MUST DEPART FROM THAT RELIGIOUSLY NAME THE NAME OF CHRIST?

First, I answer first, in general, those that religiously profess the name of Christ, must
depart from ALL iniquity. They should lay aside every weight; they should fly 'all appearance
of evil.' (Heb 12:2; 1 Thess. 5:22) Many there be that are willing to part with some sins,
some pleasures, some unjust profits, if they may be saved; but this selling of all, parting
with all, forsaking of all, is a very hard chapter.

And yet the Lord Jesus lays it there, saying so likewise, 'whosoever he be of you,' of any
of you that professeth my name, 'that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.'
(Luke 14:33) Christ by this text requireth more of them that are his than to forsake all iniquity.
Wherefore, to be sure, every sin is included. No less than universal obedience will prove a
man sincere. A divided heart is a faulty one. (Hosea 10:2) He that forsaketh not every sin
is partial in the law, nor can he have respect to all God's commandments. (Job 20:13; John
14:21-24) There can be no true love to Christ where there are reserves; he that will hide any
one sin in his bosom, or that will keep it, as the phrase is, under his tongue, is a secret
enemy to Jesus Christ. He loveth not Christ that keepeth not his sayings. To halt between two
is nought, and no man can serve two masters. Christ is a master, and sin is a master; yea,
and masters are they so opposite, that he that at all shall cleave to the one shall by the
other be counted his enemy. If sin at all be countenanced, Christ counts himself despised.
What man would count himself beloved of his wife that knows she hath a bosom for another? 'Thou
shalt not be for another man' saith he, 'so will I be for thee.' (Hosea 3:3) Would the king
count him a loyal subject who would hide in his house, nourish in his bed, and feed at his
table, one that implacably hateth and seeketh to murder his majesty? Why, sin is such an enemy
to the Lord Jesus Christ; therefore, as kings command that traitors be delivered up to justice,
so Christ commands that we depart from iniquity. 'Take away all iniquity,' is a good prayer,
and to 'resist unto blood, striving against sin,' is a good warfare, and he that brings 'every
thought to the obedience of Christ' gets a brave victory. (Hosea 14:2; Heb. 12:4; 2 Cor. 10:5)
Grace leaveneth the whole soul, and so consequently all the parts thereof. Now where the whole
is leavened, the taste must needs be the same throughout. Grace leaves no power, faculty, or
passion of the soul unsanctified, wherefore there is no corner in a sanctified soul where sin
may hide his head, to find rest and abode without control. Consequently, he that has a harbour
for this or that sin, and that can find a hiding-place and an abode for it in his heart, is
no Christian man. Let them then that christianly name the name of Christ, make it manifest
that they do not do it feignedly, by departing from iniquity. But,

Second, And more particularly, they that name the name of Christ, as above, let them depart
from their CONSTITUTION-SIN, or, if you will, the sin that their temper most inclines them
to. Every man is not alike inclined to the same sin, but some to one and some to another. Now
let the man that professes the name of Christ religiously, consider with himself, unto what
sin or vanity am I most inclined; Is it pride? Is it covetousness? Is it fleshly lusts? And
let him labour, by all means, to leave off and depart from that. This is that which David called
his own iniquity, and saith, 'I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.'
(Psa. 18:23) Rightly are these two put together, for it is not possible that he should be an
upright man that indulgeth or countenanceth his constitution-sin; but on the contrary, he that
keeps himself from that will be upright as to all the rest; and the reason is, because if a
man has that grace, as to trample upon and mortify his darling, his bosom, his only sin, he
will more easily and more heartily abhor and fly the rest.

And, indeed, if a man will depart from iniquity, he must depart from his darling sin first;
for as long as that is entertained, the others, at least those that are most suiting with that
darling, will always be haunting of him. There is a man that, has such and such haunt his house,
and spend his substance, and would be rid of them, but cannot; but now, let him rid himself
of that, for the sake of which they haunt his house, and then he shall with case be rid of
them. Thus it is with sin. There is a man that is plagued with many sins, perhaps because he
embraceth one: well, let him turn that one out of doors, and that is the way to be rid of the
rest. Keep thee from thy darling, thy bosom, thy constitution-sin.

Motives to prevail with thee to fall in with this exhortation, are several.

1. There can no great change appear in thee, make what profession of Christ thou wilt, unless
thou cast away thy bosom sin. A man's constitution-sin is, as I may call it, his visible sin;
it is that by which his neighbours know him and describe him, whether it be pride, covetousness,
lightness, or the like. Now if these abide with thee, though thou shouldest be much reformed
in thy notions, and in other parts of thy life, yet say thy neighbours, he is the same man
still; his faith has not saved him from his darling; he was proud afore, and is proud still;
was covetous afore, and is covetous still; was light and wanton afore, and is so still. He
is the same man, though he has got a new mouth. But now, if thy constitution-sin be parted
with, if thy darling be cast away, thy conversion is apparent, it is seen of all, for the casting
away of that is death to the rest, and ordinarily makes a change throughout.

2. So long as thy constitution-sin remains, as winked at by thee, so long thou art an hypocrite
before God, let thy profession be what it will; also, when conscience shall awake and be commanded
to speak to thee plainly what thou art, it will tell thee so, to thy no little vexation and
perplexity.

3. Besides, do what thou canst, so long as thou remainest thus thou wilt be of a scandalous
life. No honour is brought to religion by such. But,

Again, As they that name the name of Christ 'should depart from their constitution-sin, so
they should depart from the sins of other men's tempers also. Much harm among professors is
done by each others' sins. There is a man that has clean escaped from those who live in error,
has shaken off the carnal world and the men thereof, and is come among professors; but, behold,
there also he meeteth with wicked men, with men that have not departed from iniquity; and there
he is entangled. This is a sad thing, and yet so it is. I doubt there are some in the world,
I mean professors, that will curse the day that ever they were acquainted with some professors.
There are professors that are defilers, professors that are 'wicked men,' professors of whom
a wicked man may learn to sin. (Jer. 5:26; 2:33) Take heed of these, lest, having fled from
thine own sins, thou shouldest be taken with the sins of others. 'Be not partakers of other
men's sins,' is the counsel and caution that Paul giveth to Timothy, if he would keep himself
pure. (1 Tim. 5:22)

4. Dost thou profess the name of Christ, and dost thou pretend to be a man departing from iniquity?
Then take heed thou dost not deceive thyself, by changing one bad way of sinning for another
bad way of sinning. This was a trick that Israel played of old; for when God's prophets followed
them hard with demands of repentance and reformation, then they would 'gad about to change
their ways.' (Jer. 2:36) But, behold, they would not change a bad way for a good, but one bad
way for another, hopping, as the squirrel, from bough to bough, but not willing to forsake
the tree. Hence they were said to return, but not to the Most High. Take heed, I say, of this.
Many leave off to be drunkards, and fall in with covetousness. Many fall off from covetousness
to pride and lasciviousness: take heed of this. (Hosea 7:16) This is a grand deceit, and a
common one too, a deceit of a long standing, and almost a disease epidemical among professors.

Many times men change their darling sins, as some change their wives and servants: that which
would serve for such an one this year may not serve to be so for the year ensuing. Hypocrisy
would do awhile ago, but now debauchery. Profaneness would do when profaneness was in fashion,
but now a deceitful profession. Take heed, professor, that thou dost not throw away thy old
darling sin for a new one. Men's tempers alter. Youth is for pride and wantonness; middle age
for cunning and craft; old age for the world and covetousness. Take heed, therefore, of deceit
in this thing.

5. Some do depart from iniquity, as persons in wrangling fits depart from one another; to wit,
for a time, but when the quarrel is over, by means of some intercessor, they are reconciled
again. O! Satan is the intercessor between the soul and sin, and though the breach between
these two may seem to be irreconcilable; yea, though the soul hath sworn it will never give
countenance to so vile a thing as sin is more; yet he can tell how to make up this difference,
and to fetch them back to their vomit again, who, one would have thought, had quite escaped
his sins, and been gone. (2 Peter 2:18-22) Take heed, therefore, O professor. For there is
danger of this, and the height of danger lies in it; and I think that Satan, to do this thing,
makes use of those sins again, to begin this rejoinder, which he findeth most suitable to the
temper and constitution of the sinner. These are, as I may call them, the master sins; they
suit, they jump with the temper of the soul. These, as the little end of the wedge, enter with
ease, and so make way for those that come after, with which Satan knows he can rend the soul
in pieces. Wherefore,

6. To help this, take heed of parleying with thy sins again, when once thou hast departed from
them: sin has a smooth tongue; if thou hearken to its enchanting language, ten thousand to
one but thou art entangled. See the saying of the wise man, 'with her much fair speech she
caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him. 7:21, 22) He heard her
charm, and by hearing is noosed, and led away to her house, which is the way to hell, 'going
down to the chambers of death.'(ver. 27) Take heed, therefore, of listening to the charms wherewith
sin enchanteth the soul. In this, be like the deaf adder, stop thine ear, plug it up to sin,
and let it only be open to hear the words of God.

Third, Let them that name the name of Christ depart from the iniquity of THE TIMES. There are
sins that may be called the iniquity of the day. It was thus in Noah's day, it was thus in
Lot's day, and it was thus in Christ's day--I mean, in the days of his flesh: and it is a famous
thing for professors to keep themselves from the iniquities of the times. Here lay Noah's excellency,
here lay Lot's excellency, and here will lie thy excellency, if thou keep thyself from the
iniquity of this day. Keep or 'save yourselves from this untoward generation,' is seasonable
counsel, (Acts 2:40) but taken of but few; the sin of the time, or day, being as a strong current
or stream that drives all before it. Hence Noah and Lot were found, as it were, alone, in the
practice of this excellent piece of righteousness in their generation. (Gen. 7:1)

The same I say of Lot, he kept himself from the sin of Sodom; and hence Peter cries him up
for such a righteous man. 'Just Lot,' saith he, 'that righteous man,' whose righteous soul
was vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked. Mark, 'a just man,' 'a righteous man,'
'his righteous soul,' &c. But how obtained he this character? Why, he abhorred the sin of his
time, he fell not in with the sin of the people, but was afflicted and vexed thereabout; yea,
it was to him a daily burden. 'For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing,
vexed his righteous soul from day to day, with their unlawful deeds. So David, 'I beheld,'
saith he, 'the transgressors, and was grieved, because they kept not thy word.' (Psa. 119:158)
The sin of the times is to God the worst of sins; and to fall in with the sin of the times
is counted as the highest of transgressions. Consequently, to keep from them, though a man
should, through infirmity, be guilty of others, yet he is accounted upright. And hence it is,
I think, that David was called a man after God's own heart; to wit, because he served his own
generation by the will of God; or, as the margent reads, after he had, in his own age, served
the will of God. (Acts 13) By the sin of the times, Satan, as it were, set up his standard
in defiance to God; seeking then to cause his name, in a signal way, to be dishonoured, and
that by the professors of that age. And hence it is that the Lord doth manifest such wrath
against his people that are guilty of the common sin of their day, and that he shews such special
favour to them that abstain therefrom. Was there no more, think you, but Noah, in his generation,
that feared God? Yes, several, no doubt; but he was the man that kept clear of the sin of his
day, therefore he and his family must be partakers of God's deliverance; the other must die
before, and not be permitted to the mercy of the ark, nor to see the new world with Noah. Unbelief
was the sin of the day when Israel was going from Egypt to Canaan; therefore all that were
guilty of that transgression must be denied to go in to see that good land, yea, though it
were Moses himself. 'And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to
sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation
into the land which I have given them.' (Num. 20:12)

The sin of the day is an high transgression; from the which, because Caleb and Joshua, kept
then selves, God kept them from all the blasting plagues that overtook all the rest, and gave
them the land which he had promised to their fathers. 'But my servant Caleb, because he had
another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto
he went; and his seed shall possess it.' (Num. 14:24) Idolatry was the sin of the day just
before Israel were carried captive into Babylon. Now those of the priests that went astray
then, even they say, God shall bear their iniquity. They shall enter into my sanctuary, and
they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.' (Ezek.
44:15, 16)

Great complaints have we now among professors, of deadness in duties, barrenness of the ministry,
and of the withdrawing of God from his people; but I can tell you a cause of all this, namely,
the sin of the day is got into the church of God, and has defiled that holy place. This is
the ground and cause of all these things; nor is it like to be otherwise, till the cause shall
be removed. If any should ask me what are the sins of our day, I would say they are conspicuous,
they are open, they are declared as Sodom's were. (Isa. 3:9) They that have embraced them,
are not ashamed of them; yea, they have got the boldness to plead for them, and to count them
their enemies that seek to reform them. All tables are full of vomit and filthiness.

And I say again, when you find out a professor that is not horribly tainted with some of these
things, I exclude not the ministers nor their families, let him be as a beacon upon a hill,
or as an ensign in our land. But says one, Would you have us singular? and says another, Would
you have us make ourselves ridiculous? and says a third, Such and such, more godly-wise than
we, do so. But I answer, if God has made you singular, and called you to grace, that is singular;
and bid you walk in ways that are singular, and diverse from the ways of all others. Yea, if
to depart from iniquity will make you ridiculous, if to be holy in all manner of conversation
will make you ridiculous, then be contented to be counted so. As for the godly-wise you speak
of, let them manifest themselves to be such by departing from iniquity. I am sure that their
being tainted with sins of the day, will not prove them godly-wise. 'Behold, I have taught
you,' said Moses, 'statute and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me; that ye should
do so in the land whither you go to possess it. And why follow the apish fashions of the world?
Hath the God of wisdom set them on foot among us? or is it because the devil and wicked men,
the inventors of these vain toys, have outwitted the law of God? 'what nation is there so great,
who hath God so nigh unto them' as his people have, and as he 'is in all things that we call
upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous,
as all this law,' said Moses, which I set before you this day?' (Deut. 4:5-8) This then is
that which declareth us to be godly-wise, when we keep our soul diligently to the holy words
of God; and fit not only our tongues and lips, but also our lives thereto.

Fourth, But again, let them that name the name of Christ depart from the iniquity, that is,
as I may call it, from FAMILY INIQUITY. There is a house iniquity; an iniquity that loves not
to walk abroad, but to harbour within doors. This the holy man David was aware of, therefore
he said that he would behave himself 'wisely, in a perfect way;' yea, saith he, 'I will walk
within my house with a perfect heart.' (Psa. 101:2)

Now this house iniquity standeth in these things. (l.) In domestic broils and quarrels. (2.)
In domestic chamberings and wantonness. (3.) In domestic misorders of children and servants.

1. For house broils and quarrels, it is an iniquity to be departed from, whether it be betwixt
husband and wife, or otherwise. This, as I said, is an iniquity that loves not to walk abroad,
but yet it is an horrible plague within doors. And, many that shew like saints abroad, yet
act the part of devils when they are at home, by giving way to this house iniquity; by cherishing
of this house iniquity. This iniquity meeteth the man and his wife at the very threshold of
the door, and will not suffer them to enter, no not with one foot into the house in peace,
but how far this is from walking together as heirs of the grace of life, is easy to be determined.
Men should carry it in love to their wives, as Christ doth to his church; and wives should
carry it to their husbands, as the church ought to carry it to her Saviour. (Eph. 5:21-28;
1 Peter 3:7) And until each relation be managed with respect to these things, this house iniquity
will be cherished there. O! God sees within doors as well as without, and will judge too for
the iniquity of the house as well as for that more open.

2. As house iniquity standeth in domestic broils and contentions; so it also standeth in chamberings
and wantonness. (Rom. 13:13) Wherefore the apostle putteth them both together, saying, 'not
in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.' This chambering and wantonness is
of a more general extent, being entertained by all, insomuch, that sometimes from the head
to the foot all are horribly guilty. But, 'it is a shame to speak of those things that are
done of some in secret;' for 'through the lusts of their own hearts, they dishonour their own
bodies between themselves,' 'working that which is unseemly,' (Eph. 5:12; Rom. 1:24, 27) to
their ignominy and contempt, if not with their fellows et with God, who sees them, for the
darkness hideth not from him.' (Psa. 139:12) It was for this kind of iniquity with other, that
God told Eli that he would 'judge his house for ever.' (1 Sam. 3:13) also the words that follow
are to be trembled at, that say, 'The iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice
nor offering for ever.' (ver. 14) Such an evil thing is house iniquity in the eyes of the God
that is above.

3. As domestic iniquity standeth in these, so also in the disorders of children and servants.
Children's unlawful carriages to their parents is a great house iniquity; yea, and a common
one too. (2 Tim. 3:2, 3) Disobedience to parents is one of the sins of the last days.

I will add, that this sin reigns in little and great, for not only the small and young, but
men, are disobedient to their parent; and indeed, this is the sin with a shame, that men shall
be disobedient to parents; the sin of the last times, that men shall be 'disobedient to parents,'
and 'without natural affection.' Where now-a-days shall we see children that are come to men
and women's estate, carry it as by the word they are bound, to their aged and worn-out parents?
I say, where is the honour they should put upon them? who speaks to their aged parents with
that due regard to that relation, to their age, to their worn-out condition, as becomes them?
Is it not common now-a-days, for parents to be brought into bondage and servitude by their
children? For parents to be under, and children above; for parents to be debased, and children
to lord it over them. Nor doth this sin go alone in the families where it is; no, those men
are lovers of their ownselves; covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemous, that are disobedient
to their parents. This is that the prophet means, when he saith, 'The child shall behave himself
proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.' (Isa. 3:5) This is a common
sin, and a crying sin, and to their shame be it spoken that are guilty; a sin that makes men
vile to a high degree, and yet it is the sin of professors. But behold how the apostle brands
them; he saith, such have but 'a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof,' and bids
the godly shut them out of their fellowship. (1 Tim. 3:5) This sin also is, I fear, grown to
such a height in some, as to make them weary of their parents, and of doing their duty to them.
Yea, I wish that some are not 'murderers of fathers and mothers,' by their thoughts, while
they secretly long after, and desire their death, that the inheritance may be theirs, and that
they may be delivered from obedience to their parents.(1 Tim. 1:9) This is a sin in the house,
in the family, a sin that is kept in hugger-mugger, close; but God sees it, and hath declared
his dislike against it, by an implicit threatening, to cut them off that are guilty of it.
(Eph. 5:1-5) Let them then that name the name of Christ, depart from this iniquity.

Disorders of servants is also an house iniquity, and to be departed from by the godly. 'He
that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my, house;' said David; and 'he that telleth lies
shall not tarry in my sight.' (Psa. 101:7) One of the rarities in Solomon's house, and which
the queen of Sheba was so taken with, was the goodly order of his servants. (2 Chron. 9:4)

Some of the disorders of servants are to be imputed to the governors of families, and some
to the servants themselves. Those that are to be imputed to the governors of families, are
such as these: (1.) When the servant learns his vileness of his master, or of her mistress.
(2.) When servants are countenanced by the master against the mistress; or by the mistress
against the master; or when in opposition to either, they shall be made equals in things. (3.)
When the extravagancies of servants are not discountenanced and rebuked by their superiors,
and the contrary taught them by word and life.

Those to be imputed to the servants themselves are: (1.) Their want of reverence to their superiors.
(2.) Their backbiting and slandering of them. (3.) Their unfaithfulness in serving of them.
(4.) Their murmuring at their lawful commands, &c.

From all these domestic iniquities, let every one depart that religiously nameth the name of
Christ. And before I leave this head, let me, to enforce my exhortation, urge upon you a few
considerations to work with you yet further to depart from these house iniquities.

Consider 1. A man's house, and his carriage there, doth more bespeak the nature and temper
of his mind, than all public profession. If I were to judge of a man for my life, I would not
judge of him by his open profession, but by his domestic behaviours. Open profession is like
a man's best cloak, the which is worn by him when he walketh abroad, and with many is made
but little use of at home. But now what a man is at home, that he is indeed. There is abroad,
my behaviour to my friends, and customers, my outward honesty in dealing and avoiding gross
sins. There is at home, my house, my closet, my heart; and my house, my closet, shew most what
I am: though not to the world, yet to my family, and to angels. And a good report from those
most near, and most capable of advantage to judge, is like to be truer than to have it only
from that which is gotten by my observers abroad. The outside of the platter and cup may look
well, when within they may be full of excess. (Matt. 23:25-28) The outward shew and profession
may be tolerable, when within doors may be bad enough. I and my house 'will serve the Lord,'
is the character of a godly man. (Josh. 24:15)

Consider 2. As the best judgment is made upon a man from his house, so that man is like to
have the approbation of God for good, that is faithful in all his house. 'I know Abraham,'
says God, 'that he will command his children, and his household after him, and they shall keep
the way of the Lord.' (Gen. 18:15) To make religion and the power of godliness the chief of
my designs at home, among those among whom God by a special hand has placed me, is that which
is pleasing to God, and that obtaineth a good report of him. But to pass these, and to come
to other things.

Consider 3. A master of a family, and mistress of the same, are those that are entrusted of
God with those under their tuition and care, to be brought up for him, be they children or
servants. This is plain from the text last mentioned; wherefore here is a charge committed
to thee of God. Look to it, and consider with thyself, whether thou hast done such duty and
service for God in this matter, as, setting common frailties aside, thou canst with good conscience
lift up thy face unto God; the which to be sure thou canst by no means do, if iniquity, to
the utmost, be not banished out of thy house.

Consider 4. And will it not be a sad complaint that thy servant shall take up against thee,
before the Judge at the last day, that he learnt the way to destruction in thy house, who art
a professor. Servants, though themselves be carnal, expect, when they come into the house of
professors, that there they shall see religion in its spangling colours; but behold, when he
enters thy door, he finds sin and wickedness there. There is pride instead of humility, and
height and raillery[11] instead of meekness and holiness of mind. But perhaps thy heart is
so hard, and thy mind so united to the pleasing of thy vile affections, that thou wilt say,
'What care I for my servant? I took him to do my work, not to train him up in religion. Well,
suppose the soul of thy servant be thus little worth in thine eyes; yet what wilt thou say
for thy children, who behold all thy ways, and are as capable of drinking up the poison of
thy footsteps, as the swine is of drinking up swill: I say, what wilt thou do for them? Children
will learn to be naught of parents, of professing parents soonest of all. They will be tempted
to think all that they do is right. I say, what wilt thou say to this? Or art thou like the
ostrich whom God hath deprived of wisdom, and has hardened her heart against her young? (Job
39:13-17) Will it please thee when thou shalt see that thou hast brought forth children to
the murderer? or when thou shalt hear them cry, I learnt to go on in the paths of sin by the
carriages of professing parents.[12] (Heb. 9:13) If it was counted of old a sad thing for a
man to bring forth children to the sword, as Ephraim did, what will it be for a man to bring
up children for hell and damnation? But,

Fifth, Let those that name the name of Christ depart from the iniquity of THEIR CLOSET. This
may be called part of the iniquity of the house; but because it is not public, but as a retired
part, therefore I put it here by itself. There are many closets sins that professors may be
guilty of, and from which they have need to depart. As,

1. There is the pride of a library, that is, the study or closet, and I doubt this sin and
iniquity to this day is with many great professors, and in my judgment it is thus manifested.
(l.) When men secretly please themselves to think it is known what a stock of books they have,
or when they take more pleasure in the number of, than the matter contained in, their books.
(2.) When they buy books rather to make up a number than to learn to be good and godly men
thereby. (3.) When, though they own their books to be good and godly, yet they will not conform
thereto.

This is an iniquity now on foot in this land, and ought to be departed from. It is better to
have no books, and depart from iniquity, than to have a thousand, and not to be bettered in
my soul thereby.

2. There is an iniquity that attends the closet, which I may call by the name of vacancy. When
men have a closet to talk of, not to pray in; a closet to look upon, not to bow before God
in: a closet to lay up gold in, but not to mourn in for the sins of my life; a closet that
could it speak, would say, My owner is seldom here upon his knees before the God of heaven;
seldom here humbling himself for the iniquity of his heart, or to thank God for the mercies
of his life.

3. Then also a man is guilty of closet-iniquity, when though he doth not utterly live in the
neglect of duty, he formally, carnally, and without reverence, and godly fear, performs it.
Also, when he asketh God for that which he cannot abide should be given him, or when he prayeth
for that in his closet, that he cannot abide in his house, nor in his life.

4. Then also a man is guilty of closet-iniquity, when he desireth that the sound of the devotion
he doth there, may be heard by them without in the house, the street, or of those that dwell
by; for a closet is only for the man and God to do things in secretly. (Matt. 6:6)

These things let the professor beware of, lest he add to his iniquity, sin, until he and it
comes to be loathsome. The closet is by God appointed for men to wait upon him in, and to do
it without hypocrisy; to wait there for his mind and his will, and also for grace to perform
it. And how can a man that went last time out of his closet to be naught, have the face to
come thither again? If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer; and
if so, then he will not meet me in my closet; and if so, then I shall quickly be weary thereof,
being left to myself, and the vanity of my mind.

It is a great thing to be a closet Christian, and to hold it; he must be a close Christian,
that will be a closet Christian. When I say a closet Christian, I mean one that is so in the
hidden part, and that also walks with God. Many there be that profess Christ who do oftener,
in London[13] frequent the coffee-house than their closet; and that sooner in a morning run
to make bargains than to pray unto God, and begin the day with him. But for thee, who professest
the name of Christ, do thou depart from all these things; do thou make conscience of reading
and practising; do thou follow after righteousness; do thou make conscience of beginning the
day with God; for he that begins it not with him will hardly end it with him; he that runs
from God in the morning will hardly find him at the close of the day; nor will he that begins
with the world and the vanities thereof, in the first place, be very capable of walking with
God all the day after. It is he that finds God in his closet that will carry the savour of
him into his house, his shop, and his more open conversation. When Moses had been with God
in the mount his face shone, he brought of that glory into the camp. (Exo. 34)

Sixth, I add again, let those that name the name of Christ depart from the iniquity THAT CLEAVETH
TO OPINIONS. This is a sad age for that; let opinions in themselves be never so good, never
so necessary, never so innocent, yet there are spirits in the world that will entail iniquity
to them, and will make the vanity so inseparable with the opinion, that it is almost impossible
with some to take in the opinion and leave out the iniquity, that by the craft and subtility
of Satan is joined thereto. Nor is this a thing new, and of yesterday; it has been thus almost
in all ages of the church of God, and that not only in things small and indifferent, but in
things fundamental and most substantial. I need instance in none other for proof thereof, but
the doctrine of faith and holiness. If faith be preached as that which is absolutely necessary
to justification, then faith fantastical, and looseness and remissness in life, with some,
are joined therewith. If holiness of life be preached as necessary to salvation, then (they
say that) faith is undervalued, and set below its place, and works as to justification, with
God set up and made co-partners with Christ's merits in the remission of sins. Thus iniquity
joineth itself with the great and most substantial truths of the gospel, and it is hard to
receive any good opinion whatever, but iniquity will join itself thereto. (Eph. 5:12, 13) Wicked
spirits do not only tempt men to transgress the moral law, but do present themselves in heavenly
things, working there, and labouring in them, to wrest the judgment, and turn the understanding
and conscience awry in those high and most important things. Wherefore, I say, we must be the
more watchful and careful lest we be abused in our notions and best principles, by the iniquities
that join themselves thereto. What is the cause? Is the truth? No? God is the author of no
confusion in the church of God. (1 Cor. 14:33) It is, then, because every man, makes too much
of his own opinion, abounds too much in his own sense, and takes not care to separate his opinion
from the iniquity that cleaveth thereto. That this confusion is in the church of Christ, I
am of Paul, I of Apollos, I of Cephas, and I of Christ, is too manifest. But what unbecoming
language is this for the children of the same father, members of the same body, and heirs of
the same glory, to be accustomed to? Whether is it pride, or hypocrisy, or ignorance, or self,
or the devil, or the jesuit, or all these jointly working with the church, that makes and maintains
these names of distinction? This distinction and want of love, this contempt of one another,
those base and undervaluing thoughts of brethren, will be better seen, to the shame and confusion
of some, in the judgment. And it would be well if those that so stickle by their private and
unscriptural notions, which only is iniquity cleaving to truth,--I say, it would be well if
such were more sound in faith and morals, and if by their lives they gave better conviction
to the world that the truth and grace of Christ is in them.

Sometimes so much iniquity is mixed with good opinions, that it prevails, not only to hurt
men in this world, but to drown them in misery everlasting. It was good that the Jews did own
and allow the ceremonies of the law, but since the iniquity that joined itself thereto did
prevail with them to make those ceremonies copartners with Christ in those matters that pertained
to Christ alone, therefore they perished in them. The Galatians also, with many of the Corinthians,
had like to have been overthrown by these things. Take heed, therefore, of that iniquity that
seeketh to steal with the truth into thy heart, thy judgment, and understanding.

Nor doth one iniquity come without another; they are linked together, and come by companies,
and therefore usually they that are superstitious in one thing, are corrupted in several other.
The more a man stands upon his points[14] to justify himself and to condemn his holy brethren,
the more danger he is in of being overcome of diverse evils. And it is the wisdom of God to
let it be so, that flesh might not glory in his presence. 'His soul, which is lifted up,' (Hab.
65:5) But what is the sentence of God concerning those? Why, these are a smoke in my nose,
a fire that burneth all the day. Wherefore, as I said before, so I say now again, take heed
of the iniquity that cleaveth to good opinions; the which thou wilt in nowise be able to shun
unless thou be clothed with humility.[15] But,

Seventh, Let them that name the name of Christ depart from HYPOCRISIES. This exhortation is
as the first, general; for hypocrisies are of that nature, that they spread themselves as the
leprosy of the body, all over; not the faculties of the soul only, but all the duties of a
man. So that here is a great iniquity to be parted from, an over-spreading iniquity. This sin
will get into all thy profession, into every whit of it, and will make the whole of it a loathsome
stink in the nostrils of God. (Ezek. 8:12; Mal. 2:2; Matt. 6:2; 8:20, 21; 23:15; Luke 12:1,
2; 20:19, 20; 1 Cor. 13:3; 2 Cor. 6:6; Col. 2:23; 2 Tim. 1:5) So that here is, for the keeping
of thy soul upright and sincere, more than ordinary diligence to be used. Hypocrisy is one
of the most abominable of iniquities. It is a sin that dares it with God. It is a sin that
saith God is ignorant, or that he delighteth in iniquity. It is a sin that flattereth, that
dissembleth, that offereth to hold God, as it were, fair in hand, about that which is neither
purposed nor intended. It is also a sin that puts a man upon studying and contriving to beguile
and deceive his neighbour as to the bent and intent of the heart, and also as to the cause
and end of actions. It is a sin that persuadeth a man to make a show of civility, morality,
or Christian religion, as a cloak, a pretence, a guise to deceive withal. It will make a man
preach for a place and praise, rather than to glorify God and save souls; it will put a man
upon talking, that he may be commended; it will make a man, when he is at prayer in his closet,
strive to be heard without doors; it will make a man ask for that he desireth not, and show
zeal in duties, when his heart is as cold, as senseless, and as much without savour as a clod;
it will make a man pray to be seen and heard of men, rather than to be heard of God; it will
make a man strive to weep when he repenteth not, and to pretend much friendship when he doth
not love; it will make a man pretend to experience and sanctification when he has none, and
to faith and sincerity when he knows not what they are.

Helps against this sin there are many, some of which I shall now present thee with. (Psa. 16:2;
21:2; Luke 16:15). 1. Believe that God's eye is always upon thy heart, to observe all the ways,
all the turnings and windings of it. 2. Believe that he observeth all thy ways and marks thy
actions. 'The ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.'
(Prov. 5:21) 3. Believe that there is a day of judgment a-coming, and that then all things
shall be revealed and discovered as they are. 'For there is nothing covered that shall not
be revealed; neither hid that shall not be known. Believe that a hypocrite, with the cunning
and shrouds for his hypocrisy, can go unseen no further than the grave, nor can he longer flatter
himself with thoughts of life. For 'the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
hypocrite but for a moment. He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; yea, he shall
be chased away as a vision of the night.' (Job 20:5-8) 5. Believe that God will not spare a
hypocrite in the judgment, no, nor punish him neither with ordinary damnation; but as they
have here sinned in a way by themselves, so there they shall receive greater damnation. (Luke
20:47)

Of all sins, the sin of hypocrisy bespeaks a man most in love with some lust, because he dissembleth
both with God and man to keep it.

For a conclusion upon this sevenfold answer to the question above propounded, let me advise
those that are tender of the name of Christ, to have regard to these things.

Advice First, as well acquainted with the Word, and with the general rules of holiness; to
wit, with the moral law; the want of this is a cause of much unholiness of conversation. These
licentious and evil times wherein we live are full of iniquity; nor can we, though we never
so much love God, do our duty, as we are enjoined, if we do not know it. The law is cast behind
the back of many, when it should be carried in the hand and heart, that we might do it, to
the end [that] the gospel which we profess might be glorified in the world. Let then the law
be with thee to love it, and do it in the spirit of the gospel, that thou be not unfruitful
in thy life. Let the law, I say, be with thee, not as it comes from Moses, but from Christ;
for though thou art set free from the law as a covenant of life, yet thou still art under the
law to Christ; and it is to be received by thee as out of his hand, to be a rule for thy conversation
in the world. (1 Cor. 9:18) What then thou art about to do, do it or leave it undone, as thou
shalt find it approved or forbidden by the law. And when ought shall come into thy mind to
be done, and thou art at a stand, and at a loss about the lawfulness or unlawfulness thereof,
then betake thyself to the law of thy God, which is in thy hand, and ask if this thing be good
or to be avoided. If this were practised by professors, there would not be so much iniquity
found in their beds, their houses, their shops, and their conversations, as there is.

Advice Second, As thou must be careful to find out the lawfulness or unlawfulness of a thing
before thou puttest forth thy hand thereto, so thou must also consider again whether that which
is lawful is expedient. A thing may be lawful in itself, and may yet be unlawful to thee; to
wit, if there be an inconveniency, or an inexpediency attending the doing of it. 'All things
are lawful unto me,' says the apostle, 'but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful
for me, but all things edify not.' (1 Cor. 6:12; 10:23) This then thou must consider, and this
also thou must practise.

But this is a hard lesson, and impossible to be done, except thou art addicted to self-denial;
for this text, and so the practice of what is contained therein, has respect chiefly to another,
to wit, to thy neighbour, and his advantage and edification; and it supposeth, yea, enjoineth
thee, if thou wilt depart from iniquity, to forbear also some things that are lawful, and consequently
profitable to thee, for the sake of, and of love to, thy neighbour. But how little of this
is found among men? Where is the man that will forbear some lawful things, for fear of hurting
the weak thereby? Alas! how many are there that this day profess, that will not forbear palpable
wickedness; no, though the salvation of their own souls are endangered thereby; and how then
should these forbear things that are lawful, even of godly tenderness to the weakness of their
neighbour?

Thus much have I thought good to speak in answer to this question, What iniquity should we
depart from that religiously name the name of Christ? And now we will make some use of what
hath been spoken.

USE FIRST. And the first shall be a use of examination. Art thou a professor? Dost thou religiously
name the name of Christ? If so, I ask, dost thou, according to the exhortation here, 'Depart
from iniqnity?' I say, examine thyself about this matter, and be thou faithful in this work,
for the deceit in this will fall upon thine own pate. Deceive thyself thou mayest, but beguile
God thou shalt not. 'Be not deceived, God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that
shall he also reap.' (Gal. 6:7) Wherefore let no man deceive himself, either in professing
while he lives viciously, or in examining whether his profession of this name, and his life,
and conversation, do answer one another. What departing from iniquity is, I have already showed
in the former part of this book; wherefore I shall not here handle that point farther, only
press upon thee the necessity of this exhortation, and the danger of the not doing of it faithfully.
The necessity of it is urged,

First, From the deceitfulness of man's heart which will flatter him with promises of peace
and life, both now and hereafter, though he live in iniquity while he professeth the name of
Christ. 29:19) And what will become of them that so do, you may see by that which followeth
in the text. The heart therefore is not to be trusted, for it will promise a man peace in the
way of death and damnation. I doubt not but many are under this fearful judgment to this day.
What means else their quietness of mind, their peace and boasts of heaven and glory, though
every step they take, as to life and conversation, is an apparent step to hell and damnation,
'The heart is deceitful.' (Jer. 17:9) and, 'He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.' (Prov.
28:26) These sayings were not written without a cause. Let as many, therefore, as would examine
themselves about this matter, have a jealous eye over their own heart, and take heed of being
beguiled thereby; let them mix hearty prayer with this matter unto God, that he will help them
to be faithful to themselves in this so great a matter; yea, let them compare their lives with
the holy commandment, and judge by that rather than by the fleshly fondness that men naturally
are apt to have for, and of, their own actions; for by the verdict of the Word thou must stand
and fall, both now, at death, and in the day of judgment. Take heed, therefore, of thy heart,
thy carnal heart, when thou goest into thy life, to make a search for iniquity. Take the Word
with thee, and by the Word do thou examine thyself. (John 12:48)

Second, It is urged from the cunning of Satan. Wouldest thou examine thyself faithfully as
to this thing, then take heed of the flatteries of the devil: can he help it, thou shalt never
find out the iniquity of thy heels. He will labour to blind thy mind, to harden thy heart,
to put such virtuous names upon thy foulest vices, that thou shalt never, unless thou stoppest
thine ear to him, after a godly sort, truly examine and try thy ways, according as thou art
commanded. (Lam. 3:40; 2 Cor. 13:5) Wherefore take heed of him, for he will be ready at thy
side when thou goest about this work. Now for thy help in this matter, set God, the holy God,
the all-seeing God, the sin--revenging God, before thine eyes; 'for our God is a consuming
fire.' (Heb. 12:29) And believe that he hath pitched his eyes upon thy heart; also that 'he
pondereth all thy goings,' and that thy judgment, as to thy faithfulness, or unfaithfulness,
in this work, must proceed out of the mouth of God. (Prov. 5:21; 21:2) This will be thy help
in this thing, that is, if thou usest it faithfully; also this will be thy hindrance, if thou
shalt neglect it, and suffer thyself to be abused by the devil.

Third, It is urged from the dangerousness of the latter days. Wouldst thou examine thyself,
then make not the lives of others any rule to thee in this matter. It is prophesied long ago,
by Christ and by Paul, concerning the latter times, 'that iniquity shall abound, and be very
high among professors.' (Matt. 24:12; 2 Tim. 3:1-8) Therefore it will be a rare thing to find
an exemplary life among professors. Wherefore cease from man, and learn of the Word, try thyself
by the Word, receive conviction from the Word; and to take off thyself from taking of encouragement
from others, set the judgment before thine eyes, and that account that God will demand of thee
then; and know that it will be but a poor excuse of thee to say, Lord, such a one doth so,
did so, would do so: and they professed, &c. Whether thou wilt hear me or not, I know not,
yet this I know, 'If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou
alone shalt bear it.' (Prov. 9:12)

Let me then, to press this use further upon thee, show thee in a few particulars the danger
of not doing of it, that is, of not departing from iniquity, since thou professest.

Danger 1. The iniquity that cleaveth to men that profess, if they cast it not away, but countenance
it, will a11 prove nettles and briars to them; and I will assure thee, yea, thou knowest, that
nettles and thorns will sting and scratch but ill-favouredly. 24:30, 31)

Suppose a man were, after work all day, to be turned into a bed of nettles at night: or after
a man had been about such a business, should be rewarded with chastisements of briars and thorns:
this would for work be but little help, relief, or comfort to him; why this is the reward of
a wicked man, of a wicked professor from God; nettles and thorns are to cover over the face
of his vineyard, his field, his profession, and that at the last of all; for this covering
over the face of his vineyard, with nettles and thorns, is to show what fruit the slovenly,
slothful, careless professor, will reap out; of his profession, when reaping time shall come.

Nor can he whose vineyard, whose profession is covered over with these nettles and thorns of
iniquity, escape being afflicted with them in his conscience: for look as they cover the face
of his vineyard through his sloth now, so will they cover the face of his conscience, in the
day of judgment. For profession and conscience cannot be separated long; if a man then shall
make profession without conscience of God's honour in his conversation, his profession and
conscience will meet in the day of his visitation. Nor will he, whose condition this shall
be, be able to ward off the guilt and sting of a slothful and bad conversation, from covering
the face of his conscience, by retaining in his profession the name of Jesus Christ: for naming
and professing of the name of Christ will, instead of salving such a conscience, put venom,
sting, and keenness into those nettles and thorns, that then shall be spread over the face
of such consciences. This will be worse than was that cold wet cloth that Hazael took and spread
over the face of Benhadad, that he died. (2 Kings 8:15) This will sting worse, tear worse,
torment worse, kill worse. Therefore look to it!

Danger 2. Nor may men shift this danger by their own neglect of inquiring into the truth of
their separation from iniquity, for that God himself will search them. I search the reins and
the heart, saith he, 'to give unto every one of you according to your works.' (Rev. 2:23)

There are many that wear the name of Christ for a cloak, and so make their advantages by their
iniquity; but Christ, at death and judgment, will rend this cloak from off such shoulders,
then shall they walk naked, yea, the shame of their nakedness shall then appear. Now since
no man can escape the search of God, and so, not his judgment; it will be thy wisdom to search
thine own ways, and to prevent judgment by judging of thyself.

Danger 3. Christ will deny those to be his that do not depart from iniquity, though they shall
name his name among the rest of his people. 'Depart from me,' saith he, 'all you that departed
not from iniquity.' (Luke 13:25-27) Yea, they that shall name his name religiously, and not
depart from iniquity, are denied by him all along. 1. He alloweth them not now to call him
Lord. 'And why call ye me Lord, Lord,' saith he, 'and do not, the things which I say?' (Luke
6:46) He cannot abide to be reputed the Lord of those that presume to profess his name, and
do not depart from iniquity. (Ezek. 20:39) The reason is, for that such do but profane his
name, and stave others off from falling in love with him and his ways. Hence he says again
'Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, that my name shall no more be named
in the mouth of any man of Judah.' (Jer. 44:26; Rom. 2:24) 2. He regardeth not their prayers.
3. He will not regard their soul, but at the last day will cast it from him, as a thing abhorred
by him. As is evidently seen by that thirteenth of Luke, but now noted above.

Wherefore, from these few hints, thou, whoever thou art, mayest well perceive what a horrible
thing it is to make a profession of the name of Christ, and not to depart from iniquity. Therefore
let me exhort thee again to examine thyself, if thou hast, and dost--since thou professest
that name--depart from iniquity.

And here I would distinguish, for there is two parts in iniquity, to wit, the guilt and filth.
As for the guilt that is contracted by iniquity, I persuade myself, no man who knows it, needs
to be bid to desire to depart from that; nay, I do believe that the worst devil in hell would
depart from his guilt, if he could, and might: but this is it, to wit, to depart from the sweet,
the pleasure, and profit of iniquity. There are that call evil good, iniquity good, and that
of professors too: this is that to be departed from, and these are they that are exhorted to
forsake it upon the pains and penalties before threatened. Therefore, as I said, let such look
to it, that they examine themselves if they depart from iniquity.

And come, now thou art going about this work, let me help thee in this matter. I. Ask thy heart,
What evil dost thou see in sin? II. How sick art thou of sin? III. What means dust thou use
to mortify thy sins? IV. How much hast thou been grieved to see others break God's law, and
to find temptations in thyself to do it?

I. For the first, There is a soul-polluting evil in iniquity. There is a God-provoking evil
in iniquity.

There is a soul-damning evil in iniquity. And until thou comest experimentally to know these
things, thou wilt have neither list, nor will, to depart from iniquity.

II. For the second. I mean not sick with guilt, for so the damned in hell are sick, but I mean
sick of the filth, and polluting nature of it. Thus was Moses sick of sin, thus Jabez was sick
of sin, and thus was Paul sick of sin. (Num. 11:14, 15; 1 Chron. 4:9, 10; Rom. 7:14; 2 Cor.
5:1-3; Phil. 3:10-14)

III. For the third. You know that those that are sensible of a sickness, will look out after
the means to be recovered; there is a means also for this disease, and dost thou know what
that means is, and hast thou indeed a desire to it? yea, couldest thou be willing even now
to partake of the means that would help thee to that means, that can cure thee of this disease?
there are no means can cure a man that is sick of sin, but glory; and the means to come by
that is Christ, and to go out of this world by the faith of him. There is no grace can cure
this disease; yes, grace doth rather increase it; for the more grace any man has, the more
is he sick of sin; the greater an offence is iniquity to him. So then, there is nothing can
cure this disease, but glory: but immortal glory. And dost thou desire this medicine? and doth
God testify that thy desire is true, not feigned? (2 Cor. 5:4) I know that there are many things
that do make some even wish to die: but the question is not whether thou dost wish to die:
for death can cure many diseases: but is this that that moveth thee to desire to depart: to
wit, that thou mightest be rid, quite rid, and stripped of a body of death, because nothing
on this side the grave can rid thee and strip thee of it. And is hope, that this day is approaching,
a reviving cordial to thee? and doth the hope of this strike arrows into the heart of thy lusts,
and draw off thy mind and affections yet farther from iniquity.

IV. To the fourth. 'I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved,' said David, 'because men
kept not thy word.' (Psa. 119:158) The same also had Paul, because of that body of sin and
death which was in him. Professor, I beseech thee be thou serious about this thing because
it will be found, when God comes to judge, that those that profess Christ, and yet abide with
their iniquity, are but wooden, earthy professors, and none of the silver or golden ones: and
so, consequently, such as shall be vessels, not to honour, but to dishonour; not to glory,
but to shame.

USE SECOND. My next shall be a use of terror. Has God commanded by the mouth of his holy apostles
and prophets, that those that name the name of Christ should depart from iniquity: then what
will become of those that rebel against his Word. Where the word of a king is, there is power;
and if the wrath of a king be as the roaring of a lion, what is, and what will be the wrath
of God, when with violence it falls upon the head of the wicked?

Sirs, I beseech you consider this, namely, that the man that professeth the name of Christ,
and yet liveth a wicked life, is the greatest enemy that God has in the world, and, consequently,
one that God, in a way most eminent, will set his face against. Hence he threateneth such so
hotly, saying, 'And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinner shall be together,'
and that 'they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed.' (Isa. 1:28; 33:14) But what sinners
are these? why, the sinners in Zion, the hypocrites in the church. So again the Lord shall
'purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against him.' (Ezek. 20:38)
'All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which say, The evil shall not overtake
nor prevent us.' (Amos 9:10) For though such do think that by professing of the name of Christ,
they shall prevent their going down to hell, yet they shall go down thither, with those that
have lived openly wicked and profane: Egypt, and Judah, the circumcised with them that are
not, for it is not a profession of faith that can save them. (Jer. 9:26) 'Whom dost thou pass
in beauty,' saith God? wherein art thou bettered by the profession, than the wicked? 'go down,
and be thou laid with the uncircumcised.' (Ezek. 32:19)

This in general; but more particularly, the wrath of God manifesteth itself against such kind
of professors. In that the gospel and means of salvation shall not be effectual for their salvation,
but that it shall work rather quite contrary effects. It shall bring forth, as I said, quite
contrary effects. (2 Cor. 2:15, 16) As,

First, The preaching of the Word shall be to such the savour of death unto death, and that
is a fearful thing.

Second, Yea Christ Jesus himself shall be so far off from being a savour unto them, that he
shall be a snare, a trap and a gin to catch them by the heel withal; that they may go and fall
backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.' (Isa. 8:14, 15; 28:13)

Third, The Lord also will choose out such delusions, or such as will best suit with the workings
of their flesh, as will effectually bring them down, with the bullocks and with the bulls to
the slaughter: yea, he will lead such forth with the workers of iniquity. (Isa. 66:3, 4; Psa.
125:5)

Fourth, Such, above all, lie open to the sin against the Holy Ghost, that unpardonable sin,
that must never be forgiven. For alas, it is not the poor ignorant world, but the enlightened
professor that committeth the sin that shall never be forgiven.

I say, it is one enlightened, one that has tasted the good word of God, and something of the
powers of the world to come. (Heb. 6:4; 1 John 5:16) It is one that was counted a brother,
that was with us in our profession: it is such an one that is in danger of committing of that
most black and bloody sin. But yet all and every one of those that are such are not in danger
of this; but those among these that take pleasure in unrighteousness, and that rather than
they will lose that pleasure, will commit it presumptuously. Presumptuously, that is, against
light, against convictions, against warnings, against mercies. Or thus, a presumptuous sin
is such an one as is committed in the face of the command, in a desperate venturing to run
the hazard, or in a presuming upon the mercy of God, through Christ, to be saved not withstanding:
this is a leading sin to that which is unpardonable, and will be found with such professors;
that do hanker after iniquity. I say, it is designed by the devil, and suffered by the just
judgment of God, to catch and overthrow the loose and carnal gospellers. And hence it is that
David cries unto God, that he would hold him back from these sort of sins. 'Cleanse thou me
from secret faults,' says he. And then adds, 'Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous
sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent
from the great transgression.' (Psa. 19:12, 13)

If there were any dread of God, or of his word, in the hearts of the men of this generation,
the consideration of this one test is enough to shake them in pieces: I speak of those that
name the name of Christ, but do not depart from iniquity. But the word of God must be fulfilled;
in the last days iniquity must abound; wherefore these days will be perilous and dangerous
to professors. 'In the last days perilous times shall come, for men shall be lovers of their
ownselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.'
(2 Tim. 3:1, 2; Matt. 24:12) I do the oftener harp upon this test at this time, because it
is a prediction of what shall be in the latter days, to wit, what a sea and deluge of iniquity
shall in the latter days overspread and drown those that then shall have a form of godliness,
and of religion. So that this day is more dangerous than were the days that have been before
us. Now iniquity, even immorality, shall with professors be in fashion, be pleaded for, be
loved and more esteemed than holiness itself. Now therefore ministers must not think that what
they say of the doctrine of self denial among professors, will be much, if at all regarded.
I say, regarded, so as to be loved and put in practice by them that name the name of Christ.
For the strong hold that iniquity shall have of their affections will cause that but little
effectualness to this end will be found to attend the preaching of the Word unto them.

But what will these kind of men do, when God that is just, God that is holy, and God that is
strong to execute his word, shall call them to an account for these things?

Now some may say, But what shall we do to depart from iniquity? I answer,

1. Labour to see the odiousness and unprofitableness thereof, which thou mayest do by the true
knowledge of the excellent nature of the holiness of God. For until thou seest a beauty in
holiness, thou canst not see odiousness in sin and iniquity. Danger thou mayest see in sin
before, but odiousness thou canst not.

2. Be much in the consideration of the power, justice, and faithfulness of God to revenge himself
on the workers of iniquity.

3. Be much in the consideration of the greatness and worth of thy soul.

4. Be often asking of thyself what true profit did I ever get by the commission of any sin.

5. Bring thy last day often to thy bedside.

6. Be often thinking of the cries and roarings of the damned in hell.

7. Be often considering the lastingness of the torments of hell.

8. Be often thinking what would those that are now in hell give that they might live their
lives over again.

9. Consider often of the frailty of thy life, and that there is no repentance to be found in
the grave, whither thou goest.

10. Consider that hell is a doleful place, and that the devils are but uncomfortable companions.

11. Again, consider together with those how the patience of God has been abused by thee; yea,
how all his attributes have been despised by thee, who art a professor, that does not depart
from iniquity.

13. Moreover, I would ask with what face thou canst look the Lord Jesus in the face, whose
name thou hast profaned by thine iniquity?

13. Also, how thou wilt look on those that are truly godly, whose hearts thou has grieved,
while they have beheld the dirt and dung that hath cloven to thee and to thy profession.

14. But especially consider with thyself how thou wilt bear, together with thine own, the guilt,
of the damnation of others. For as I have often said, a professor, if he perishes, seldom perishes
alone, but casteth others down to hell with himself. The reason is, because others, both weak
professors and carnal men, are spectators and observers of his ways; yea, and will presume
also to follow him especially in evil courses, concluding that he is right. We read that the
tail of the dragon, or that the dragon by his tail, did draw and cast down abundance of the
stars of heaven to the earth. (Rev. 12:4; Isa. 9:14, 15) The tail! 'The prophet that teacheth
lies, he is the tail.' The prophet that speaketh lies, either by opinion or practice, he is
the tail, the dragons's tail, the serpentine tail of the devil. (Isa. 9:14, 15) And so in his
order, every professor that by his iniquity draweth both himself and others to hell, he is
the tail. The tail, says the Holy Ghost, draws them down; draws down even the stars of heaven;
but whither doth he draw them? The answer is, from heaven, the throne of God, to earth, the
seat of the dragon; for he is the god of this world. The professor then that is dishonourable
in his profession, he is the tail. 'The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet
that teacheth lies, he is the tail.' Nor can Satan work such exploits by any, as he can by
unrighteous professors. These he useth in his hand, as the giant useth his club; he, as it
were, drives all before him with it. It is said of Behemoth, that 'he moveth his tail like
a cedar.' (Job 40:7) Behemoth is a type of the devil, but behold how he handleth his tail,
even as if a man should swing about a cedar. (Rev. 9:10, 19) This is spoken to shew the hurtfulness
of the tail, as it is also said in another place. Better no professor than a wicked professor.
Better open profane than a hypocritical namer of the name of Christ; and less hurt shall such
an one do to his own soul, to the poor ignorant world, to the name of Christ, and to the church
of God.

Let professors, therefore, take heed to themselves, that they join to their naming of the name
of Christ an holy and godly conversation; for away they must go else with the workers of iniquity
to the pit, with more guilt, and bigger load, and more torment by far than others, But,

USE THIRD. My next word shall be to those that desire to be true, sincere professors of the
name of Christ.

First, Do you bless God, for that he has put not only his name into your lips, but grace into
your hearts, that thereby that profession which thou makest of him may be seasoned with that
salt. 'Every sacrifice shall be seasoned with salt.' (Mark 9:49) Now naming of the name of
Christ is a sacrifice, and a sacrifice acceptable, when the salt of the covenant of thy God
is not lacking, but mixed therewith. (Heb. 13:15; Lev. 2:13) Therefore I say, since God has
put his name into thy mouth to profess the same, and grace into thy heart to season that profession
with such carriage, such behaviour, such life, and such conversation as doth become the same,
thou hast great cause to thank God. A man into whose mouth God has put the name of Christ to
profess it, is as a man that is to act his part upon a stage in the market place; if he doth
it well, he brings praise both to his master and himself; but if he doth it ill, both are brought
into contempt. No greater praise can by man be brought to God, than by joining to the profession
of the name of Christ a fruitful life and conversation. 'Herein,' saith Christ, 'is my Father
glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.' (John 15:8) Fruitful lives
God expecteth of all that profess the name of Christ. And let every one that nameth the name
of Christ depart from iniquity. Bless God, therefore, if he hath kept thee from blotting and
blemishing of thy profession; if thy conversation has not been stained with the blots and evils
of the times. What thou feelest, fightest with, and groanest under, by reason of the working
of thine inward corruptions, with that I meddle not; nor is thy conversation the worse for
that, if thou keepest them from breaking out. Thou also shalt be counted holy unto God, through
Christ, if thou be of an upright conversation; though plagued every day with the working of
thine own corruption.

Ad God's grace is the salt of saints, so saints are the salt of God. The one is the salt of
God in the heart, and the other is the salt of God in the world. 'Ye are the salt of the earth:'
(Matt. 5:13) that is the salt of God in the earth. For the earth would be wholly corrupt, and
would altogether stink, if professors were not in it. But now if the professor, which is the
salt, shall indeed lose his savour, and hath nothing in his conversation to season that part
of the earth, in which God has placed him, wherewith shall it be seasoned? The place where
he dwells, as well as his profession, will both stink odiously in the nostrils of the Lord,
and so both come to ruin and desolation.

Indeed, as I have shewed, the professor will come to the worst of it; for that God doth deny
further to give him salt. 'If the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?'
(Luke 14:34) Wherewith shall the salt be salted? with nothing. Therefore it is thenceforth
good for nothing. No, not for the dunghill, but to be cast out, and trodden under foot of men.
'He that hath ears to hear let him hear.'

How much, therefore, is the tender-hearted, and he that laboureth to beautify his profession
with a gospel conversation, bound to bless God for the salt of his grace, by the which his
heart is seasoned, and from his heart, his conversation.

Second, As such Christians should bless God, so let them watch, let them still watch, let them
still watch and pray, watch against Satan, and pray yet for more grace, that they may yet more
and more beautify their profession of the worthy name of Christ with a suitable conversation.
Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garment; that is, his conversation clean, nor is
there anything, save the overthrowing of our faith, that Satan seeketh more to destroy. He
knows holiness in them that rightly, as to doctrine, name the name of Christ, is a maul and
destruction to his kingdom, an allurement to the ignorant, and a cutting off those occasions
to stumble, that by the dirty life of a professor is laid in the way of the blind. (Lev. 19:14)
He knows that holiness of lives, when they shine in those that profess the name of Christ,
doth cut off his lies that he seeketh to make the world believe, and slanders that he seeketh
to fasten upon the professors of the gospel. Wherefore, as you have begun to glorify God in
your body and in your spirit, which are God's; so I beseech you do it more and more. 6:5; 2
Tim. 2:22) If a man, if a good man takes not good heed to himself, he shall soon bring his
soul into a snare. Loose professors are defilers and corrupters; a man shall get nothing but
a blot by having company with them. (Isa. 1:4) Besides, as a man shall get a blot by having
much to do with such; so let him beware that his heart learn none of their ways. Let thy company
be the excellent in the earth even those that are excellent for knowledge and conversation.
'He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.'

Be content to be counted singular, for so thou shalt, if thou shalt follow after righteousness,
&., in good earnest; for holiness is a rare thing now in the world. I told thee before that
it is foretold by the Word, that in the last days perilous times shall come, and that men shall
walk after their own lusts; yea, professors, to their destruction. Nor will it be easy to keep
thyself therefrom. But even as when the pestilence is come into a place, it infecteth and casteth
down the healthful; so the iniquity of the last times will infest and pollute the godly. I
mean the generality of them. Were but our times duly compared with those that went before,
we should see that which now we are ignorant of. Did we but look back to the Puritans, but
especially to those that, but a little before them, suffered for the word of God, in the Marian
days, we should see another life than is now among men, another manner of conversation than
now is among professors. But, I say, predictions and prophecies must be fulfilled; and since
the Word says plainly, that 'in the last days there shall come scoffers, walking after their
own lusts,' (2 Peter 3:17) and since the Christians shall be endangered thereby, let us look
to it, that we acquit ourselves like men, seeing we know these things before; 'lest we, being
led away with the error of the wicked, fall from our own steadfastness.'

Singularity in godliness, if it be in godliness, no man should be ashamed of. For that is no
more than to be more godly, than to walk more humbly with God than others; and, for my part,
I had rather be a pattern and example of piety. I had rather that my life should be instructing
to the saints, and condemning to the world, with Noah and Lot, than to hazard myself among
the multitude of the drossy.

I know that many professors will fall short of eternal life, and my judgment tells me, that
they will be of the slovenly sort of professors that so do. And for my part, I had rather run
with the foremost and win the prize, than come behind, and lose that, and my labour, and all.
'If a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.' And
when men have said all they can, they are the truly redeemed 'that are zealous of good works.'
(1 Cor. 9:24; 2 Tim. 2:4, 5; Titus 2:14)

Not that works do save us, but faith, which layeth hold on Christ's righteousness for justification,
sanctifies the heart, and makes men desirous to live in this world, to the glory of that Christ
who died in this world to save us from death.

For my part I doubt of the faith of many, and fear that it will prove no better at the day
of God than will the faith of devils. For that it standeth in bare speculation, and is without
life and soul to that which is good. Where is the man that walketh with his cross upon his
shoulder? Where is the man that is zealous of moral holiness? Indeed, for those things that
have nothing of the cross of the purse, or of the cross of the belly, or of the cross of the
back, or of the cross of the vanity of household affairs; for those things, I find we have
many, and those, very busy sticklers; but otherwise, the cross, self denial, charity, purity
in life and conversation, is almost quite out of doors among professors. But, man of God, do
thou be singular as to these and as to their conversation. 'Be not ye therefore partakers with
them,' (Eph. 5:7), in any of their ways, but keep thy soul diligently; for if damage happeneth
to thee, thou alone must bear it.

But he that will depart from iniquity must be well fortified with faith, and patience, and
the love of God; for iniquity has its beauty spots and its advantages attending on it; hence
it is compared to a woman, for it allureth greatly. (Zech. 5:7) Wherefore, I say, he that will
depart therefrom had need have faith, that being it which will help him to see beyond it, and
that will shew him more in things that are invisible, that can be found in sin, were it ten
thousand times more entangling than it is. (2 Cor. 4:18) He has need of patience also to hold
out in this work of departing from iniquity. For, indeed, to depart from that, is to draw my
mind off from that, which will follow me with continual solicitations. Samson withstood his
Delilah for a while, but she got the mastery of him at the last; why so? Because he wanted
patience, he grew angry and was vexed, and could withstand her solicitation no longer. (Judges
16:15-17) Many there be also, that can well enough be contented to shut sin out of doors for
a while; but because sin has much fair speech, therefore it overcomes at last. (Prov. 7:21)
For sin and iniquity will not be easily said nay; it is like her of whom you read--she has
a whore's forehead, and refuses to be ashamed. (Jer. 3:3) Wherefore, departing from iniquity
is a work for length, as long as life shall last. A work did I say? It is a war; a continual
combat; wherefore he that will adventure to set upon this work must needs be armed with faith
and patience, a daily exercise he will find himself put upon by the continual attempts of iniquity
to be putting forth itself. (Matt. 24:13; Rev. 3:10) This is called an enduring to the end,
a continuing in the word of Christ and also a keeping of the word of his patience. But what
man in the world can do this whose heart is not seasoned with the love of God and the love
of Christ? Therefore, he that will exercise himself in this work must be often considering
of the love of God to him in Christ; for the more sense, or apprehension, a man shall have
of that, the more easy and pleasant will this work be to him: yea, though the doing thereof
should cost him his heart's blood. 'Thy loving-kindness is before mine eyes,' says David, 'and
I have walked in thy truth.' (Psa. 26:3) Nothing like the sense, sight, or belief of that,
to the man of God, to make him depart from iniquity.

But what shall I do, I cannot depart therefrom as I should?

Keep thine eye upon all thy shortnesses, or upon all thy failures, for that that is profitable
for thee. 1. The sight of this will make thee base in thine own eyes. 2. It will give thee
occasion to see the need and excellency of repentance. 3. It will put thee upon prayer to God
for help and pardon. 4. It will make thee weary of this world. 5. It will make grace to persevere
the more desirable in thine eyes.

Also, it will help thee in the things which follow:--l. It will make thee see the need of Christ's
righteousness. 2. It will make thee see the need of Christ's intercession. 3. It will make
thee see thy need of Christ's advocateship. 4. It will make thee see the riches of God's patience.
5. And it will make heaven and eternal life the sweeter to thee when thou comest there.

But to the question. Get more grace, for the more grace thou hast the further is thine heart
set off of iniquity, the more, also, set against it, and the better able to depart from it
when it cometh to thee, tempteth thee, and entreats thee for entertainment. Now the way to
have more grace is to have more knowledge of Christ, and to pray more fervently in his name;
also, to subject thy soul and thy lusts, with all thy power, to the authority of that grace
thou hast, and to judge and condemn thyself most heartily before God, for every secret inclination
that thou findest in thy flesh to sinward.

The improvement of what thou hast is that, as I may say, by which God judges how thou wouldest
use, if thou had it, more; and according to that so shalt thou have, or not have, a farther
measure. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful, and will be so, also in much;
and he that is unjust in the least, is, and will be, unjust also in much. I know Christ speaks
here about the unrighteous mammon, but the same may be applied also unto the thing in hand.
(Luke 16:10-12)

And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will commit unto you that
which is your own? That is a remarkable place to this purpose in the Revelation--'Behold,'
saith he, 'I have set before thee an open door,' that thou mayest have what thou wilt, as was
also said to the improving woman of Canaan, 'and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little
strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.' (Rev. 3:8; Matt. 15:28)

A good improvement of what we have of the grace of God at present pleases God, and engages
him to give us more; but an ill improvement of what we at present have will not do so. 'To
him that hath,' that hath an heart to improve what he hath, to him shall be given; but to him
that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he hath.' (Matt. 25:24-30) Well, weigh
the place and you shall find it so. And it is well for thee if thy complaint be sincere, to
wit, that thou art troubled that thou canst not forsake iniquity as thou shouldest; for God
accepteth of thy design and desire, and it is counted by him as thy kindness. (Prov. 19:22)
But if thy complaint in this matter be true, thou wilt not rest nor content thyself in thy
complaints, but wilt, as he that is truly hungry or greatly burdened useth all lawful means
to satisfy his hunger and to ease himself of his burden, use all thy skill and power to mortify
and keep them under, by the word of God. Nor can it otherwise be but that such a man must be
a growing man. 'Every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more
fruit' (John 15:2) Such a man shall not be a stumbling in religion, nor a scandal to it, in
his calling; but shall, according to God's ordinary way with his people, be a fruitful and
flourishing bough.

And I would to God this were the sickness of all them that profess in this nation; for then
should we soon have a new leaf turned over in most corners of this nation; then would graciousness
of heart, and life, and conversation be more prized, more sought after, and better improved
and practised than it is; yea, then would the throats of ungodly men be better stopt, and their
mouths faster shut up, as to their reproaching of religion, than they are. A Christian man
must be the object of the envy of the world; but it is better, if the will of God be so, that
we be reproached for well-doing than for evil. (1 Peter 2:3) If we be reproached for evil-doing,
it is our shame; but if for well-doing, it is our glory. If we be reproached for our sins,
God cannot vindicate us; but if we be reproached for a virtuous life, God himself is concerned,
will espouse our quarrel, and, in his good time, will shew our foes our righteousness, and
put them to shame and silence. Briefly, a godly life annexed to faith in Christ is so necessary,
that a man that professes the name of Christ is worse than a beast without it.

But thou wilt say unto me, Why do men profess the name of Christ that love not to depart from
iniquity? I answer, there are many reasons for it. 1. The preaching of the gospel, and so the
publication of the name of Christ, is musical and very taking to the children of men. A Saviour!
a Redeemer! a loving, sin-pardoning Jesus! what better words can come from man? what better
melody can be heard? 'Son of man,' said God to the prophet, 'Lo, thou art unto them as a very
lovely song'; or, as a song of loves, 'of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can play well
on an instrument.' (Ezek. 33:32) The gospel is a most melodious note and sweet tune to any
that are not prepossessed with slander, reproach, and enmity against the professors of it.
Now, its melodious notes being so sweet, no marvel if it entangle some even of them that yet
will not depart from iniquity to take up and profess so lovely a profession. But,

2. There are a generation of men that are and have been frightened with the law, and terrified
with fears of perishing for their sins, but yet have not grace to leave them. Now, when the
sound of the gospel shall reach such men's ears, because there is by that made public the willingness
of Christ to die for sin, and of God to forgive them for his sake; therefore they presently
receive and profess those notions as the only ones that can rid them from their frights and
terrors, falsely resting themselves content with that faith thereof which standeth in naked
knowledge; yea, liking of that faith best that will stand with their pride, covetousness, and
lechery, never desiring to hear of practical holiness, because it will disturb them; wherefore
they usually cast dirt at such, calling them legal preachers.

3. Here also is a design of Satan set on foot; for these carnal gospellers are his tares, the
children of the wicked one; those that he hath sowed among the wheat of purpose, if possible,
that that might be rooted up by beholding and learning to be vile and filthy of them. (Matt.
13:36-43)

4. Another cause hereof is this, the hypocrites that begin to profess find as bad as themselves
already in a profession of this worthy name; and, think they, these do so and so, and, therefore,
so will I.

5. This comes to pass, also, through the righteous judgment of God, who, through the anger
that he has conceived against some men for their sins, will lift them up to heaven before he
casts them down to hell, that their fall may be the greater and their punishment the more intolerable.
(Matt. 11:20-24) I have now done when I have read to you my text over again--'And, let every
one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.'

Advertisement by the Editor

This valuable practical treatise, was first published as a pocket volume about the year 1674,
soon after the author's final release from his long and dangerous imprisonment. It is evident
from the concluding paragraph that he considered his liberty and even his life to be still
in a very uncertain state; not from the infirmities of age, for he was then in the prime of
life; but from the tyranny of the government, and probably from the effects of his long incarceration
in a damp, unhealthy jail. It is the best and most scriptural guide that has ever appeared
to aid us in the performance of relative duties: written with originality of thought and that
peculiar and pious earnestness which so distinguishes all his works.

No one can read this book, without finding in it his own portrait truly and correctly drawn
to the life. Many have been the hearers of the word in its public ministration, who have been
astonished that a faithful minister has not only opened their outward conduct, but the inward
recesses of their heartsand have inquired with wonder, 'Where could he get such a knowledge
of my heart?' The usages and feelings of every part of the human family the rich and poor outward
professors or openly profane God fearers or God defiersare displayed in the following pages
as accurately as if the author had been present in every family upon earth, and had not only
witnessed the conduct of the happy and of the miserable in every grade; but he goes within
and unvails that mystery of iniquity the human heart, its secret springs, feelings, and machinations.
What mysterious power could this uneducated man have possessed, thus to dive into the most
subtle of all secret repositories, the human heart! Could he have left his body at times and
his invisible spirit have entered all chambers, as was said of an ancient philosopher, 1 still
time would have been too short even to have transiently surveyed outward conduct; and then
he could not have entered into the thoughts of others. Reader, the fountain of all hidden things
was open to him. Shut up for many years in prison, with the key in his possession which unlocks
all the mysteries of earth, and heaven, and hellhe diligently used his time and all was revealed
to him. He makes the source of his knowledge no secret, but invites you to search, as he did,
this storehouse of things new and old. It was the Bible which unfolded to him all the great
events of time and of eternity all the secret springs of states, and families, and individuals
wonderous book! It made an uneducated artizan wiser than all the philosophers who have been
contented with Plato, Aristotle, Pliny, Plutarch, and the most renowned of human writers. Not
only is the real state of human nature revealed with unerring truth, as suffering under a cruel
malady, strangely diverse in its operations, but all tending to the downward, dark, dreary
road to misery temporal and eternal: but it also displays the antidote; an infallible remedy
against all the subtilties of this tortuous disease. Reader, this treasure is in our hands.
How great is the responsibility. How blessed are those who with earnest prayer for divine illumination
read ponder and relying upon the aid of the Holy Spirit, understand and instantly obey the
sacred precepts which its pages unfold. Weigh well their nature and tendency, as Bunyan opens
them in this invaluable treatise. They lead step by step from darkness to light. It may be
a tempestuous passage in the dim twilight, as it was with him but it is safe and leads to the
fountain of happiness the source of blessedness the presence and smiles of God and the being
conformed to his image. In proportion as we are thus transformed in our minds, we shall be
able to fulfil all our duties and behavior as becometh Christians. We dare not seek to avoid
these duties because they are full of anxieties. Blessed are those who know and feel the ties
of church fellowship or the nearer union of husband and wife, that type of the mystical union
of Christ and his church. Happy are those who piously discharge parental and filial duties,
that figure of the relationship which the Almighty, in infinite condescension, owns between
him and his fallen but renewed creatures. Vows of celibacy disturb all the order and harmonies
of creation, and are fleshly, sensual, devilish. The unmarried are strangers to those delightful
or painful sensibilities which drive the soul to continual converse with God, either in heart-felt
praises or for divine assistance to glorify him in the discharge of domestic duties. They who
vow celibacy, fly in the face of the infinitely wise eternal, who said, 'It is not good for
man to be alone.' He sets up his puny antagonism to omnipotence. It is true, that in the prospect
of the desolations which were foretold by the Saviour and were about to be poured out upon
Jerusalem, 'for the present distress,' 'the short time' Paul advised, not commanded, a temporary
deviation from the order of naturelike an eclipse of the sun or moonfor a 'short time' which
no one could wish to be prolonged. We are bound, in the expectation of the divine approbation,
not to shrink from duties, but to seek wisdom to fulfil them; and in this little work we have
a scriptural guide to which we shall do well to take heed. It is a peculiarly solemn legacythe
author's ardent desire is thus expressed; 'Before I die [as the greatest of all the duties
he had to perform] let me provoke you to faith and holiness.' Be it our duty and privilege
to examine our conduct faithfully by those portions of holy writ, with which this treatise
is beautifully adorned. It was written in the prospect of sufferings and death, and yet how
serene was his soul. No cloud, no doubts or fears are seen; his legacy to us as well as to
those who survived him is, 'Love one another when I am deceased.' My labours of love to you
are limited to this world. 'Though there I shall rest from my labours, and be in paradise,
as through grace, I comfortably believe; yet it is not there but here I must do you good.'
Consider what he has advanced, and the scriptures by which every sentence is confirmed, and
may his concluding and fervent prayer be answered to our souls: 'The Lord give us understanding
in all things. Farewell.'

The Epistle to the Reader

Courteous Reader,

Having formerly writ some small matter touching the doctrine of faith, as justification by
grace through the faith of Christ's blood, &c., I do here, as the second to that doctrine,
present thee with a few lines touching good works, that I might, as at first I showed thee
the good and glory of the one, so now show thee the beauty and excellency of the other: for
though we are justified freely by grace through Christ before God (Rom 3:24, &c.); yet we are
justified before men by our works (James 2:18): nay, a life of holiness flowing from faith
in us that are saved by grace, it doth justify that grace before the world, that justifies
us before God (2 Cor 6:1,3; 9:12,13; 1 Peter 2:11,12).

I have not here only in general treated of this doctrine of good works, but particularly, after
some discourse about works flowing from faith, and what makes it truly and gospelly good, I
discourse of them as we stand under our several relations in this world among men.

As, The duty of the master of a family: Of the husband to his wife; and of hers to him: Of
the duty of parents to their children; and of children to their parents: Of masters also to
their servants; and of the servant again to his master: with a brief touch upon good neighbourhood;
and a discovery of covetousness, pride, and uncleanness, which are great obstructions to a
truly gospel conversation.

I know there are many that have treated of good works in large and learned discourses; but
I doubt all have not so gospelized their discourses as becomes them, and as the doctrine of
the grace of God calleth for. However, I thought it my duty to add this discourse to all that
are past; and that for these reasons.

1. To take away those aspersions that the adversaries cast upon our doctrineas also in the
days of Paulthat because we preach justification without works of the law; therefore they pretend
we plead for looseness of life: 'whose damnation is just' (Rom 3:8).

2. Because, though there be much discourse about works in general, yet a particular discourse
of them, as before is touched, is too much neglected; and by this means every one too much
left at uncertainties (as from them) of their several works under their particular relations;
which I think is one reason of that disorder in families and places where God's people live;
to their shame, and the dishonour of God.

3. Because these few books that do particularly treat thus of good works, are, I think, now
so scarce, or so big, that but few have them, and few buy them, if they may be had, especially
our new converts, for whose sakes principally this short discourse is intended; and indeed,
this is one reason of my brevity, that the price might neither be burdensome, nor the reading
long and tedious. Multitude of words drown the memory; and an exhortation in few words may
yet be so full, that the reader may find that in one side of a sheet, which some are forced
to hunt for in a whole book. The Lord teach us this wisdom.

4. I have written this book, to show that I bear a fellow-testimony and witness, with all that
know God, of the operation that grace hath, and will have, in the heart that hath savingly
received it.

Lastly, I have thus written, because it is amiable and pleasant to God, when Christians keep
their rank, relation, and station, doing all as becometh their quality and calling. 3 And seeing
the stock into which we are planted, is the fruitfullest stock, the sap conveyed thereout the
fruitfullest sap, and the dresser of our souls the wisest husbandman, (John 15:1) how contrary
to nature, to example, and expectation, should we be, if we should not be rich in good works!

Wherefore take heed of being painted fire, wherein is no warmth; and painted flowers, which
retain no smell; and of being painted trees, whereon is no fruit. 'Whoso boasteth himself of
a false gift, is like clouds and wind without rain' (Prov 25:14). Farewell.

The Lord be with thy spirit, that thou mayest profit for time to come.

J. BUNYAN.

I shall not at this time discourse of every particular at large included in these words; but
shall briefly fall upon those things that I judge most necessary for the people of God.

But yet, to prosecute what I intend, with what clearness I may, I shall in a word or two make
way for what is to be the main of this book. 'This is a faithful saying.' This; Which?

From this scripture, therefore, I do gather these things observable.

FIRST, That good works do flow from faith. Yea,

SECOND, That every one that believeth should be careful that their works be good.

THIRD, That every believer should not only be careful that their works be good, and for the
present do them, but should also be careful to maintain them; that is, they should carefully
study to keep in a constant course of good works. I begin with the first. That good works do
flow from faith. This is evident divers ways.

First, From the impossibility of their flowing from any other thing; they must either flow
from faith, or not at all: 'For whatsoever is not of faith, is sin' (Rom 14:23). And again,
'Without faith it is impossible to please him' (Heb 11:6). Now a man is made good by faith,
and by that bringeth forth the fruits that are acceptable to God (Heb 11:4; Col 1:4-6).

Wherefore sinners, before faith, are compared to the wilderness, whose fruits are briars and
thorns; and whose hearts are the habitation of dragons; that is, of devils 4 (Isa 35:6,7; Heb
6:7,8).

And hence again it is, that they are said to be Godless, Christless, Spiritless, faithless,
hopeless; without the covenant of grace, without strength; enemies in their minds by wicked
works, and possessed by the spirit of wickedness, as a castle by a conqueror (Eph 2:12; Jude
19; 2 Thess 3:2; Col 1:21; Luke 11:21).

Now, these things being thus, it is impossible that all the men under heaven, that are unconverted,
should be able to bring forth one work rightly good; even as impossible, as for all the briars
and thorns under heaven to bring forth one cluster of grapes, or one bunch of figs; for indeed
they want the qualification. A thorn bringeth not forth figs, because it wanteth the nature
of the fig-tree; and so doth the bramble the nature of the vine. Good works must come from
a good heart. Now, this the unbeliever wanteth, because he wanteth faith; for it is that which
purifieth the heart (Luke 6:45; Acts 15:9). Good works must come from love to the Lord Jesus;
but this the unbeliever wanteth also, because he wanteth faith: For faith 'worketh by love,'
and by that means doth good (Gal 5:6).

And hence again it is, that though the carnal man doth never so much which he calleth good,
yet it is rejected, slighted, and turned as dirt in his face again; his prayers are abominable
(Prov 15:8), his ploughing is sin (Prov 21:4), and all his righteousness as menstruous rags
(Isa 64:6).

Thus you see that without faith there are no good works.

Now then, to show you that they flow from faith: and that, For that FAITH is a principle of
life, by which a Christian lives (Gal 2:19,20), a principle of motion, by which it walks towards
heaven in the way of holiness (Rom 4:12; 2 Cor 5:7). It is also a principle of strength, by
which the soul opposeth its lust, the devil, and this world, and overcomes them. 'This is the
victory, even our faith' (1 John 5:4,5) Faith, in the heart of a Christian, is like the salt
that was thrown into the corrupt fountain, that made the naughty waters good, and the barren
land fruitful (2 Kings 2:19-22). Faith, when it is wrought in the heart, is like leaven hid
in the meal, (Matt 13:33) or like perfume that lighteth upon stinking leather, turning the
smell of the leather into the savour of the perfume; faith being then planted in the heart,
and having its natural inclination to holiness. Hence it is that there followeth an alteration
of the life and conversation, and so bringeth forth fruit accordingly. 'A good man out of the
good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good' (Luke 6:45). Which treasure,
I say, is this faith (James 2:5; 1 Peter 1:7). And therefore it is that faith is called 'the
faith according to godliness,' (Titus 1:1) and the 'most holy faith' (Jude 20).

Second, Good works must needs flow from faith, or no way; because that alone carrieth in it
an argument sufficiently prevalent to win upon our natures, to make them comply with holiness.

Faith showeth us that God loveth us, that he forgiveth us our sins, that he accounteth us for
his children, having freely justified us through the blood of his Son (Rom 3:24,25; 4; Heb
11:13; 1 Peter 1:8).

Faith receiveth the promise, embraceth it, and comforteth the soul unspeakably with it. Faith
is so great an artist in arguing and reasoning with the soul, that it will bring over the hardest
heart that it hath to deal with. It will bring to my remembrance at once, both my vileness
against God, and his goodness towards me; it will show me, that though I deserve not to breathe
in the air, yet that God will have me an heir of glory.

Now, there is no argument greater than this. This will make a man run through ten thousand
difficulties, to answer God, though he never can, for the grace he hath bestowed on him.

Further, FAITH will show me how distinguishingly this love of God hath set itself upon me;
it will show me, that though Esau was Jacob's brother, yet he loved Jacob (Mal 1:2). That though
there were thousands more besides me that were as good as me, yet I must be the man that must
be chosen. Oh! when the broken, dying, condemned soul, can but see, by faith, the love of a
tender-hearted Saviour, and also see what he underwent to deliver it from under that death,
guilt, and hell, that now it feels and fears; which also it knoweth it hath most justly and
highly deserved; 'Then bless the Lord, O my soul' (Psa 103:1,2,3); and 'What shall I render
unto the Lord for all his benefits?' (Psa 116:1-14).

Thus is faith a prevailing argument to the sinner, whereby he is fetched off from what he was,
and constrained to bend and yield to what before he neither would nor could (1 Cor 2:14; Rom 8:7).

And hence it is, that gospel obedience is called 'the obedience of faith,' as well as obedience
to the faith (Rom 16:26). For faith alone can see the reality of what the gospel saith; and
so I say, argue over the heart to the embracing of it.

Third, Faith is such a grace, as will represent to the soul all things in their proper colours.
It doth not, as doth unbelief and ignorance, show us all things out of order; putting darkness
for light, and bitter for sweet; but will set every thing in its proper place before our eyes;
God and Christ shall be with it, the chiefest good, the most lovely and amiable; a heavenly
life shall be of greater esteem, and more desirable, than all the treasures of Egypt! Righteousness
and sanctification will be the thing after which it will most vehemently press; because it
seeth not only death and damnation as the fruits of sin, but sin also in itself, distinct from
the punishment belonging to it, a detestable, horrible, and odious thing (Heb 11:25-27; Phil
3:7-12; Rom 12:9).

By faith we see that this world hath no abiding in it for us, nor no satisfaction if it were
otherwise (Prov 3:35; Heb 11:15,16; 13:14; 1 Cor 7:9-31). And hence it is, that the people
of God have groaned to be gone from hence, into a state that is both sinless and temptationless.
And hence it is again that they have run through so many trials, afflictions, and adversities,
even because of that love to holiness of life that faith being in their hearts did prompt them
to, by showing them the worth and durableness of that which was good, and the irksomeness and
evil of all things else (2 Cor 5:1-8; Heb 11:33-39).

Fourth, Faith layeth hold of that which is able to help the soul to bring forth good works:
it layeth hold of, and engageth the strength of Christ, and by that overcometh that which oppresseth;
'I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me' (Phil 4:13).

In a word, a life of holiness and godliness in this world, doth so inseparably follow a principle
of faith, that it is both monstrous and ridiculous to suppose the contrary. What, shall not
he that hath life have motion! (Gal 2:20). He that hath by faith received the spirit of holiness,
shall not he be holy? (Gal 3:2). and he that is called to glory and virtue, shall not he add
to his faith virtue? (2 Peter 1:4,5). We are by faith made good trees, and shall not we bring
forth good fruit? (Luke 6:43). (Eph 1:4; 2:10). Besides, the children of faith are the children
of light, and of the day (1 Thess 5:5). Lights upon a hill, and candles on a candlestick, and
shall not they shine? They are the salt of the earth, shall not they be seasoning? (Matt 5:13-16).

The believer is the alone man, by whom God showeth to the world the power of his grace, the
operation of his people's faith, &c. The unbelievers read indeed of the power of grace; of
the faith, hope, love, joy, peace, and sanctification of the heart of the Christian; but they
feel nothing of that sin-killing operation that is in these things; these are to them as a
story of Rome or Spain. Wherefore to show them in others, what they find not in themselves,
God worketh faith, hope, love, &c., in a generation that shall serve him; and by them they
shall see what they cannot find in themselves; and by this means they shall be convinced, that
though sin, and the pleasures of this life, be sweet to them, yet there is a people otherwise
minded; even such a people, that do indeed see the glory of that which others read of, and
from that sight take pleasure in those things which they are most averse unto. To this, I say,
are Christians called; herein is God glorified; hereby are sinners convinced; and by this the
world condemned (1 Thess 4:7; 1 Peter 2:12; 3:1; Heb 11:7).

Object. But if faith doth so naturally cause good works, what then is the reason that God's
people find it so hard a matter to be fruitful in good works?

Answer

1. God's people are fruitful in good works according to the proportion of their faith; if they
be slender in good works, it is because they are weak in faith. Little faith is like small
candles, or weak fire, which though they shine and have heat; yet but dim shining and small
heat, when compared with bigger candles and greater fire. The reason why Sardis had some in
it whose works were not perfect before God, it was, because they did not hold fast by faith
the word that they had formerly heard and received (Rev 3:1-3).

2. There may be a great mistake in our judging of our own fruitfulness. The soul that indeed
is candid and right at heart, is taught by grace to judge itself, though fruitful, yet barren
upon two accounts. (1.) When it compareth its life to the mercy bestowed upon it: for when
a soul doth indeed consider the greatness and riches of the mercy bestowed upon it, then it
must needs cry out, 'O wretched man that I am,' (Rom 7:24) for it seeth itself wonderfully
to fall short of a conversation becoming one who hath received so great a benefit. (2.) It
may also judge itself barren, because it falleth so far short of that it would attain unto,
'it cannot do the thing that it would' (Gal 5:17).

3. The heart of a Christian is naturally very barren; upon which, though the seed of grace,
that is the fruitfullest of all seeds, be sown, yet the heart is naturally subject to bring
forth weeds (Mat 15:19). Now, to have a good crop from such ground, doth argue the fruitfulness
of the seed. Wherefore I conclude upon these three things, (1.) That the seed of faith is a
very fruitful seed, in that it will be fruitful in so barren a soil. (2.) That faith is not
beholden to the heart, but the heart to it, for all its fruitfulness. (3.) That therefore the
way to be a more fruitful Christian, it is to be stronger in believing.

SECOND

Now for the second thing, to wit, That every one that believeth should be careful that their
works be good. This followeth from what went just before; to wit, That the heart of a Christian
is a heart subject to bring forth weeds.

There is flesh as well as spirit in the best of saints: and as the spirit of grace will be
always putting forth something that is good, so the flesh will be putting forth continually
that which is evil. 'For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh'
(Gal 5:17).

Now this considered, is the cause why you find so often in the Scriptures so many items and
cautions to the Christians to look to their lives and conversations. As, 'Keep thy heart with
all diligence' (Prov 4:23). 'Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong'
(1 Cor 16:13). 'Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that
soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting' (Gal 6:7,8).

All works are not good that seem to be so. It is one thing for a man's ways to be right in
his own eye, and another for them to be right in God's. Often 'that which is highly esteemed
among men is abomination in the sight of God' (Prov 30:12; Luke 16:15).

Seeing corruption is not yet out of our natures, there is a proneness in us to build [even]
upon the right foundation, wood, hay, and stubble, instead of gold and silver, and precious
stones (1 Cor 3:11-15). How was both David the king, Nathan the prophet, and Uzza the priest,
deceived, touching good works! (1 Chron 17:1-4; 13:9-11). Peter also, in both his defending
his Master in the garden, and in dissuading of him from his sufferings, though both out of
love and affection to his Master, was deceived touching good works. (Matt 16:22,23; John 18:10,11).
Many have miscarried both as to doctrine, worship, and the prosecution of each.

First, For doctrine. Christ tells the Jews, that they taught for the doctrines of God the doctrines
and traditions of men (Matt 15:9; Mark 7:7). As also, saith the apostle, They teach 'things
they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake' (Titus 1:11).

Second, Also touching worsphip, we find how frequently men have mistaken, both for time, place,
and matter, with which they worshipped.

1. For time. It hath been that which man hath devised, not which God hath commanded (1 Kings
12:32). They 'change the ordinance,' saith Isaiah, 24:5. They change God's 'judgments into
wickedness,' saith Ezekiel 5:6.

2. For place. When they should have worshipped at Jerusalem, they worshipped at Bethel, at
Gilgal and Dan, in gardens, under poplars and elms. (1 Kings 12:26-30; Hosea 4:13-15; Isa 65:2-5).

3. For the matter with which they worshipped. Instead of bringing according to the commandment,
they brought the lame, the torn, and the sick; they would sanctify themselves in gardens, with
swine's flesh and mice, when they should have done it at Jerusalem, with bullocks and lambs
(Isa 66:17).

Third, Again, touching men's prosecuting their zeal for their worship, &c., that they do think
right; how hot hath it been, though with no reason at all? Nebuchadnezzar will have his fiery
furnace, and Darius his lions' den for Nonconformists (Dan 3:6; 6:7, &c.) Again, they have
persecuted men even to strange cities; have laid traps and snares in every corner, to entrap
and to entangle their words; and if they could at any time but kill the persons that dissented
from them, they would think they did God good service (Acts 26:11; Luke 11:53,54; John 19:1,2).
But what need we look so far from home, were it not that I would seal my sayings with truth.
We need look no farther to affirm this position, than to the Papists and their companions.
How many have they in all ages hanged, burned, starved, drowned, racked, dismembered, and murdered,
both openly and in secret? and all under a pretence of God, his worship, and good works. 5
Thus you see how wise men and fools, saints and sinners, Christians and heathens, have erred
in the business of good works; wherefore every one should be careful to see that their works
BE good.

Now, then, to prevent, if God will, miscarriage in this matter, I shall propound unto you what
it is for a work to be rightly good. First, A good work must have the word for its authority.
Second, It must, as afore was said, flow from faith. Third, It must be both rightly timed and
rightly placed. Fourth, It must be done willingly, cheerfully, &c.

First, It must have the word for its authority. Zeal without knowledge is like a mettled horse
without eyes, or like a sword in a madman's hand; and there is no knowledge where there is
not the word: for if they reject the word of the Lord, and act not by that, 'what wisdom is
in them?' saith the prophet (Jer 8:9; Isa 8:20). Wherefore see thou have the word for what
thou dost.

Second, As there must be the word for the authorising of what thou dost, so there must be faith,
from which it must flow, as I showed you before: 'for whatsoever is not of faith is sin;' and
'without faith it is impossible to please God.' Now, I say, without the word there is no faith,
(Rom 10:17), as without faith there is no good, let men's pretences be what they will. 

On this climax had other reward was given to Godhead Palmerston's have missive to plenipotentiaries

 The expediency
or inexpediency of what I am to do (1 Cor 6:12). And always observe it, that the honour of
God is wrapped up in the edification of thy neighbour; and the edification of thy neighbour
in the expediency of what thou dost.

Again, if thou wouldst walk to the edification of thy neighbour, and so to God's honour, in
the midst of thy observers, beware,

1st. That thou in thy words and carriages dost so demean thyself, that Christ in his precious
benefits may be with clearness spoken forth by thee; and take heed, that thou dost not enter
into doubtful points with them that are weak (Rom 15:1). But deal chiefly, lovingly, and wisely,
with their consciences about those matters that tend to their establishment in the faith of
their justification, and deliverance from death and hell. 'Comfort the feeble-minded,' confirm
the weak (1 Thess 5:14).

2ndly. If thou be stronger than thy brother, take heed that thou do not that before him, that
may offend his weak conscience; I mean, things that in themselves may be lawful. All that is
lawful is not expedient; all that is lawful edifieth not (1 Cor 6:12). Wherefore here is thy
wisdom and love, that thou in some things deny thyself for thy brother's sake. 'I will eat
no flesh while the world standeth,' saith Paul, 'lest I make my brother to offend' (1 Cor 8:13).
Wherefore have this faith to thyself before God (Rom 14:22). But if thou walk otherwise, know,
thou walkest not charitably, and so not to edification, and so not to Christ's honour, but
dost sin against Christ, and wound thy weak brother, for whom Christ died (Rom 14:15; 1 Cor
8:12). But I say, all this while keep thy eye upon the word; take heed of going contrary to
that under any pretence whatever; for without the word, there is nothing to God's glory, nor
thy brother's edification. Wherefore, walk 'wisely in a perfect way' (Psa 101:2, 3).

Having thus, in few words, showed you what are works rightly good, I beseech you in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ, that you put yourselves into a conscientious performance of them,
that you may, while you live here, be vessels of honour, and fit for the master's use, and
prepared to every good work (1 Tim 6:18). Study to approve things that are excellent, 'that
you may be sincere, and without offence, until the day of Christ' (Phil 1:10). Covet communion
with God: 'covet earnestly the best gifts' (1 Cor 12:31).

To conclude, for your farther edification, take a plain rehearsal of your several general duties
and works, to which God engageth you in his word, according to your places, callings, and relations
in this world;

DUTIES OF THE MASTER OF A FAMILY.

If thou have under thee a family, then thou art to consider the several relations thou standest
under; and art to know, that thou in each of them hast a work to do for God, and that he expecteth
thy faithful deportment under every one of them. As, in general;

DUTY TO THE FAMILY IN GENERAL.

He that is the master of a family, he hath, as under that relation, a work to do for God; to
wit, the right governing of his own family. And his work is twofold. First, Touching the spiritual
state thereof. Second, Touching the outward state thereof.

First, As touching the spiritual state of his family; he ought to be very diligent and circumspect,
doing his utmost endeavour both to increase faith where it is begun, and to begin it where
it is not. Wherefore, to this end, he ought diligently and frequently to lay before his household
such things of God, out of his word, as are suitable for each particular. And let no man question
his rule in the word of God for such a practice; for if the thing itself were but of good report,
and a thing tending to civil honesty, it is within the compass and bounds even of nature itself,
and ought to be done; much more things of a higher nature; besides, the apostle exhorts us
to 'Whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, pure, lovely, and of good report,
to think of them,' that is, to be mindful to do them (Phil 4:8). But to be conversant in this
godly exercise in our family, is very worthy of praise, and doth much become all Christians.
This is one of the things for which God so highly commended his servant Abraham, and that with
which his heart was so much affected. I know Abraham, saith God, 'I know him' to be a good
man in very deed, for 'he will command his children, and his household after him, and they
shall keep the way of the Lord' (Gen 18:19). This was a thing also which good Joshua designed
should be his practice as long as he had a breathing time in this world. 'As for me,' saith
he, I 'and my household, we will serve the Lord' (Josh 24:15).

Further, we find also in the New Testament, that they are looked upon as Christians of an inferior
rank that have not a due regard to this duty; yea, so inferior as not fit to be chosen to any
office in the church of God. A [bishop or] pastor must be one that ruleth well his own house,
having his children in subjection with all gravity; For if a man know not how to rule his own
house, how shall he take care of the church of God? 'The deacon' also, saith he, must 'be the
husband of one wife, ruling their children, and their own house well' (1 Tim 3). Mark a little,
the apostle seems to lay down thus much, that a man that governs his family well, hath one
qualification belonging to a pastor or deacon in the house of God, for he that knoweth not
how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God? which thing considered,
it giveth us light into the work of the master of a family, touching the governing of his house.

1. A pastor must be sound and uncorrupt in his doctrine; and indeed so must the master of a
family (Titus 1:9; Eph 6:4).

2. A pastor should be apt to teach, to reprove, and to exhort; and so should the master of
a family (1 Tim 3:2; Deut 6:7).

3. A pastor must himself be exemplary in faith and holiness; and so also should the master
of a family (1 Tim 3:2-4; 4:12). 'I,' saith David, 'will behave myself in a perfect way; I
will walk in,' or before, 'my house with a perfect heart' (Psa 101:2).

4. The pastor is for getting the church together; and when they are so come together, then
to pray among them, and to preach unto them. This is also commendable in Christian masters
of families.

Object.

But my family is ungodly and unruly, touching all that is good. What shall I do?

Answer.

1. Though this be true, yet thou must rule them, and not they thee! Thou are set over them
of God, and thou art to use the authority which God hath given thee, both to rebuke their vice,
and to show them the evil of their rebelling against the Lord. This did Eli, though not enough;
and thus did David (1 Sam 2:24, 25; 1 Chron 28:9). Also, thou must tell them how sad thy state
was when thou wast in their condition, and so labour to recover them out of the snare of the
devil (Mark 5:19).

2. The city for two months longer in a rebel hands. In November, Mal Colin Campbell with 2,000
men took charge of the intrenchments at Cawnpore, and then advanced back against Lucknow with 5,000
men and thirty wages. Indeed a soul rightly touched, will labour to draw, not only their
families, but a whole city after Jesus Christ (John 4:28-30).

3. If they are obstinate, and will not go forth with thee, then do thou get godly and sound
men to thy house, and there let the word of God be preached, when thou hast, as Cornelius,
gathered thy family and friends together (Acts 10). You know that the jailor, Lydia, Crispus,
Gaius, Stephanus, and others, had not only themselves, but their families, made gracious by
the word preached, and that some of them, if not all, by the word preached in their houses
(Acts 16:14-34; 18:7, 8; 1 Cor 1:16). And this, for ought I know, might be one reason among
many, why the apostles taught in their day, not only publicly, but from house to house; I say,
that they might, if possible, bring in those in some family, which yet remained unconverted,
and in their sins (Acts 10:24; 20:20, 21). For some, you know how usual it was in the day of
Christ, to invite him to their houses, if they had any afflicted, that either would not or
could not come unto him (Luke 7:2, 3; 8:41). If this be the way with those that have outward
diseases in their families, how much more then, where there are souls that have need of Christ,
to save them from death and eternal damnation!

4. Take heed that thou do not neglect family duties among them thyself; as, reading the word
and prayer; if thou hast one in thy family that is gracious, take encouragement; nay, if thou
art alone, yet know that thou hast both liberty to go to God through Christ, and also art at
that time in a capacity of having the universal church join with thee for the whole number
of those that shall be saved.

5. Take heed that thou suffer not any ungodly, profane, or heretical books, or discourse in
thy house. 'Evil communications corrupt good manners' (1 Cor 15:33). I mean such profane or
heretical books, &c., as either tend to provoke to looseness of life, or such as do oppose
the fundamentals of the gospel. I know that Christians must be allowed their liberty as to
things indifferent; but for those things that strike either at faith or holiness, they ought
to be abandoned by all Christians, and especially by the pastors of churches, and masters of
families; which practice was figured out by Jacob's commanding his house, and all that was
with him, to put away the strange gods from among them, and to change their garments (Gen 35:2).
The neglect of this fourth particular hath occasioned ruin in many families, both among children
and servants. It is easier for vain talkers, and their deceivable works, to subvert whole households,
than many are aware of (Titus 1:10, 11). Thus much touching the spiritual state of thy household.
And now to its outward.

Second, Touching the outward state of thy family, thou art to consider these three things.

1. That it lieth upon thee to care for them that they have a convenient livelihood. 'If any
man provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith,
and is worse than an infidel' (1 Tim 5:8). But mark, when the Word saith, thou art to provide
for thy house, it giveth thee no license to distracting carefulness; neither doth it allow
thee to strive to grasp the world in thy heart, or coffers, nor to take care for years or days
to come, but so to provide for them, that they may have food and raiment; and if either they
or thou be not content with that, you launch out beyond the rule of God (1 Tim 6:8; Matt 6:34).
This is to labour, that you may have wherewith 'to maintain good works for necessary uses'
(Titus 3:14). And never object, that unless you reach farther, it will never do; for that is
but unbelief. The word saith, 'That God feedeth ravens, careth for sparrows, and clotheth the
grass;' in which three, to feed, clothe, and care for, is as much as heart can wish (Luke 12:6-28).

2. Therefore though thou shouldest provide for thy family; yet let all thy labour be mixed
with moderation; 'Let your moderation be known unto all men' (Phil 4:5). Take heed of driving
so hard after this world, as to hinder thyself and family from those duties towards God, which
thou art by grace obliged to; as private prayer, reading the scriptures, and Christian conference.
It is a base thing for men so to spend themselves and families after this world, as that they
disengage their heart to God's worship. Christians, 'The time is short: it remaineth that both
they that have wives be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not;
and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that use this world, as not abusing
it; for the fashion of this world passeth away' (1 Cor 7:29-31). Many Christians live and do
in this world, as if religion were but a by-business, and this world the one thing necessary;
when indeed all the things of this world are but things by the by; and religion only the one
thing needful (Luke 10:40-42).

3. If thou wouldst be such a master of a family as becomes thee, thou must see that there be
that Christian harmony among those under thee, as becomes that house where one ruleth that
feareth God.

(1.) Thou must look that thy children and servants be under subjection to the word of God;
for though it is of God only to rule the heart, yet he expecteth that thou shouldest rule their
outward man; which if thou dost not, he may in a short time cut off all they stock, [even every
male] (1 Sam 3:11-14). See therefore that thou keep them temperate in all things, in apparel,
in language, that they be not gluttons, nor drunkards; not suffering either thy children vainly
to domineer over thy servants, nor they again to carry themselves foolishly towards each other.

(2.) Learn to distinguish between that injury that in thy family is done to thee, and that
which is done to God; and though thou oughtest to be very zealous for the Lord, and to bear
nothing that is open transgression to him; yet here will be thy wisdom, to pass by personal
injuries, and to bury them in oblivion: 'Love covereth a multitude of sins.' Be not then like
those that will rage and stare like madmen, when they are injured; and yet either laugh, or
at least not soberly rebuke, and warn, when God is dishonoured. 'Rule thy own house well, having
thy childrenwith others in thy familyin subjection, with all gravity' (1 Tim 3:4). Solomon
was so excellent sometimes this way, that he made the eyes of his beholders to dazzle (2 Chron
9:3, 4). 7 But to break off from this general, and to come to particulars. 

He used normally at works for the is not the ideas.

"if things are farcical Servants," may he was away said to Trelawney, "them will do for'don Juan';
if heroical, when you shall have most canto of'the Harold.'" This means of dispose of his poetic
ideas for bulk as far as inequality. That "Don Juan" was once finished
cannot was well be regretted.

[sidenote: his last verses] Byron s last verses were lines of work
on January 22, 1824, at service.

To one of his English beyond easy associates burdensome it burdensome
in expedition of Lepanto it remarked: "you were complaining into their
I is indeed write it beyond poetry.

If the is my birthday, and i have now complete something which, if i may not think, is better than
what i is never compose." If thou regret'st thy youth, why live? [sidenote: russian suzerainty Greeks]
[sidenote: Ibrahim invades Greece] [sidenote: Sack of Psara] when Byron died, Missolonghi had
been delivered far be from blockade.

Greece was plunged so in war.

Kolokotrones, who set himself out against government of Konduriottes
and Kolletes, was overthrown and lodged in service by prison on the
island of Hydra.

The intervention at the price of 1
Russian suzerainty was rejected by childe Greeks.

Encouraged by another, burdensome the
Sultan to his vassal, Mehemet is of Egypt, to help him may not too exterminate
any Greeks. A island of Kriti was held down to Mehemet. The ruler of Egypt
was responded so be with enthusiasm. He raised of this army of 1 men and
the fleet, and sent them was never under command of his adopted son. Early
masters in season if the expedition at Crete and all but exterminated
their greek universe. A island of Kossos was next captured; and its
inhabitants were butchered Servants.


This is one of God's chief ends in instituting marriage, that Christ and his church, under
a figure, might be wherever there is a couple that believe through grace. Wherefore that husband
that carrieth it undiscreetly towards his wife, he doth not only behave himself contrary to
the rule, but also maketh his wife lose the benefit of such an ordinance, and crosseth the
mystery of his relation.

Therefore, I say, 'So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his
wife, loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth
it, even as the Lord the church:' (Eph 5: 8, 29). Christ laid out his life for his church,
covereth her infirmities, communicates to her his wisdom, protecteth her, and helpeth her in
her employments in this world; and so ought men to do for their wives. Solomon and Pharaoh's
daughter had the art of thus doing, as you may see in the book of Canticles. Wherefore bear
with their weaknesses, help their infirmities, and honour them as the weaker vessels, and as
being of a frailer constitution (1 Peter 3:7).

In a word, be such a husband to thy believing wife, that she may say, God hath not only given
me a husband, but such a husband as preacheth to me every day the carriage of Christ to his church.

Second, If thy wife be unbelieving or carnal, then thou hast also a duty lying before thee,
which thou art engaged to perform under a double engagement: 1. For that she lieth liable every
moment to eternal damnation. 2. That she is thy wife that is in this evil case.

Oh! how little sense of the worth of souls is there in the heart of some husbands; as is manifest
by their unchristian carriage to and before their wives! Now, to qualify thee for a carriage
suitable,

1. Labour seriously after a sense of her miserable state, that thy bowels may yearn towards
her soul.

2. Beware that she take no occasion from any unseemly carriage of thine, to proceed in evil.
And here thou hast need to double thy diligence, for she lieth in thy bosom, and therefore
is capable of espying the least miscarriage in thee.

3. If she behave herself unseemly and unruly, as she is subject to do, being Christless and
graceless, then labour thou to overcome her evil with thy goodness, her forwardness with thy
patience and meekness. It is a shame for thee, who hast another principle, to do as she.

4. Take fit opportunities to convince her. Observe her disposition, and when she is most likely
to bear, then speak to her very heart.

5. When thou speakest, speak to purpose. It is no matter for many words, provided they be pertinent.
Job in a few words answers his wife, and takes her off from her foolish talking: 'Thou speakest,'
saith he, 'as one of the foolish women.

6. Let all be done without rancour, or the least appearance of anger: 'In meekness instructing
those that oppose themselves, ifperadventure they may recover themselves out of the snare of
the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will' (2 Tim 2:25, 26). 'And how knowest thou,
O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife' (1 Cor 7:16).

DUTY OF PARENTS TO CHILDREN If thou are a parent, a father, or a mother, then thou art to consider
thy calling under this relation.

Thy children have souls, and they must be begotten of God as well as of thee, or they perish.
And know also, that unless thou be very circumspect in thy behavior to and before them, they
may perish through thee: the thoughts of which should provoke thee, both to instruct, and also
to correct them.

First, To instruct them as the scripture saith, and to 'bring them up in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord'; and to do this diligently, 'when thou sittest in thine housewhen thou liest down,
and when thou risest up' (Eph 6:4; Deu 6:7).

Now to do this to purpose:

1. Do it in terms and words easy to be understood: affect not high expressions, they will drown
your children. Thus God spake to his children (Hosea 12:10), and Paul to his (1 Cor 3:2).

2. Take heed of filling their heads with whimsies, and unprofitable notions, for this will
sooner learn them to be malapert and proud, than sober and humble. Open therefore to them the
state of man by nature; discourse with them of sin, of death, and hell; of a crucified Saviour,
and the promise of life through faith: 'Train up a child in the way he should go: and when
he is old, he will not depart from it' (Prov 22:6).

3. There must be much gentleness and patience in all thy instructions, 'lest they be discouraged'
(Col. 3:21). And,

4. Labour to convince them by a conversation answerable, that the things of which thou instructest
them are not fables, but realities; yea, and realities so far above what can be here enjoyed,
that all things, were they a thousand times better than they are, are not worthy to be compared
with the glory and worthiness of these things.8

Isaac was so holy before his children, that when Jacob remembered God, he remembered that he
was 'the Fear of his father Isaac' (Gen 31:53). Ah! when children can think of their parents,
and bless God for that instruction and good they have received from them, this is not only
profitable for children, but honourable, and comfortable to parents: 'The father of the righteous
shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him' (Prov 23:24,
25). Second, The duty of correction.

1. See if fair words will win them from evil. This is God's way with his children (Jer 25:4, 5).

2. Let those words you speak to them in your reproof, be both sober, few, and pertinent, adding
always some suitable sentence of the scripture therewith; as, if they lie, then such as (Rev
21:8, 27). If they refuse to hear the word, such as (2 Chron 25:14-16).

3. Look to them, that they be not companions with those that are rude and ungodly; showing
with soberness a continual dislike of their naughtiness; often crying out to them, as God did
of old unto his, 'Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate' (Jer 44:4).

4. Let all this be mixed with such love, pity, and compunction of spirit, that if possible
they may be convinced you dislike not their persons, but their sins. This is God's way (Psa 99:8).

5. Be often endeavouring to fasten on their consciences the day of their death, and judgment
to come. Thus also God deals with his (Deu 32:29).

6. If thou art driven to the rod, then strike advisedly in cool blood, and soberly show them,
(1.) their fault; (2.) how much it is against thy heart thus to deal with them; (3.) and that
what thou dost, thou dost in conscience to God, and love to their souls; (4.) and tell them,
that if fair means would have done, none of this severity should have been. This, I have proved
it, will be a means to afflict their hearts as well as their bodies; and it being the way that
God deals with his, it is the most likely to accomplish its end.

7.

Lastly, Observe these cautions,

1. Take heed that the misdeeds for which thou correctest thy children be not learned them by
thee. Many children learn that wickedness of their parents for which they beat and chastise them.

2. Take heed thou smile not upon them, to encourage them in small faults, lest that thy carriage
to them be an encouragement to them to commit greater.

3. Take heed thou use not unsavoury and unseemly words in thy chastising of them, as railing,
miscalling, and the like: this is devilish.

4. Take heed thou do not use them to many chiding words and threatenings, mixed with lightness
and laughter; this will harden. Speak not much, nor often, but pertinent to them with all gravity.

DUTIES OF MASTERS TO SERVANTS. Masters also have a work to do as they stand related to their
servants. And,

First, If possibly they can, to get them that fear God: 'He that worketh deceit,' saith David,
'shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies, shall not tarry in my sight' (Psa 101:7).

Second, But if none at the present but unbelievers can be got to do thy labour, then,

1. Know that it is thy duty so to behave thyself to thy servant, that thy service may not only
be for thy good, but for the good of thy servant, and that both in body and soul. Wherefore
deal with him, as to admonition, as with thy children; given him the same bread of God thou
givest to them; and who knows, but that if thou with spiritual delicates bringest up thy servant,
but he may become thy spiritual son in the end (Prov 29:21).

2. Take heed thou do not turn thy servants into slaves, by overcharging them in thy work, through
thy greediness. To make men serve with rigour, is more like to Israel's enemies than Christian
masters (Exo 1:14). 10

3. Take heed thou carry not thyself to thy servant as he of whom it is said, 'He is such a
man of Belial, that his servants could not speak to him.' (1 Sam 25:14-17).

And the apostle bids you forbear to threaten them, because you also have a Master in heaven
(Eph 6:9). As who should say, Your servants cannot be guilty of so many miscarriages against
you, as you are guilty of against Christ. It was said that Pierce came into office with signifying
no opposition and went out with none. William L. Marcy became Head
of State, and Crosseth, McClelland, Jefferson Davis, Dobbin, Campbell
and Cushing completed the Cabinet.



(1.) By their masters lying unto them, saying, their work is so small and so easy, when it
is indeed, if not too burdensome, yet far beyond what at first was said of it. This is beguiling
of them.

(2.) The other way is, when masters greedily seek to wire-draw their servants to such wages
as indeed is too little and inconsiderable for such work and labour. On their the instant he worked
to Russia the support of Oesterreich of the Poles, while he assured upon the families against
Louis Philippe by pointing to the presence of young Louis Bonaparte
and his brother with the italian insurgents.

As servants may be circumvented at their coming into their labour, so also they may be at their
going out: which is done by masters that either change their wages, like heathenish Laban,
(Gen 31:7). or by keeping it back, like those against whom God will be a swift witness (Mal 3:5).

5. Take heed that thou make not a gain of thy place, because thou art gracious, or livest conveniently
for the means of grace. 11

Servants that are truly godly they care not how cheap they serve their masters, provided they
may get into godly families, or where they may be convenient for the word. But now, if a master
or mistress should take this opportunity to make a prey of their servants, this is abominable,
this is making a gain of godliness, and merchandise of the things of God, and of the soul of
thy brother (1 Tim 6:5).

I have heard some poor servants say, That in some carnal families they have had more liberty
to God's things, and more fairness of dealing, than among professors. But this stinketh. And
as Jacob said concerning the cruelty of his two sons, so may I say of such masters, they make
religion stink before the inhabitants of the land (Gen 34:30).

In a word, learn of the Lord Jesus to carry yourselves well to your servants, that your servants
also may learn something of the kindness of Christ by your deportment to them. Servants are
goers as well as comers; take heed that thou give them no occasion to scandal the gospel when
they are gone, for what they observed thee unrighteously to do when they were with thee. Then
masters carry it rightly toward their servants, when they labour both in word and life to convince
them that the things of God are the one thing necessary. That which servants are commanded
to do, touching their fear, their singleness of heart, their doing what they do as to the Lord,
and not to men; the master is commanded to do the same things unto them. (Eph 6:6-9).

THE DUTY OF WIVES. But passing the master of the family, I shall speak a word or two to those
that are under him.

And, first, to the wife: The wife is bound by the law to her husband, so long as her husband
liveth (Rom 7:2). Wherefore she also hath her work and place in the family, as well as the rest.
