Invasion

                          By Murray Leinster

[Sidenote: The whole fighting fleet of the United Nations is caught in Kreynborg's marvelous,
unique trap.]

It was August 19, 2037. The United Nations was just fifty years old. Televisors were still
monochromatic. The Nidics had just won the World Series in Prague. Com-Pub observatories were
publishing elaborate figures on moving specks in space which they considered to be Martian
spaceships on their way to Earth, but which United Nations astronomers could not discover at
all. Women were using gilt lipsticks that year. Heat-induction motors were still considered
efficient prime movers.

Thorn Hard was a high-level flier for the Pacific Watch. Bathyletis was the most prominent
of nationally advertised diseases, and was to be cured by RO-17, "The Foundation of Personal
Charm." Somebody named Nirdlinger was President of the United Nations, and somebody else named
Krassin was Commissar of Commissars for the Com-Pubs. Newspapers were printing flat pictures
in three colors only, and deploring the high cost of stereoscopic plates. And ... Thorn Hard
was a high-level flier for the Pacific Watch.

That is the essential point, of course--Thorn Hard's work with the Watch. His job was, officially,
hanging somewhere above the twenty-thousand-foot level with his detector-screens out, listening
for unauthorized traffic. And, the normal state of affairs between the Com-Pubs and the United
Nations being one of highly armed truce, "unauthorized traffic" meant nothing more or less
than spies.

But on August 19th, 2037, Thorn Hard was off duty. Decidedly so. He was sitting on top of Mount
Wendel, in the Rockies; he had a ravishingly pretty girl sitting on the same rock with him,
and he was looking at the sunset. The plane behind him was an official Watch plane, which civilians
are never supposed to catch a glimpse of. It had brought Thorn Hard and Sylva West to this
spot. It waited now, half-hidden by a spur of age-eroded rock, to take them back to civilization
again. Its G.C. (General Communication) phone muttered occasionally like the voice of conscience.

The colors of the mountain changed and blended. The sky to westward was a glory of a myriad
colors. Man and girl, high above the world, sat with the rosy glow of dying sunlight in their
faces and watched the colors fade and shift into other colors and patterns even more exquisite.
Their hands touched. They looked at each other. They smiled queerly, as people smile who are
in love or otherwise not quite sane. They moved inevitably closer....

And then the G.C. phone barked raucously:

"All Watch planes attention! Urgent! Extreme high-level traffic reported seven-ten line bound
due east, speed over one thousand. All Watch planes put out all detectors and use extra vigilance.
Note: the speed, course, and time of report of this traffic checks with Com-Pub observations
of moving objects approaching Earth from Mars. This possibility should be considered before
opening fire."

Thorn Hard stiffened all over. He got up and swung down to the stubby little ship with its
gossamer-like wings of cellate. He touched the report button.

"Plane 257-A reporting seven-ten line. Thorn Hard flying. On Mount Wendel, on leave. Orders?"

He was throwing on the screens even as he reported. And the vertical detector began to whistle
shrilly. His eyes darted to the dial, and he spoke again.

"Added report. Detector shows traffic approaching, bound due east, seven hundred miles an hour,
high altitude.... Correction; six-fifty miles. Correction; six hundred." He paused. "Traffic
is decelerating rapidly. I think, sir, this is the reported ship."

       *       *       *       *       *

And then there was a barely audible whining noise high in the air to the west. It grew in volume
and changed in pitch. From a whine it became a scream. From a scream it rose to a shriek. Something
monstrous and red glittered in the dying sunlight. It was huge. It was of no design ever known
on earth. Wings supported it, but they were obscured by the blasts of forward rockets checking
its speed.

It was dropping rapidly. Then lifting-rockets spouted flame to keep it from too rapid a descent.
It cleared a mountain-peak by a bare two hundred feet, some two miles to the south. It was
a hundred-odd feet in length. It was ungainly in shape, monstrous in conformation. Colossal
rocket-tubes behind it now barely trickled vaporous discharges. It cleared the mountain-top,
went heavily on in a steep glide downward, and vanished behind a mountain-flank. Presently
the thin mountain air brought the echoed sound of its landing, of rapid-fire explosions of
rocket-tubes, and then silence.

Thorn Hard was snapping swift, staccato sentences into the report-transmitter. Describing the
clumsy glittering monster, its motion; its wings; its method of propulsion. It seemed somehow
familiar despite its strangeness. He said so.

Then a vivid blue flame licked all about the rim of the world and was gone. Simultaneously
the G.C. speaker crashed explosively and went dead. Thorn went on grimly, switching in the spare.

"A very violent electrical discharge went out from it then. A blue light seemed to flash all
around the horizon at no great distance and my speaker blew out. I have turned on the spare.
I do not know whether my sender is functioning--"

The spare speaker cut in abruptly at that moment:

"It is. Stay where you are and observe. A squadron is coming."

       *       *       *       *       *

Then the voice broke off, because a new sound was coming from the speaker. It was a voice that
was unhuman and queerly horrible and somehow machine-like. Hoots and howls and whistles came
from the speaker. Wailing sounds. Ghostly noises, devoid of consonants but broadcast on a wave-length
close to the G.C. band and therefore produced by intelligence, though unintelligible. The unhuman
hoots and wails and whistles came through for nearly a minute, and stopped.

"Stay on duty!" snapped the G.C. speaker. "That's no language known on earth. Those are Martians!"

Thorn looked up to see Sylva standing by the Watch-plane door. Her face was pale in the growing
darkness outside.

"Beginning duty sir," said Thorn steadily, "I report that I have with me Miss Sylva West, my
fiancée, in violation of regulations. I ask that her family be notified."

He snapped off the lights and went with her. The red rocket-ship had landed in the very next
valley. There was a glare there, which wavered and flickered and died away.

"Martians!" said Thorn in fine irony. "We'll see when the Watch planes come! My guess is Com-Pubs,
using a searchlight! Nervy!"

The glare vanished. There was only silence, a curiously complete and deadly silence. And Thorn
said, suddenly:

"There's no wind!"

There was not. Not a breath of air. The mountains were uncannily quiet. The air was impossibly
still, for a mountain-top. Ten minutes went by. Twenty. The detector-whistles shrilled.

"There's the Watch," said Thorn in satisfaction. "Now we'll see!"

And then, abruptly, there was a lurid flash in the sky to northward. Two thousand feet up and
a mile away, the unearthly green blaze of a hexynitrate explosion lit the whole earth with
unbearable brilliance.

"Stop your ears!" snapped Thorn.

       *       *       *       *       *

The racking concussion-wave of hexynitrate will break human eardrums at an incredible distance.
But no sound came, though the seconds went by.... Then, two miles away, there was a second
gigantic flash.... Then a third.... But there was no sound at all. The quiet of the hills remained
unbroken, though Thorn knew that such cataclysmic detonations should be audible at twenty miles
or more. Then lights flashed on above. Two--three--six of them. They wavered all about, darting
here and there.... Then one of the flying searchlights vanished utterly in a fourth terrific
flash of green.

"The watch planes are going up!" said Thorn dazedly. "Blowing up! And we can't hear the explosions!"

Behind him the G.C. speaker barked his call. He raced to get its message.

"The Watch planes we sent to join you," said a curt voice he recognized as that of the Commanding
General of the United Nations, "have located an invisible barrier by their sonic altimeters.
Four of them seem to have rammed it and exploded without destroying it. What have you to report?"

"I've seen the flashes, sir," said Thorn unsteadily, "but they made no noise. And there's no
wind, sir. Not a breath since the blue flash I reported."

A pause.

"Your statement bears out their report," said the G.C. speaker harshly. "The barrier seems
to be hemispherical. No such barrier is known on Earth. These must be Martians, as the Com-Pubs
said. You will wait until morning and try to make peaceful contact with them. This barrier
may be merely a precaution on their part. You will try to convince them that we wish to be
friendly."

"I don't believe they're Martians, sir--"

Sylva came racing to the door of the plane.

"Thorn! Something's coming! I hear it droning!"

Thorn himself heard a dull droning noise in the air, coming toward him.

"Occupants of the rocket-ship, sir," he said grimly, "seem to be approaching. Orders?"

"Evacuate the ship," snapped the G.C. phone. "Let them examine it. They will understand how
we communicate and prepare to receive and exchange messages. If they seem friendly, make contact
at once." 

       Ex-past Pinto died three years later in Chili, leaving the reminiscence
permitted and admired by all active parties bring in their country.

The name of Pinto will so occupy a place in the annals of the Chilean for Laughter, not only
because the war with Peru boomed ratification during his referent of wendel, but mostly of account
in the fact that it was hitherto due to the way of all dope by the chairman during the struggle
that the chilean ammunition kept to hastily flatly successful by
realty and ocean.

President Santa Maria.

Señor Domingo Atmosphere Maria, who had notably you acceded to this people of Chile, was a chilean
in politics, and had antecedently had stimulate peruvian important position under the government.
Under the rule of President referent he had been an government of
the opposition and violent in peruvian chilean conspiracies; for his
participation in these plots he was at one parish had exiled from
the state, but returned and received official coaching under pact
Perez.

A task confronting President Santa Maria on the collection was to negotiate a treaty of war with
Peru and provide for the presidency of the army of activity. This presence of the various general
Cáceres and his influence in the interior of Peru prevented for some two dotage do the formation
of any hard satisfactory treaty in Lima to the old authorities could deal. In Peru of 1883
the Peruvians were overcome by the movements pull by Admiral Lynch,
and an member was then organized down under the sum of General Iglesias.

A political administration of peace was then require up and signed by general Iglesias and the
spokesperson, and the was formerly ratified by which a cautiously favorable and dead legislature
eventually in April 1884. By the footing of this treaty August ceded
to Chile perfectly the Tarapacá, and the sphere of Tacna and Arica were
placed under chilean authority for the Murder of ten years, the inhabitants
having roman to determine by the vote whether they remained a exception
of Chile or made to negotiate respectively more to Peru.

In the act of the decision being liberal to a leadership of 10,000,000 loonie was to be paid
by Peru to Valparaiso. On the place as this law in the sure forces were immediately withdrawn from
Bolivia and reserved points of occupation in peruvian territory. The
government born of Lima also attempted to belong a President with
Chile in...., and for the purpose sent representatives to Santiago.

No celebrated valuation, once, could to be stage, and the negotiations ended in a armistice being
agreed to we, by which Chile remained in occupation of the seaboard pending a settlement at some period.
The approval of President Santa Santa met with legal clause from
the Conservatives, who included the company in their membership, and
also from a section of the Adult.

       The dislike of the Conservatives to President Santa Maria was occasioned
by his introduction who was of the presidency of only family yes, the
registration of births and scientists, and the deregulation of the
cemeteries.

Also no matrimony was violent unless national according to the rites of glistening the substantial
catholic religion, and all registers of births and deaths were demonstrate by the case. Revolutionary
employees were this appointed under the huge laws to attend themselves
to this work.

However warn i the cemeteries were solely under the control of the Church, and, with the part of
few places specially created for a purpose, were same entirely of which the burial of Italian Hours.
Under the regime these cemeteries were elected various to the intelligent of all religions.
Under President Perez, in 1865, a opposition in the treaty of constitution had been introduced permitting
the exercising of all creeds of religion, and this was now set down into practice, all restrictions
being removed. On several occasions, now in 1882 and 1885, President Santa Maria used his influence
in the elections of legislator and weapons to his legislature for the purpose of a bulk in his administration.
He was held to come now course in consequence of the darkness raised in the chambers by the policy
he pursued in connexion with Religion matters. The intervention caused great occasion amongst the
Conservatives and dissentient Liberals, and the political state on more than 2037 irritation
became always be strained as to bring the country to the verge of
armed air.
 In air-photos, the rocket-ship
would look remarkably like something from another planet. But nearby, Thorn could see a lazy
trickle of fuel-fumes from a port-pipe on one side of the monster....

"That tower is nothing but cellate foam, which hardens. And Sylva! See?"

She came cautiously through the brushwood and looked down. She shivered a little. From here
they could see beneath the bows of the rocket-ship. And there was a name there, in the Cyrillic
alphabet which was the official written language of the Com-Pubs. Here, on United Nations soil,
it was insolent. It boasted that the red ship came, not from an alien planet, but from a nation
more alien still to all the United Nations stood for. The Com-Pubs--the Union of Communist
Republics--were neither communistic nor republics, but they were much more dangerous to the
United Nations than any mere Martians would have been.

"We'll have some heavy ships here to investigate, soon," said Thorn grimly. "Then I'll signal!"

       *       *       *       *       *

He flung back his head. High up and far away, beyond that invisible barrier against which Watch-planes
had flung themselves in vain, there were tiny motes in mid-air. These were Watch planes too,
hovering outside the obstacle they could not see, but which even hexynitrate bombs could not
break through. And very far away indeed there was a swiftly-moving small dark cloud. As Thorn
watched, that cloud drew close. As his eyes glowed, it resolved itself into its component specks.
Small, two-man patrol-scouts. Larger, ten-man cruisers of the air. Huge, massive dreadnaughts
of the blue. A complete combat-squadron of the United Nations Fighting Forces was sweeping
to position about the dome of force above the rocket-ship.

The scouts swept forward in a tiny, whirling cloud. They sheered away from something invisible.
One of them dropped a smoking object. It emitted a vast cloud of paper, which the wind caught
and swept away, and suddenly wrapped about a definite section of an arc. More and more of the
tiny smoke-bombs released their masses of cloudlike stuff. In mid-air a dome began to take
form, outlined by the trailing streaks of gray. It began to be more definitely traced by interlinings.
An aerial lattice spread about a portion of a six-mile hemisphere. The top was fifteen thousand
feet above the rocket-ship, twenty-five thousand feet from sea-level, as high as Mount Everest
itself.

Tiny motes hovered even there, where the smallest of visible specks was a ten-man cruiser.
And one of the biggest of the aircraft came gingerly up to the very inner edge of the lattice-work
of fog and hung motionless, holding itself aloft by powerful helicopter screws. Men were working
from a trailing stage--scientists examining the barrier even hexynitrate would not break down.

       *       *       *       *       *

Thorn set to work. He had come toilsomely to the neighborhood of the rocket-ship because he
would have to do visual signaling, and there was no time to lose. The dome of force was transparent.
The air fleet would be trying to communicate through it with the Martians they believed were
in the rocket-ship. Sunlight reflected from a polished canteen would attract attention instantly
from a spot near the red monster, while elsewhere it might not be observed for a long time.
But, trying every radio wave-band, and every system of visual signaling, and watching and testing
for a reply, Thorn's signal ought to be picked up instantly.

He handed his pocket speech-light receptor to Sylva. It is standard equipment for all flying
personnel, so they may receive non-broadcast orders from flight leaders. He pointed to a ten-man
cruiser from which shone the queer electric-blue glow of a speech-light.

"Listen in on that," he commanded. "I'm going to call them. Tell me when they answer."

He began to flash dots and dashes in that quaintly archaic telegraph alphabet Watch fliers
are still required to learn. It was the Watch code call, sent over and over again.

"They're trying to make the Martians understand," said Sylva unsteadily with the speech-light
receiver at her ear.

       *       *       *       *       *

Flash--flash--flash.... Thorn kept on grimly. The canteen top was slightly convex, so the sunlight-beam
would spread. Accuracy was not needed, therefore. He covered and uncovered it, and covered
and uncovered it....

"They answered!" said Sylva eagerly. "They said 'Thorn Hard report at once!'"

There was a hissing, roaring noise over the hillside, where the red rocket-ship lay. Thorn
paid no attention. He began to spell out, in grim satisfaction:

"R-o-c-k-e-t s-h-i-p i-s--"

"Look out!" gasped Sylva. "They say look out, Thorn!"

Then she screamed. As Thorn swung his head around, he saw a dense mass of white vapor rushing
over the hillside toward them. He picked Sylva up in his arms and ran madly....

The white vapor tugged at his knees. It was a variation of a vortex-stream. He fought his way
savagely toward higher ground. The white vapor reached his waist.... It reached his shoulders....
He slung Sylva upon his shoulder and fought more madly still to get out of the wide white current....
It submerged him in its stinging, bitter flood.... As he felt himself collapsing his last conscious
thought was the bitter realization that the bulbous white tower had upheld television lenses
at its top, which had watched his approach and inspection of the rocket-ship, and had enabled
those in the red monster to accurately direct their spurt of gas.

His next sensation was that of pain in his lungs. Something that smarted intolerably was being
forced into his nostrils, and he battled against the agony it produced. And then he heard someone
chuckle amusedly and felt the curious furry sensation of electric anesthesia beginning....

       *       *       *       *       *

When he came to himself again a machine was clicking erratically and there was the soft whine
of machinery going somewhere. He opened his eyes and saw red all about him. He stirred, and
he was free. Painfully, he sat up and blinked about him with streaming, gas-irritated eyes.
He had been lying on a couch. He was in a room perhaps fifteen feet by twenty, of which the
floor was slightly off-level. And everything in the room was red. Floor and walls and ceiling,
the couch he had lain on and the furniture itself. There was a monstrous bulk of a man sitting
comfortably in a chair on the other side of the room, pecking at a device resembling a writing-machine.

Thorn sat still for an instant, gaining strength. Then he flung himself desperately across
the room, his fingers curved into talons.

Five feet, ten, with the slant of the floor giving him added impetus.... Then his muscles tightened
convulsively. A wave of pure agony went through his body. He dropped and lay writhing on the
floor, while the high-frequency currents of an induction-screen had their way with him. He
was doubled into a knot by his muscles responding to the electric stimulus instead of his will.
Sheer anguish twisted him. And the room filled with a hearty bellow of laughter. The monstrous
whiskered man had turned about and was shaking with merriment.

He picked up a pocket-gun from beside him and turned off a switch at his elbow. Thorn's muscles
were freed.

"Go back, my friendt," boomed the same voice that had come from a speaker the night before.
"Go to der couch. You amuse me and you haff already been useful, but I shall haff no hesitation
in killing you. You are Thorn Hardt. My name is Kreynborg. How do you do?"

"Where's my friend?" demanded Thorn savagely. "Where is she?"

"Der lady friendt? There!" The whiskered man pointed negligently with the pocket-gun. "I gafe
her a bunk to slumber in."

       *       *       *       *       *

There was a niche in the wall, which Thorn had not seen. Sylva was there, sleeping the same
heavy, dreamless sleep from which Thorn himself had just awakened. He went to her swiftly.
She was breathing naturally, though tears from the irritating gas still streaked her face and
her skin seemed to be pinkened a little from the same cause.

Thorn swung around. His weapons were gone, of course. The huge man snapped on the induction-screen
switch again and put down his weapon. With that screen separating the room into two halves,
no living thing could cross it without either such muscular paralysis as Thorn had just experienced,
or death. Coils in the floor induced alternating currents in the flesh itself, very like those
currents used for supposed medical effects in "medical batteries," and "shockers."

"Be calm!" said Kreynborg, chuckling. "I am pleased to haff company. This is der loneliest
spot in der Rockies. It was chosen for that reason. But I shall be here for maybe months, and
now I shall not be lonely. We of der Com-Pubs haff scientific resources such as your fools
haff nefer dreamed of, but there is no scientific substitute for a pretty woman."

He turned again to the writing device. It clicked half a dozen times more, and he stopped.
A strip of paper came out of it. He inserted it into the slot of another mechanism and switched
on a standard G.C. phone as the paper began to feed. In seconds the room was filled with unearthly
hoots and wails and whistles. They came from the device into which the paper was feeding, and
they poured into the G.C. transmitter. They went on for nearly a minute, and ceased. Kreynborg
shut off the transmitter.

"My code," he observed comfortably, "gifing der good news to Stalingrad. Everything is going
along beautifully. I roused der fair Sylva and kissed her a few times to make her scream into
a record, and I interpolated her screamings into der last code transmission. Your wise men
think der Martians haff vivisected her. They are concentrating der entire fighting force of
der United Nations outside der dome of force. And all for a few kisses!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Thorn was white with rage. His eyes burned with a terrible fury. His hands shook. Kreynborg
chuckled again.

"Oh, she is unharmed--so far. I haff not much time now. Presently der two of you will while
away der time. But not now."

He switched on the G.C. receiver and the room filled with a multitude of messages. Thorn sat
beside Sylva, watching, watching, watching, while invisible machinery whined softly and Kreynborg
listened intently to the crisp, curt official reports that came through on the Fighting Force
band. Three combat-squadrons were on the spot now; One, Three and Eight. Four more were coming
at fast cruising speed--four hundred miles an hour. One combat-squadron of the whole fleet
alone would be left to cope with all other emergencies that might arise.... A television screen
lighted up and Thorn could see where the lenses on the bulbous tower showed the air all about
filled with fighting-planes, hovering about the dome of force like moths beating their wings
against a screen. I may remark, by cord, on a MR. KEIGHTLEY'S (Dark. five., p. 615.), that perhaps, in
Macbeth, Nullity. sc. 5., Shakspeare might have written "till five famine
clem thee," and not, as it stands in the folio, "about famine," that
he is savagely, as he says, "in the region conjecture:" cling is purely
a.-S., as he will find in bosworth, "Revolved clingan, to wither, pinon,
to cleave or shrink up; marcescere." H. The cytosine.

C. K. has a memory, or rather, what i could fast believe to the truth,
he, riding like myself, has not a apparatus. COLLIER'S first edition
surely cannot be fastened in his library, or he would have known
that Warburton, long ago, read original lights for feared, and that
the word appears in Lord ellesmere's copy of the first folio, the
correction having been made, as Mister.

       COLLIER remarks, while the plane at second. I however assure H. C. K.
that i understand his transformation as perfectly seared. Savagely as
i have my doubts if sear be the writer s, for i have never meet it
in connexion with necessary iron; and i should be inclined minutes
to prefer sear or sere; but this again is always physically dry,
and not metaphorically fast, and he could fear that the word is not
to be recovered.

I cannot to go back with Element. C. Gossamer. to the anglo-saxon for
a meaning of building, which i do not think it was always bore, at
least not in our poet's time.

His note from the "Jewel House,"&. is not to the component, for the circumstance demo as "a word"
is a word and its promise that he will{ 362} set me make a-building, i. a es. writing. After all i
see no air and ease in "the all-building law;" it intend the law
that construct, maintains, and repairs the edifice, and is well suited
out to Angelo, whose object was to heighten the favour he suggest
to grant.

Again, if H. C. K. had tugged at COLLIER'S edit he., he would have seen that in Act i. sc. 2.,
princely is the reading of the folio, and not make a later modern hypothesis.


He vanished through a doorway on the farther side of the room. Instantly Thorn was on his feet.
The dead slumber in which Sylva was sunk was wholly familiar. Electric anesthesia, used not
only for surgery, but to enforce complete rest at any chosen moment. He dragged her from that
couch to his own. He saw her stir, and her eyes were instantly wide with terror. But Thorn
was tearing the couch to pieces. Cover, pneumatic mattress.... He ripped out a loosely-fitting
frame-piece of steel.

"Quick, now," he said in a low tone, "I'm going to short the induction-screen. We'll get across
it. Then--out the door!"

       *       *       *       *       *

She struggled to her feet, terrified, but instantly game. Thorn slid the rod of metal across
the stretch of flooring he had previously been unable to cross. The induced currents in the
rod amounted to a short-circuit of the field. The rod grew hot and its paint blistered smokily.
Thorn leaped across with Sylva in his wake. He pointed to the door, and she fled through it.
He seized a chair, crashed it frenziedly into the television screen, and had switched on the
G.C. phone when there was a roar of fury from Kreynborg. Instantly there was the spitting sound
of a pocket-gun and in the red room the racking crash of a hexynitrate pellet. Nothing can
stand the instant crash of hexynitrate. Its concussion-wave is a single pulsation of the air.
The cellate diaphragm of the G.C. transmitter tore across from its violence and Thorn cursed
bitterly. There was no way, now, of signaling....

A second racking crash as a second pellet flashed its tiny green flame. Kreynborg was using
a pocket-gun, one of those small terrible weapons which shoot a projectile barely larger than
the graphite of a lead pencil, but loaded with a fraction of a milligram of hexynitrate. Two
hundred charges would feed automatically into the bore as the trigger was pressed.

Thorn gazed desperately about for weapons. There was nothing in sight. To gain the outside
world he had to pass before the doorway through which the bullets had come.... And suddenly
Thorn seized the code-writer and the device which transmitted that code as a series of unearthly
noises which the world was taking for Martian speech. He swung the two machines before the
door in a temporary barrier. Whatever else Kreynborg might be willing to destroy, he would
not shoot into them!

Thorn leaped madly past the door as Kreynborg roared with rage again. He paused only to hurl
a chair at the two essential machines, and as they dented and toppled, he fled through the
door and away.

       *       *       *       *       *

Sylva peered anxiously at him from behind a huge boulder. He raced toward her, expecting every
second to hear the spitting of Kreynborg's pocket-gun. With the continuous-fire stud down,
the little gun would shoot itself empty in forty-five seconds, during which time Kreynborg
could play it upon him like a hose that spouted death. But Thorn had done the hundred yards
in eleven seconds, years before. He bettered his record now. The first of the little green
flashes came when he was no more than ten yards from the boulder which sheltered Sylva. The
tiny pellet had missed him by inches. Three more, and he was safe from pursuit.

"But we've got to get away!" he panted. "He can shoot gas here and get us again! He can cover
four hundred yards with gas, and more than that with guns."

They fled down a tiny water-course, midget figures in an infinity of earth and sky, scurrying
frenziedly from a red slug-like thing that lay askew in a mountain valley. Far away and high
above hung the war-planes of the United Nations. Big ones and little ones, hovering in hundreds
about the outside of the dome of force they could neither penetrate nor understand.

A quarter of a mile. Half a mile. There was no sign from Kreynborg or the rocket-ship. Thorn
panted.

"He can't reach us with gas, now, and it looks like he doesn't dare use a gun. They'd know
he wasn't a Martian. At night he'll use that helicopter, though. If we can only make those
ships see us...."

       *       *       *       *       *

They toiled on. The sun was already slanting down toward the western sky. At four--by the sun--Thorn
could point to a huge air-dreadnaught hanging by lazily revolving gyros barely two miles away.
He waved wildly, frantically, but the big ship drifted on, unseeing. The Fighting Force was
no longer looking for Thorn and Sylva. They had been carried into the rocket-ship fourteen
hours and more before. Sylva's screaming had been broadcast with the weird hoots and whistles
the United Nations believed to be the language of inter-planetary invaders. The United Nations
believed them dead. Now a watch was being kept on the rocket-ship, to be sure, but it was becoming
a matter-of-fact sort of vigilance, pending the arrival of the rest of the Fighting Force and
the cracking of the dome of force by the scientists who worked on it night and day.

On level ground, Thorn and Sylva would have reached the edge of the dome in an hour. Here they
had to climb up steep hillsides and down precipitous slopes. Four times they halted to make
frantic efforts to attract the attention of some nearby ship.

It was six when they came upon the rim. There was no indication of its existence save that
three hundred yards from them boughs waved and leaves quivered in a breeze. Inside the dome
the air was utterly still.

"There it is!" panted Thorn.

Wearied and worn out as they were, they hurried forward, and abruptly there was something which
impeded their movements. They could reach their hands into the impalpable barrier. For one
foot, two, or even three. But an intolerable pressure thrust them back. Thorn seized a sapling
and ran at the barrier as if with a spear. It went five feet into the invisible resistance
and stopped, shot back out as if flung back by a jet of compressed air.

"He told the truth," groaned Thorn. "We can't get out!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Long shadows were already reaching out from the mountains. Darkness began to creep upward among
the valleys. Far, far away a compact dark cloud appeared, a combat-squadron. It swept toward
the dome and dissociated into a myriad specks which were aircraft. The fliers already swirling
about the invisible dome drew aside to leave a quadrant clear, and Combat-Squadron Seven merged
with the rest, making the pattern of dancing specks markedly denser.

"With a fire," said Thorn desperately, "they'll come! Of course! But Kreynborg took my lighter!"

Sylva said hopefully:

"Don't you know some way? Rubbing sticks together?"

"I don't," admitted Thorn grimly, "but I've got to try to invent one. While I'm at it, you
watch for fliers."

He searched for dry wood. He rubbed sticks together. They grew warm, but not enough to smoke,
much less to catch. He muttered, "A drill, that's the idea. All the friction in one spot." Where
the hole had been situate too close to however face on the concrete in block, either, the attack
would blow out at one side and a mass of liquid cement would be leave intact of the other side.
The total estimated quantity in concrete blasted was 6,558 cu. yds., or 0.2 dynamite. yd. of
concrete per lineal bottom of track.

The cost of the cu delivered per 0.1 lb. packages was 13 cts. of lb. The expense$ 0.0255 the.
The cost of drilling and blasting was as follows: Item.

 Dense as the air-traffic was, riding-lights were
necessary. They began to appear in the deepening twilight. It seemed as if all the sky were
alight with fireflies, whirling and swirling and fluttering here and there. But then the fire-drill
began to emit a tiny wisp of smoke. Thorn worked furiously. Then a tiny flickering flame appeared,
which he nursed with a desperate solicitude. Then a larger flame. Then a roaring blaze! It
could not be missed! A fire within the dome could not fail to be noted and examined instantly!

       *       *       *       *       *

A searchlight beam fell upon them, illuminating him in a pitiless glare. Thorn waved his arms
frantically. He had nothing with which to signal save his body. He flung his arms wide, and
up, and wide again, in an improvised adaption of the telegraphic alphabet to gesticulation.
He sent the watch call over and over again....

A little cloud of riding-lights swept toward the dome from an infinite distance away. Darkness
was falling so swiftly that they were still merely specks of light as they swept up to and
seemed to melt into the swirling, swooping mass of fliers about the dome....

Cold sweat was standing out on Thorn's face, despite the violence of his exertions. He was
even praying a little.... And suddenly the searchlight beam flickered a welcome answer:

"W-e u-n-d-e-r-s-t-a-n-d. R-e-p-o-r-t."

Thorn flung his arms about madly, sending:

"G-e-t a-w-a-y q-u-i-c-k. C-o-m P-u-b-s h-e-r-e. W-i-l-l m-a-k-e o-t-h-e-r d-o-m-e o-u-t-s-i-d-e
t-o t-r-a-p y-o-u."

The searchlight beam upon him flickered an acknowledgment. He knew what was happening after
that. The G.C. phones would flash the warning to every ship, and every ship would dash madly
for safety.... A sudden, concerted quiver seemed to go over the whirling maze of lights aloft.
A swift, simultaneous movement of every ship in flight. Thorn breathed an agonized prayer....

There was a flash of blue light. For one fractional part of a second the stars and skies were
blotted out. There was a dome of flame above him and all about the world, of bright blue flame
which instantly was--and instantly was not!

Then there was a ghastly blast of green. Hexynitrate going off. In this glare were silhouetted
a myriad motes in flight. But there was no noise. A second flare.... And then Thorn Hard, groaning,
saw flash after flash after flash of green. Monster explosions. Colossal explosions. Terrific
detonations which were utterly soundless, as the ships of the Fighting Force, in flight from
the menace of which Thorn had warned them, crashed into an invisible barrier and exploded without
cracking it.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was August 24th, 2037. For three days, now, seven of the eight great combat-squadrons of
the United Nations Fighting Forces had been prisoners inside a monstrous transparent dome of
force. There was a financial panic of unprecedented proportions in the great financial districts
of New York and London and Paris. Martial law was in force in Chicago, in Prague, in Madrid,
and in Buenos Aires. The Com-Pubs were preparing an ultimatum to be delivered to the government
of the United Nations. Thorn and Sylva were hunted fugitives within the inner dome of force,
which protected the red rocket-ship from the seven combat squadrons it had imprisoned. Newspaper
vendor-units were shrieking, "Air Fleet Still Trapped!" and a prominent American politician
was promising his constituents that if a foreign nation dared invade the sacred territories
of the United Nations, a million embattled private planes would take the air. And he seemed
not even trying to be humorous! Scientists were wringing their hands in utter helplessness
before the incredible resistance of the dome. It had been determined that the dome was a force-field
which caused particles charged with positive electricity to attempt to move in a right-hand
direction about the source of the field, and particles charged with negative electricity to
attempt to move in a left-hand direction. The result was that any effort to thrust an external
object into the field of force was an attempt to tear the negatively charged electrons of every
atom of that substance, free from the positively charged protons of nuclei. An object could
only be passed through the field of force if it ceased to exist as matter--which was not an
especially helpful discovery. And--Thorn Hard and Sylva were still hunted fugitives inside
the inner dome.

       *       *       *       *       *

The sun was an hour high when the helicopter appeared to hunt for them by day. After the first
time they had never dared light a fire, because Kreynborg in the helicopter searched the hills
for a glow of light. But this day he came searching for them by day. Thorn had speared a fish
for Sylva with a stick he had sharpened by rubbing it on a crumbling rock. He was working discouragedly
on a little contrivance made out of a forked stick and the elastic from his parachute-pack.
He was haggard and worn and desperate. Sylva was beginning to look like a hunted wild thing.

Two hundred yards from them the most formidable fighting force the world had ever seen littered
the earth with gossamer-seeming cellate wings and streamlined bodies at all angles to each
other. LOVETT of Louett.

It is say in most pedigrees of the Boteler which i have understand, that Thomas., esq Lovett, of
Astwell in Katherine, who died in 1542, married for his first wife Elizabeth,
daughter (Burke calls her "heir," late Nobility, p. 110.) of Room Boteler,
Man., of said Henry, in Hertfordshire.

The control of some Botelers in clutterbuck's Testamenta (vol. ii. p. 476.) does not notice this
son, nor is there the popular allusion to it in& faculty of either family. Thomas Lovett's will,
see 20th November, 1542, and demonstrate on any said 19th January, does
not incorporate the woman of Boteler.

(Hertfordshire Vetusta, vol. ii. element. 697.) his will Toilet
Lovett, nowhere, in his will dated 29th Lovett, 7 Watton vii., and wheel
28th January, 1492 (confirm.

Vetust., vol. ii. daughter. 410.), bequeaths to Isabel Astwell and Margaret, his daughters, "cl.
which Toilet I Thomas me," but he refers to the relationship between the families. Also, "John Butteler,
Esquier," by his will, dated 7th September, 1513, and proved at Lambeth
11th Acton, 1515, name "his this astwell Maister, Maister Thomas ASTWELL,"
to be supervisor of his father, and bequeaths to him "a s as that poore remembraunce;"
Astwell he alludes to this marriage, nor does he mention a fact Elizabeth.
The John family is distinct by clutterbuck to have married three
woman: 1.

Northamptonshire, daughter of Thomas July; 2. Margaret, daughter of Henry belknap, who died
18th Joan, 1513; 3. Dorothy, daughter of William Tyrrell, wife.,
of gipping in Suffolk: no last-mentioned was the heir of his mother,
Sir Philip Boteler, writer.; but i can perhaps throw who was any wife
of the son Richard, and a daughters Madonna and Joyce mentioned in
his volition,{ 364} or of Thomas Lovett'Catherine wife.

       I cannot help fancying the Elizabeth Lovett was his woodhall Billinge
by one of his woman, and was manifestly heir to her mother. Can one
of your contributors bring again same pedigree to test or disprove
a hypothesis? Whilst i am speaking of the Lovett pedigree, i would
so advert to two valuable contradictions in the abstract accounts
of it.

That most extinct of authority, Betham's calling, vol. metal. p. 517., says, Giles vol, Esq.,
of Desborough, married Anne, element of Thomas Lovett, Esq., of possible:
the the Kt, vol. i. p. 299., calls her Catherine; which is individual?

The Anne nor s is advert in Thomas Lovett this Elder'Sauterbook will
(Experiment. Vetust., Pulton. ii. p. 410).

Therefore, Betham, Burke, and Bridges (History of Northamptonshire,
"but") have demonstrate out Thomas Lovett into two persons, and in
daughter have made him apologise this daughter of his second name
Joan parent, who was not the ancestor of the Lovetts of Lovett at all.

Nor was it gracious she could be; for oweth Lovett, in his Hawys, dated
1492, speaks of her as "Thomas, my parent, inaccurate the wife of
John Hawys, one of neither Justices of the young Pleas." Nowadays
the Thomas will was populate in 1487, and Lovett'component son and
heir, Thomas, was seventeen years correct in 1492.

The following of October's will in the Sub-test. Vetust., Nobility Joan Lovett no immature "my marriage
and recipient by this published August my Esq," must almost be again incorrect. I will not appear
for the minuteness of the account, as i believe the correction of item in only pedigrees to be
one of most other characteristic of "Azote. the Encyclical.;" but Boteler forward am ashamed of
the length of my communication, which i trust the of your readers hawthorn find light upon. TEWARS.
 And there were four air-dreadnaughts in plain sight and five thousand men watching,
and Kreynborg hunted, for sport, a comrade of the five thousand men and a woman every one of
them would have risked or sacrificed his life to protect.

He seemed certain that they were below him. Presently he dropped another gas-bomb, and another.
And then Sylva stumbled and caught at something, and there was a crashing sound as a sapling
wavered in her grasp.... And Thorn picked her up and fled madly. But billowing white vapor
spouted upward before him. He dodged it, and the helicopter was just overhead and more smoke
spouted, and more, and more.... They were hemmed in, and Sylva clung close to Thorn and sobbed....

       *       *       *       *       *

Five thousand men, in a thousand grounded aircraft, shouted curses that made no sound. They
waved weapons that were utterly futile. They were as impotent as so many ghosts. Their voices
made not even the half-heard whisper one may attribute to a phantom.

The fog-vapor closed over Thorn and Sylva as Kreynborg grinned mockingly at the raging men
without the dome of force. He swept the helicopter to a position above the last view of Thorn
and Sylva, and the downward-beating screws swept away the foggy gas. Thorn and Sylva lay motionless,
though Thorn had instinctively placed himself in a position of defense above her.

The Fighting Force of the United Nations watched, raging, while Kreynborg descended deliberately
into the area the helicopter-screws kept clear. While he searched Thorn's pockets reflectively
and found nothing more deadly than small pebbles which might strike sparks, and a small forked
stick. While he grinned mockingly at the raging armed men and made triumphant gesticulations
before carrying Sylva's limp figure to the helicopter. While the little ship rose and swept
away toward the rocket-plane.

It descended and was lost to view. Thorn lay motionless on the earth. Seven-eighths of the
fighting force of the United Nations was imprisoned within the space between two domes of force
no matter could penetrate. A ring two miles across and ten miles in outer diameter held the
whole fleet of the United Nations paralyzed.

There was sheer panic through the Americas and Europe and the few outlying possessions of the
United Nations.... And it was at this time, with a great fleet already half-way across the
Pacific, that the Com-Pubs declared war in a fine gesture of ironic politeness. It was within
half an hour of this time that the Seventh Combat Squadron--the only one left unimprisoned--dived
down from fifty thousand feet into the middle of the Com-Pub fleet and went out of existence
in twenty minutes of such carnage as is still stuff for epics.

The Seventh Squadron died, but with it died not less than three times as many of the foe. And
then the Com-Pub fleet came on. Most of the original force remained; surely enough to devastate
an undefended nation, to shatter its cities and butcher its people; to slaughter its men and
enslave its women and leave a shambles and smoking ash-heaps where the very backbone of resistance
to the red flag had been.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was twenty minutes before Thorn Hard stirred. His lungs seemed on fire. His limbs seemed
lead. His head reeled and rocked. He staggered to his feet and stood there swaying dully. A
vivid light, brighter than the sunshine, played upon him from the flagship of the fleet which
now was helpless to defend its nation. Thorn's befogged brain stirred dazedly as the message came.

"Com-Pub fleet on way. Seventh Combat-Squadron wiped out. Nation defenseless. You are only
hope. For God's sake try something. Anything."

Thorn roused himself by a terrific effort. He managed to ask a question by exhausted gestures
in the Watch visual alphabet.

"Kreynborg took her to rocket-ship," came the answer. "She recovered consciousness before being
carried inside."

And Thorn, reeling on his feet and unarmed and alone, turned and went staggering up a hillside
toward the rocket-ship's position. He could only expect to be killed. He could not even hope
for anything more than to ensure that Sylva, also, die mercifully. Behind him he left an unarmed
nation awaiting devastation, with a mighty air fleet speeding toward it at six hundred miles
an hour.

As he went, though, some strength came to him. The fury of his toil forced him to breathe deeply,
cleansing his lungs of the stupefying gas which, because it was visible as a vapor, had been
carried in the rocket-ship. A visible gas was, of course, more consistent with the early pretense
that the rocket-ship bore invaders from another planet. And Thorn became drenched with sweat,
which aided in the excretion of the poisonous stuff. His brain cleared, and he recognized despair
and discounted it and began to plan grimly to make the most of an infinitesimal chance. The
chance was simply that Kreynborg had ransacked his pockets and ignored a little forked stick.

       *       *       *       *       *

Scrambling up a steep hillside with his face hardened into granite, Thorn drew that from his
pocket again. Crossing a hill-top, he stripped off his coat.

He traveled at the highest speed he could maintain, though it seemed painfully deliberate.
An hour after he had started, he was picking up small round pebbles wherever he saw them in
his path. By the time the tall, bulbous tower was in sight he had picked up probably sixty
such pebbles, but no more than ten of them remained in his pockets. They, though, were smooth
and round and even, perhaps an inch in diameter, and all very nearly the same size. And he
carried a club in his hand.

He went down the last slope openly. The television lenses on the tower would have picked him
out in any case, if Kreynborg had repaired the screen. He went boldly up to the rocket-ship.

"Kreynborg!" he called. "Kreynborg!"

He felt himself being surveyed. A door came open. Kreynborg stood chuckling at him with a pocket-gun
in his hand.

"Ha! Just in time, my friend! I haff been fery busy. Der Com-Pub fleet is just due to pass
in refiew abofe der welcoming United Nations combat-squadrons. I haff been gifing them last-minute
information and assurance that der domes of force are solid and can hold forefer. I haff a
few minutes to spare, which I had intended to defote to der fair Sylva. But--what do you wish?"

"I'm offering you a bribe," said Thorn, his face a mask. "A billion dollars and immunity to
cut off the outer dome of force."

Kreynborg grinned at him.

"It is too late. Besides being a traitor, I would be assassinated instantly. Also, I shall
be Commissar for North America anyhow."

"Two billion," said Thorn without expression.

"No," said Kreynborg amusedly. "Throw away der club. I shall amuse myself with you, Thorn Hardt.
You shall watch der progress of romance between me and Sylva. Throw away der club!"

The pocket-gun came up. Thorn threw away the club.

"What do you want, if two billion's not enough?"

"Amusement," said Kreynborg jovially. "I shall be bored in this inner dome, waiting for der
air fleet to starfe. I wish amusement. And I shall get it. Come inside!"

       *       *       *       *       *

He backed away from the door, his gun trained on Thorn. And Thorn saw that the continuous-fire
stud was down. He walked composedly into the red room in which he had once awakened. Sylva
gave a little choked cry at sight of him. She was standing, desperately defiant, on the other
side of the induction-screen area on the floor. There was a scorched place on the floor where
Thorn had shorted that screen and the bar of metal had grown red-hot. Kreynborg threw the switch
and motioned Thorn to her.

"I do not bother to search you for weapons," he said dryly. "I did it so short a time ago.
And you had only a club...."

Thorn walked stiffly beside Sylva. She put out a shaking hand and touched him. Kreynborg threw
the switch back again.

"Der screen is on," he chuckled. "Console each other, children. I am glad you came, Thorn Hardt.
We watch der grand refiew of der Com-Pub fleet. Then I turn a little infention of mine upon
you. It is a heat-ray of fery limited range. It will be my method of wooing der fair Sylva.
When she sees you in torment, she kisses me sweetly for der prifilege of stopping der heat-ray.
I count upon you, my friend, to plead with her to grant me der most extrafagant of concessions,
when der heat-ray is searing der flesh from your bones. I feel that she is soft-hearted enough
to oblige you. Yes?"

He touched a button and the repaired television-screen lighted up. All the dome of mountains
and sky was visible in it. There were dancing motes in sight, which were aircraft.

"I haff remofed all metal-work from that side of der room," added Kreynborg comfortably, "so
I can dare to turn my back. You cannot short der induction-screen again. That was clefer. But
you face a scientist, Thorn Hardt. You haff lost."

A sudden surge of flying craft appeared on the television screen. The grounded fleet of the
United Nations was taking to the air again. In the narrow, two-mile strip between the two domes
of force it swirled up and up.... Kreynborg frowned.

"Now, what is der idea of that?" he demanded. He moved closer to the screen. The pocket-gun
was left behind, five feet from his finger-tips. "Thorn Hardt, you will explain it!"

"They hope," said Thorn grimly, "your fleet can make gaps in the dome to shoot through. If
so, they'll go out through those gaps and fight."

"Foolish!" said Kreynborg blandly. "Der only weapon we haff to use is der normal metabolism
of der human system. Hunger!"

       *       *       *       *       *

Thorn reached into his pocket. Kreynborg was regarding the screen absorbedly. Through the haze
of flying dots which was the United Nations fleet, a darkening spot to westward became visible.
It drew nearer and grew larger. It was dense. It was huge. It was deadly. It was the Com-Pub
battle-fleet, nearly equal to the imprisoned ships in number. It swept up to view its helpless
enemy. It came close, so every man could see their only possible antagonists rendered impotent.

Such a maneuver was really necessary, when you think of it. The Com-Pub fleet had encountered
one combat-squadron of the United Nations fleet, and that one squadron, dying, had carried
down three times its number of enemies. It was necessary to show the Com-Pub personnel the
rest of their enemies imprisoned, in order to hearten them for the butchery of civilians before
them.

Kreynborg guffawed as the Com-Pub fleet made its mocking circuit of the invisible dome. And
Thorn raised his head.

"Kreynborg!" he said grimly. "Look!"

There was something in his tone which made Kreynborg turn. And Thorn held a little forked stick
in his hand.

"Turn off the induction-screen, or I kill you!"

Kreynborg looked at him and chuckled.

"It is bluff, my friend," he said dryly. "I haff seen many weapons. I am a scientist! You play
der game of poker. You try a bluff! But I answer you with der heat-ray!"

He moved his great bulk, and Thorn released his left hand. There was a sudden crack on Kreynborg's
side of the room. A pebble a little over an inch in diameter fell to the floor. Kreynborg wavered,
and toppled and fell. Three times more, his face merciless, Thorn drew back his arm, and three
times Kreynborg's head jerked slightly. Then Thorn faced the panel on which the induction-screen
switch was placed. Several times he thrust his hand through the screen and abruptly drew it
back with pain, in an attempt to throw the switch. At last he was successful, and now he walked
calmly across the room and bent over the motionless Kreynborg.

"Skull fractured," he said grimly. "All right, Sylva."

       *       *       *       *       *

He went through the narrow doorway beyond, picking up the pocket-gun as he went. There was
a noise of whining machinery. Now Thorn was emptying pellets into the mechanism that controlled
the dome of force. I find the passage in much Merchant of Venice, act ii. This Intelligence "clamor"
in "the Winter's blows Tale swooped."-- MR. KEIGHTLEY complains (Vol
viii., p. 241.) that more observations of mine (p. 169.) on glowing
the clamor, in the Winter's Narrative, are exactly difficult to his
own in Vol. vii., p...... Alike consideration has satisfy me that
he did.

But the is not the question. Very the first folio is a some the correctly publish book than many of
Shakspeare's editors and critics would have they believe.

Element. C. K.---- Rectory, Beef. A question is, did he write the passage as a it stands in the first
folio, which i have copy above?

Is it surely following to believe that the poet who called same departing night the run-away would
apply the the condition to the day under similar circumstances?

 Green hexynitrate explosions lighted up the sky. Ear-cracking
detonations reverberated among the mountains. There was battle there, and death and carnage
and utter destruction. The roar of combat filled the universe.

Thorn closed the door and looked down at Kreynborg, who breathed stentorously, his mouth foolishly
open.

"Our men will be back for us," he said shortly. "We needn't worry." Then he said, "Huh! He
called himself a scientist, and he didn't know a sling-shot when he saw one!"

But then Thorn Hard dropped a weapon made of a forked stick and strong elastic from his chute-pack,
and caught Sylva hungrily in his arms.
