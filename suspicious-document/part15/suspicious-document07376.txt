Jim sucked and sucked at the jug, and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around
and yelled; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again.  His foot
swelled up pretty big, and so did his leg; but by and by the drunk begun to come, and so I
judged he was all right; but I'd druther been bit with a snake than pap's whisky.

Jim was laid up for four days and nights.  Then the swelling was all gone and he was around
again.  I made up my mind I wouldn't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands,
now that I see what had come of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And
he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the
end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand
times than take up a snake-skin in his hand.  Well, I was getting to feel that way myself,
though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of
the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.  Old Hank Bunker done it once, and bragged
about it; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower, and spread
himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer, as you may say; and they slid him edgeways
between two barn doors for a coffin, and buried him so, so they say, but I didn't see it. 
Pap told me.  But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way, like a fool.

Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks again; and about the first
thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a
catfish that was as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two hundred
pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us into Illinois.  We just set
there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his
stomach and a round ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet, and
there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to coat it over so and make
a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim
said he hadn't ever seen a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.
They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there; everybody buys
some of him; his meat's as white as snow and makes a good fry.

Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull, and I wanted to get a stirring up some way.
I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on.  Jim liked that
notion; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp.  Then he studied it over and said,
couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?  That was a good notion,
too.  So we shortened up one of the calico gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees
and got into it.  Jim hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the
sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in and see my face was like
looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.
I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty well
in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown
to get at my britches-pocket.  I took notice, and done better.

I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark.
