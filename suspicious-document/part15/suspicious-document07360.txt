1. HOW THE BRIGADIER CAME TO THE CASTLE OF GLOOM[A]

You do very well, my friends, to treat me with some little reverence, for in honouring me you
are honouring both France and yourselves. It is not merely an old, grey-moustached officer
whom you see eating his omelette or draining his glass, but it is a fragment of history. In
me you see one of the last of those wonderful men, the men who were veterans when they were
yet boys, who learned to use a sword earlier than a razor, and who during a hundred battles
had never once let the enemy see the colour of their knapsacks. For twenty years we were teaching
Europe how to fight, and even when they had learned their lesson it was only the thermometer,
and never the bayonet, which could break the Grand Army down. Berlin, Naples, Vienna, Madrid,
Lisbon, Moscow--we stabled our horses in them all. Yes, my friends, I say again that you do
well to send your children to me with flowers, for these ears have heard the trumpet calls
of France, and these eyes have seen her standards in lands where they may never be seen again.

Even now, when I doze in my arm-chair, I can see those great warriors stream before me--the
green-jacketed chasseurs, the giant cuirassiers, Poniatowsky's lancers, the white-mantled dragoons,
the nodding bearskins of the horse grenadiers. And then there comes the thick, low rattle of
the drums, and through wreaths of dust and smoke I see the line of high bonnets, the row of
brown faces, the swing and toss of the long, red plumes amid the sloping lines of steel. And
there rides Ney with his red head, and Lefebvre with his bulldog jaw, and Lannes with his Gascon
swagger; and then amidst the gleam of brass and the flaunting feathers I catch a glimpse of
him, the man with the pale smile, the rounded shoulders, and the far-off eyes. There is an
end of my sleep, my friends, for up I spring from my chair, with a cracked voice calling and
a silly hand outstretched, so that Madame Titaux has one more laugh at the old fellow who lives
among the shadows.

Although I was a full Chief of Brigade when the wars came to an end, and had every hope of
soon being made a General of Division, it is still rather to my earlier days that I turn when
I wish to talk of the glories and the trials of a soldier's life. For you will understand that
when an officer has so many men and horses under him, he has his mind full of recruits and
remounts, fodder and farriers, and quarters, so that even when he is not in the face of the
enemy, life is a very serious matter for him. But when he is only a lieutenant or a captain
he has nothing heavier than his epaulettes upon his shoulders, so that he can clink his spurs
and swing his dolman, drain his glass and kiss his girl, thinking of nothing save of enjoying
a gallant life. That is the time when he is likely to have adventures, and it is often to that
time that I shall turn in the stories which I may have for you. So it will be tonight when
I tell you of my visit to the Castle of Gloom; of the strange mission of Sub-Lieutenant Duroc,
and of the horrible affair of the man who was once known as Jean Carabin, and afterwards as
the Baron Straubenthal.

You must know, then, that in the February of 1807, immediately after the taking of Danzig,
Major Legendre and I were commissioned to bring four hundred remounts from Prussia into Eastern
Poland.

The hard weather, and especially the great battle at Eylau, had killed so many of the horses
that there was some danger of our beautiful Tenth of Hussars becoming a battalion of light
infantry. We knew, therefore, both the Major and I, that we should be very welcome at the front.
We did not advance very rapidly, however, for the snow was deep, the roads detestable, and
we had but twenty returning invalids to assist us. Besides, it is impossible, when you have
a daily change of forage, and sometimes none at all, to move horses faster than a walk. I am
aware that in the story-books the cavalry whirls past at the maddest of gallops; but for my
own part, after twelve campaigns, I should be very satisfied to know that my brigade could
always walk upon the march and trot in the presence of the enemy. This I say of the hussars
and chasseurs, mark you, so that it is far more the case with cuirassiers or dragoons.

For myself I am fond of horses, and to have four hundred of them, of every age and shade and
character, all under my own hands, was a very great pleasure to me. They were from Pomerania
for the most part, though some were from Normandy and some from Alsace, and it amused us to
notice that they differed in character as much as the people of those provinces. We observed
also, what I have often proved since, that the nature of a horse can be told by his colour,
from the coquettish light bay, full of fancies and nerves, to the hardy chestnut, and from
the docile roan to the pig-headed rusty-black. All this has nothing in the world to do with
my story, but how is an officer of cavalry to get on with his tale when he finds four hundred
horses waiting for him at the outset? It is my habit, you see, to talk of that which interests
myself and so I hope that I may interest you.

We crossed the Vistula opposite Marienwerder, and had got as far as Riesenberg, when Major
Legendre came into my room in the post-house with an open paper in his hand.

'You are to leave me,' said he, with despair upon his face.

It was no very great grief to me to do that, for he was, if I may say so, hardly worthy to
have such a subaltern. I saluted, however, in silence.

'It is an order from General Lasalle,' he continued; 'you are to proceed to Rossel instantly,
and to report yourself at the headquarters of the regiment.'

No message could have pleased me better. I was already very well thought of by my superior
officers. It was evident to me, therefore, that this sudden order meant that the regiment was
about to see service once more, and that Lasalle understood how incomplete my squadron would
be without me. It is true that it came at an inconvenient moment, for the keeper of the post-house
had a daughter--one of those ivory-skinned, black-haired Polish girls--with whom I had hoped
to have some further talk. Still, it is not for the pawn to argue when the fingers of the player
move him from the square; so down I went, saddled my big black charger, Rataplan, and set off
instantly upon my lonely journey.

My word, it was a treat for those poor Poles and Jews, who have so little to brighten their
dull lives, to see such a picture as that before their doors! The frosty morning air made Rataplan's
great black limbs and the beautiful curves of his back and sides gleam and shimmer with every
gambade. As for me, the rattle of hoofs upon a road, and the jingle of bridle chains which
comes with every toss of a saucy head, would even now set my blood dancing through my veins.
You may think, then, how I carried myself in my five-and-twentieth year--I, Etienne Gerard,
the picked horseman and surest blade in the ten regiments of hussars. Blue was our colour in
the Tenth--a sky-blue dolman and pelisse with a scarlet front--and it was said of us in the
army that we could set a whole population running, the women towards us, and the men away.
There were bright eyes in the Riesenberg windows that morning which seemed to beg me to tarry;
but what can a soldier do, save to kiss his hand and shake his bridle as he rides upon his way?

It was a bleak season to ride through the poorest and ugliest country in Europe, but there
was a cloudless sky above, and a bright, cold sun, which shimmered on the huge snowfields.
My breath reeked into the frosty air, and Rataplan sent up two feathers of steam from his nostrils,
while the icicles drooped from the side-irons of his bit. I let him trot to warm his limbs,
while for my own part I had too much to think of to give much heed to the cold. To north and
south stretched the great plains, mottled over with dark clumps of fir and lighter patches
of larch. A few cottages peeped out here and there, but it was only three months since the
Grand Army had passed that way, and you know what that meant to a country. The Poles were our
friends, it was true, but out of a hundred thousand men, only the Guard had waggons, and the
rest had to live as best they might. It did not surprise me, therefore, to see no signs of
cattle and no smoke from the silent houses. A weal had been left across the country where the
great host had passed, and it was said that even the rats were starved wherever the Emperor
had led his men.

By midday I had got as far as the village of Saalfeldt, but as I was on the direct road for
Osterode, where the Emperor was wintering, and also for the main camp of the seven divisions
of infantry, the highway was choked with carriages and carts. What with artillery caissons
and waggons and couriers, and the ever-thickening stream of recruits and stragglers, it seemed
to me that it would be a very long time before I should join my comrades. The plains, however,
were five feet deep in snow, so there was nothing for it but to plod upon our way. It was with
joy, therefore, that I found a second road which branched away from the other, trending through
a fir-wood towards the north. There was a small auberge at the cross-roads, and a patrol of
the Third Hussars of Conflans--the very regiment of which I was afterwards colonel--were mounting
their horses at the door. On the steps stood their officer, a slight, pale young man, who looked
more like a young priest from a seminary than a leader of the devil-may-care rascals before him.

'Good-day, sir,' said he, seeing that I pulled up my horse.

'Good-day,' I answered. 'I am Lieutenant Etienne Gerard, of the Tenth.'

I could see by his face that he had heard of me. Everybody had heard of me since my duel with
the six fencing masters. My manner, however, served to put him at his ease with me.

'I am Sub-Lieutenant Duroc, of the Third,' said he.

'Newly joined?' I asked.

'Last week.'

I had thought as much, from his white face and from the way in which he let his men lounge
upon their horses. It was not so long, however, since I had learned myself what it was like
when a schoolboy has to give orders to veteran troopers. It made me blush, I remember, to shout
abrupt commands to men who had seen more battles than I had years, and it would have come more
natural for me to say, 'With your permission, we shall now wheel into line,' or, 'If you think
it best, we shall trot.' I did not think the less of the lad, therefore, when I observed that
his men were somewhat out of hand, but I gave them a glance which stiffened them in their saddles.

'May I ask, monsieur, whether you are going by this northern road?' I asked.

'My orders are to patrol it as far as Arensdorf,' said he.

'Then I will, with your permission, ride so far with you,' said I. 'It is very clear that the
longer way will be the faster.'

So it proved, for this road led away from the army into a country which was given over to Cossacks
and marauders, and it was as bare as the other was crowded. Duroc and I rode in front, with
our six troopers clattering in the rear. He was a good boy, this Duroc, with his head full
of the nonsense that they teach at St Cyr, knowing more about Alexander and Pompey than how
to mix a horse's fodder or care for a horse's feet. Still, he was, as I have said, a good boy,
unspoiled as yet by the camp. It pleased me to hear him prattle away about his sister Marie
and about his mother in Amiens. Presently we found ourselves at the village of Hayenau. Duroc
rode up to the post-house and asked to see the master.

'Can you tell me,' said he, 'whether the man who calls himself the Baron Straubenthal lives
in these parts?'

The postmaster shook his head, and we rode upon our way. I took no notice of this, but when,
at the next village, my comrade repeated the same question, with the same result, I could not
help asking him who this Baron Straubenthal might be.

'He is a man,' said Duroc, with a sudden flush upon his boyish face, 'to whom I have a very
important message to convey.'

Well, this was not satisfactory, but there was something in my companion's manner which told
me that any further questioning would be distasteful to him. I said nothing more, therefore,
but Duroc would still ask every peasant whom we met whether he could give him any news of the
Baron Straubenthal.

For my own part I was endeavouring, as an officer of light cavalry should, to form an idea
of the lay of the country, to note the course of the streams, and to mark the places where
there should be fords. Every step was taking us farther from the camp round the flanks of which
we were travelling. Far to the south a few plumes of grey smoke in the frosty air marked the
position of some of our outposts. To the north, however, there was nothing between ourselves
and the Russian winter quarters. Twice on the extreme horizon I caught a glimpse of the glitter
of steel, and pointed it out to my companion. It was too distant for us to tell whence it came,
but we had little doubt that it was from the lance-heads of marauding Cossacks.

The sun was just setting when we rode over a low hill and saw a small village upon our right,
and on our left a high black castle, which jutted out from amongst the pine-woods. A farmer
with his cart was approaching us--a matted-haired, downcast fellow, in a sheepskin jacket.

'What village is this?' asked Duroc.

'It is Arensdorf,' he answered, in his barbarous German dialect.

'Then here I am to stay the night,' said my young companion. Then, turning to the farmer, he
asked his eternal question, 'Can you tell me where the Baron Straubenthal lives?'

'Why, it is he who owns the Castle of Gloom,' said the farmer, pointing to the dark turrets
over the distant fir forest.

Duroc gave a shout like the sportsman who sees his game rising in front of him. The lad seemed
to have gone off his head--his eyes shining, his face deathly white, and such a grim set about
his mouth as made the farmer shrink away from him. I can see him now, leaning forward on his
brown horse, with his eager gaze fixed upon the great black tower.

'Why do you call it the Castle of Gloom?' I asked.

'Well, it's the name it bears upon the countryside,' said the farmer. 'By all accounts there
have been some black doings up yonder. It's not for nothing that the wickedest man in Poland
has been living there these fourteen years past.'

'A Polish nobleman?' I asked.

'Nay, we breed no such men in Poland,' he answered.

'A Frenchman, then?' cried Duroc.

'They say that he came from France.'

'And with red hair?'

'As red as a fox.'

'Yes, yes, it is my man,' cried my companion, quivering all over in his excitement. 'It is
the hand of Providence which has led me here. Who can say that there is not justice in this
world? Come, Monsieur Gerard, for I must see the men safely quartered before I can attend to
this private matter.'

He spurred on his horse, and ten minutes later we were at the door of the inn of Arensdorf,
where his men were to find their quarters for the night.

Well, all this was no affair of mine, and I could not imagine what the meaning of it might
be. Rossel was still far off, but I determined to ride on for a few hours and take my chance
of some wayside barn in which I could find shelter for Rataplan and myself. I had mounted my
horse, therefore, after tossing off a cup of wine, when young Duroc came running out of the
door and laid his hand upon my knee.

'Monsieur Gerard,' he panted, 'I beg of you not to abandon me like this!'

'My good sir,' said I, 'if you would tell me what is the matter and what you would wish me
to do, I should be better able to tell you if I could be of any assistance to you.'

'You can be of the very greatest,' he cried. 'Indeed, from all that I have heard of you, Monsieur
Gerard, you are the one man whom I should wish to have by my side tonight.'

'You forget that I am riding to join my regiment.'

'You cannot, in any case, reach it tonight. Tomorrow will bring you to Rossel. By staying with
me you will confer the very greatest kindness upon me, and you will aid me in a matter which
concerns my own honour and the honour of my family. I am compelled, however, to confess to
you that some personal danger may possibly be involved.'

It was a crafty thing for him to say. Of course, I sprang from Rataplan's back and ordered
the groom to lead him back into the stables.

'Come into the inn,' said I, 'and let me know exactly what it is that you wish me to do.'

He led the way into a sitting-room, and fastened the door lest we should be interrupted. He
was a well-grown lad, and as he stood in the glare of the lamp, with the light beating upon
his earnest face and upon his uniform of silver grey, which suited him to a marvel, I felt
my heart warm towards him. Without going so far as to say that he carried himself as I had
done at his age, there was at least similarity enough to make me feel in sympathy with him.

'I can explain it all in a few words,' said he. 'If I have not already satisfied your very
natural curiosity, it is because the subject is so painful a one to me that I can hardly bring
myself to allude to it. I cannot, however, ask for your assistance without explaining to you
exactly how the matter lies.

'You must know, then, that my father was the well-known banker, Christophe Duroc, who was murdered
by the people during the September massacres. As you are aware, the mob took possession of
the prisons, chose three so-called judges to pass sentence upon the unhappy aristocrats, and
then tore them to pieces when they were passed out into the street. My father had been a benefactor
of the poor all his life. There were many to plead for him. He had the fever, too, and was
carried in, half-dead, upon a blanket. Two of the judges were in favour of acquitting him;
the third, a young Jacobin, whose huge body and brutal mind had made him a leader among these
wretches, dragged him, with his own hands, from the litter, kicked him again and again with
his heavy boots, and hurled him out of the door, where in an instant he was torn limb from
limb under circumstances which are too horrible for me to describe. This, as you perceive,
was murder, even under their own unlawful laws, for two of their own judges had pronounced
in my father's favour.

'Well, when the days of order came back again, my elder brother began to make inquiries about
this man. I was only a child then, but it was a family matter, and it was discussed in my presence.
The fellow's name was Carabin. He was one of Sansterre's Guard, and a noted duellist. A foreign
lady named the Baroness Straubenthal having been dragged before the Jacobins, he had gained
her liberty for her on the promise that she with her money and estates should be his. He had
married her, taken her name and title, and escaped out of France at the time of the fall of
Robespierre. What had become of him we had no means of learning.

'You will think, doubtless, that it would be easy for us to find him, since we had both his
name and his title. You must remember, however, that the Revolution left us without money,
and that without money such a search is very difficult. Then came the Empire, and it became
more difficult still, for, as you are aware, the Emperor considered that the 18th Brumaire
brought all accounts to a settlement, and that on that day a veil had been drawn across the
past. None the less, we kept our own family story and our own family plans.

'My brother joined the army, and passed with it through all Southern Europe, asking everywhere
for the Baron Straubenthal. Last October he was killed at Jena, with his mission still unfulfilled.
Then it became my turn, and I have the good fortune to hear of the very man of whom I am in
search at one of the first Polish villages which I have to visit, and within a fortnight of
joining my regiment. And then, to make the matter even better, I find myself in the company
of one whose name is never mentioned throughout the army save in connection with some daring
and generous deed.'

This was all very well, and I listened to it with the greatest interest, but I was none the
clearer as to what young Duroc wished me to do.

'How can I be of service to you?' I asked.

'By coming up with me.'

'To the Castle?'

'Precisely.'

'When?'

'At once.'

'But what do you intend to do?'

'I shall know what to do. But I wish you to be with me, all the same.'

Well, it was never in my nature to refuse an adventure, and, besides, I had every sympathy
with the lad's feelings. It is very well to forgive one's enemies, but one wishes to give them
something to forgive also. I held out my hand to him, therefore.

'I must be on my way for Rossel tomorrow morning, but tonight I am yours,' said I.

We left our troopers in snug quarters, and, as it was but a mile to the Castle, we did not
disturb our horses. To tell the truth, I hate to see a cavalry man walk, and I hold that just
as he is the most gallant thing upon earth when he has his saddle-flaps between his knees,
so he is the most clumsy when he has to loop up his sabre and his sabre-tasche in one hand
and turn in his toes for fear of catching the rowels of his spurs. Still, Duroc and I were
of the age when one can carry things off, and I dare swear that no woman at least would have
quarrelled with the appearance of the two young hussars, one in blue and one in grey, who set
out that night from the Arensdorf post-house. We both carried our swords, and for my own part
I slipped a pistol from my holster into the inside of my pelisse, for it seemed to me that
there might be some wild work before us.

The track which led to the Castle wound through a pitch-black fir-wood, where we could see
nothing save the ragged patch of stars above our heads. Presently, however, it opened up, and
there was the Castle right in front of us, about as far as a carbine would carry. It was a
huge, uncouth place, and bore every mark of being exceedingly old, with turrets at every corner,
and a square keep on the side which was nearest to us. In all its great shadow there was no
sign of light save from a single window, and no sound came from it. To me there was something
awful in its size and its silence, which corresponded so well with its sinister name. My companion
pressed on eagerly, and I followed him along the ill-kept path which led to the gate.

There was no bell or knocker upon the great iron-studded door, and it was only by pounding
with the hilts of our sabres that we could attract attention. A thin, hawk-faced man, with
a beard up to his temples, opened it at last. He carried a lantern in one hand, and in the
other a chain which held an enormous black hound. His manner at the first moment was threatening,
but the sight of our uniforms and of our faces turned it into one of sulky reserve.

'The Baron Straubenthal does not receive visitors at so late an hour,' said he, speaking in
very excellent French.

'You can inform Baron Straubenthal that I have come eight hundred leagues to see him, and that
I will not leave until I have done so,' said my companion. I could not myself have said it
with a better voice and manner.

The fellow took a sidelong look at us, and tugged at his black beard in his perplexity.

'To tell the truth, gentlemen,' said he, 'the Baron has a cup or two of wine in him at this
hour, and you would certainly find him a more entertaining companion if you were to come again
in the morning.'

He had opened the door a little wider as he spoke, and I saw by the light of the lamp in the
hall behind him that three other rough fellows were standing there, one of whom held another
of these monstrous hounds. Duroc must have seen it also, but it made no difference to his resolution.

'Enough talk,' said he, pushing the man to one side. 'It is with your master that I have to deal.'

The fellows in the hall made way for him as he strode in among them, so great is the power
of one man who knows what he wants over several who are not sure of themselves. My companion
tapped one of them upon the shoulder with as much assurance as though he owned him.

'Show me to the Baron,' said he.

The man shrugged his shoulders, and answered something in Polish. The fellow with the beard,
who had shut and barred the front door, appeared to be the only one among them who could speak
French.

'Well, you shall have your way,' said he, with a sinister smile. 'You shall see the Baron.
And perhaps, before you have finished, you will wish that you had taken my advice.'

We followed him down the hall, which was stone-flagged and very spacious, with skins scattered
upon the floor, and the heads of wild beasts upon the walls. At the farther end he threw open
a door, and we entered.

It was a small room, scantily furnished, with the same marks of neglect and decay which met
us at every turn. The walls were hung with discoloured tapestry, which had come loose at one
corner, so as to expose the rough stonework behind. A second door, hung with a curtain, faced
us upon the other side. Between lay a square table, strewn with dirty dishes and the sordid
remains of a meal. Several bottles were scattered over it. At the head of it, and facing us,
there sat a huge man with a lion-like head and a great shock of orange-coloured hair. His beard
was of the same glaring hue; matted and tangled and coarse as a horse's mane. I have seen some
strange faces in my time, but never one more brutal than that, with its small, vicious, blue
eyes, its white, crumpled cheeks, and the thick, hanging lip which protruded over his monstrous
beard. His head swayed about on his shoulders, and he looked at us with the vague, dim gaze
of a drunken man. Yet he was not so drunk but that our uniforms carried their message to him.

'Well, my brave boys,' he hiccoughed. 'What is the latest news from Paris, eh? You're going
to free Poland, I hear, and have meantime all become slaves yourselves--slaves to a little
aristocrat with his grey coat and his three-cornered hat. No more citizens either, I am told,
and nothing but monsieur and madame. My faith, some more heads will have to roll into the sawdust
basket some of these mornings.'

Duroc advanced in silence, and stood by the ruffian's side.

'Jean Carabin,' said he.

The Baron started, and the film of drunkenness seemed to be clearing from his eyes.

'Jean Carabin,' said Duroc, once more.

He sat up and grasped the arms of his chair.

'What do you mean by repeating that name, young man?' he asked.

'Jean Carabin, you are a man whom I have long wished to meet.'

'Supposing that I once had such a name, how can it concern you, since you must have been a
child when I bore it?'

'My name is Duroc.'

'Not the son of----?'

'The son of the man you murdered.'

The Baron tried to laugh, but there was terror in his eyes.

'We must let bygones be bygones, young man,' he cried. 'It was our life or theirs in those
days: the aristocrats or the people. Your father was of the Gironde. He fell. I was of the
mountain. Most of my comrades fell. It was all the fortune of war. We must forget all this
and learn to know each other better, you and I.' He held out a red, twitching hand as he spoke.

'Enough,' said young Duroc. 'If I were to pass my sabre through you as you sit in that chair,
I should do what is just and right. I dishonour my blade by crossing it with yours. And yet
you are a Frenchman, and have even held a commission under the same flag as myself. Rise, then,
and defend yourself!'

'Tut, tut!' cried the Baron. 'It is all very well for you young bloods--'

Duroc's patience could stand no more. He swung his open hand into the centre of the great orange
beard. I saw a lip fringed with blood, and two glaring blue eyes above it.

'You shall die for that blow.'

'That is better,' said Duroc.

'My sabre!' cried the other. 'I will not keep you waiting, I promise you!' and he hurried from
the room.

I have said that there was a second door covered with a curtain. Hardly had the Baron vanished
when there ran from behind it a woman, young and beautiful. So swiftly and noiselessly did
she move that she was between us in an instant, and it was only the shaking curtains which
told us whence she had come.

'I have seen it all,' she cried. 'Oh, sir, you have carried yourself splendidly.' She stooped
to my companion's hand, and kissed it again and again ere he could disengage it from her grasp.

'Nay, madame, why should you kiss my hand?' he cried.

'Because it is the hand which struck him on his vile, lying mouth. Because it may be the hand
which will avenge my mother. I am his step-daughter. The woman whose heart he broke was my
mother. I loathe him, I fear him. Ah, there is his step!' In an instant she had vanished as
suddenly as she had come. A moment later, the Baron entered with a drawn sword in his hand,
and the fellow who had admitted us at his heels.

'This is my secretary,' said he. 'He will be my friend in this affair. But we shall need more
elbow-room than we can find here. Perhaps you will kindly come with me to a more spacious apartment.'

It was evidently impossible to fight in a chamber which was blocked by a great table. We followed
him out, therefore, into the dimly-lit hall. At the farther end a light was shining through
an open door.

'We shall find what we want in here,' said the man with the dark beard. It was a large, empty
room, with rows of barrels and cases round the walls. A strong lamp stood upon a shelf in the
corner. The floor was level and true, so that no swordsman could ask for more. Duroc drew his
sabre and sprang into it. The Baron stood back with a bow and motioned me to follow my companion.
Hardly were my heels over the threshold when the heavy door crashed behind us and the key screamed
in the lock. We were taken in a trap.

For a moment we could not realize it. Such incredible baseness was outside all our experiences.
Then, as we understood how foolish we had been to trust for an instant a man with such a history,
a flush of rage came over us, rage against his villainy and against our own stupidity. We rushed
at the door together, beating it with our fists and kicking with our heavy boots. The sound
of our blows and of our execrations must have resounded through the Castle. We called to this
villain, hurling at him every name which might pierce even into his hardened soul. But the
door was enormous--such a door as one finds in mediaeval castles--made of huge beams clamped
together with iron. It was as easy to break as a square of the Old Guard. And our cries appeared
to be of as little avail as our blows, for they only brought for answer the clattering echoes
from the high roof above us. When you have done some soldiering, you soon learn to put up with
what cannot be altered. It was I, then, who first recovered my calmness, and prevailed upon
Duroc to join with me in examining the apartment which had become our dungeon.

There was only one window, which had no glass in it, and was so narrow that one could not so
much as get one's head through. It was high up, and Duroc had to stand upon a barrel in order
to see from it.

'What can you see?' I asked.

'Fir-woods and an avenue of snow between them,' said he. 'Ah!' he gave a cry of surprise.

I sprang upon the barrel beside him. There was, as he said, a long, clear strip of snow in
front. A man was riding down it, flogging his horse and galloping like a madman. As we watched,
he grew smaller and smaller, until he was swallowed up by the black shadows of the forest.

'What does that mean?' asked Duroc.

'No good for us,' said I. 'He may have gone for some brigands to cut our throats. Let us see
if we cannot find a way out of this mouse-trap before the cat can arrive.'

The one piece of good fortune in our favour was that beautiful lamp. It was nearly full of
oil, and would last us until morning. In the dark our situation would have been far more difficult.
By its light we proceeded to examine the packages and cases which lined the walls. In some
places there was only a single line of them, while in one corner they were piled nearly to
the ceiling. It seemed that we were in the storehouse of the Castle, for there were a great
number of cheeses, vegetables of various kinds, bins full of dried fruits, and a line of wine
barrels. One of these had a spigot in it, and as I had eaten little during the day, I was glad
of a cup of claret and some food. As to Duroc, he would take nothing, but paced up and down
the room in a fever of anger and impatience. 'I'll have him yet!' he cried, every now and then.
'The rascal shall not escape me!'

This was all very well, but it seemed to me, as I sat on a great round cheese eating my supper,
that this youngster was thinking rather too much of his own family affairs and too little of
the fine scrape into which he had got me. After all, his father had been dead fourteen years,
and nothing could set that right; but here was Etienne Gerard, the most dashing lieutenant
in the whole Grand Army, in imminent danger of being cut off at the very outset of his brilliant
career. Who was ever to know the heights to which I might have risen if I were knocked on the
head in this hole-and-corner business, which had nothing whatever to do with France or the
Emperor? I could not help thinking what a fool I had been, when I had a fine war before me
and everything which a man could desire, to go off on a hare-brained expedition of this sort,
as if it were not enough to have a quarter of a million Russians to fight against, without
plunging into all sorts of private quarrels as well.

'That is all very well,' I said at last, as I heard Duroc muttering his threats. 'You may do
what you like to him when you get the upper hand. At present the question rather is, what is
he going to do to us?'

'Let him do his worst!' cried the boy. 'I owe a duty to my father.'

'That is mere foolishness,' said I. 'If you owe a duty to your father, I owe one to my mother,
which is to get out of this business safe and sound.'

My remark brought him to his senses.

'I have thought too much of myself!' he cried. 'Forgive me, Monsieur Gerard. Give me your advice
as to what I should do.'

'Well,' said I, 'it is not for our health that they have shut us up here among the cheeses.
They mean to make an end of us if they can. That is certain. They hope that no one knows that
we have come here, and that none will trace us if we remain. Do your hussars know where you
have gone to?'

'I said nothing.'

'Hum! It is clear that we cannot be starved here. They must come to us if they are to kill
us. Behind a barricade of barrels we could hold our own against the five rascals whom we have
seen. That is, probably, why they have sent that messenger for assistance.'

'We must get out before he returns.'

'Precisely, if we are to get out at all.'

'Could we not burn down this door?' he cried.

'Nothing could be easier,' said I. 'There are several casks of oil in the corner. My only objection
is that we should ourselves be nicely toasted, like two little oyster pâtés.'

'Can you not suggest something?' he cried, in despair. 'Ah, what is that?'

There had been a low sound at our little window, and a shadow came between the stars and ourselves.
A small, white hand was stretched into the lamplight. Something glittered between the fingers.

'Quick! quick!' cried a woman's voice.

We were on the barrel in an instant.

'They have sent for the Cossacks. Your lives are at stake. Ah, I am lost! I am lost!'

There was the sound of rushing steps, a hoarse oath, a blow, and the stars were once more twinkling
through the window. We stood helpless upon the barrel with our blood cold with horror. Half
a minute afterwards we heard a smothered scream, ending in a choke. A great door slammed somewhere
in the silent night.

'Those ruffians have seized her. They will kill her,' I cried.

Duroc sprang down with the inarticulate shouts of one whose reason has left him. He struck
the door so frantically with his naked hands that he left a blotch of blood with every blow.

Here is the key!' I shouted, picking one from the floor. 'She must have thrown it in at the
instant that she was torn away.'

My companion snatched it from me with a shriek of joy. A moment later he dashed it down upon
the boards. It was so small that it was lost in the enormous lock. Duroc sank upon one of the
boxes with his head between his hands. He sobbed in his despair. I could have sobbed, too,
when I thought of the woman and how helpless we were to save her.

But I am not easily baffled. After all, this key must have been sent to us for a purpose. The
lady could not bring us that of the door, because this murderous step-father of hers would
most certainly have it in his pocket. Yet this other must have a meaning, or why should she
risk her life to place it in our hands? It would say little for our wits if we could not find
out what that meaning might be.

I set to work moving all the cases out from the wall, and Duroc, gaining new hope from my courage,
helped me with all his strength. It was no light task, for many of them were large and heavy.
On we went, working like maniacs, slinging barrels, cheeses, and boxes pell-mell into the middle
of the room. At last there only remained one huge barrel of vodka, which stood in the corner.
With our united strength we rolled it out, and there was a little low wooden door in the wainscot
behind it. The key fitted, and with a cry of delight we saw it swing open before us. With the
lamp in my hand, I squeezed my way in, followed by my companion.

We were in the powder-magazine of the Castle--a rough, walled cellar, with barrels all round
it, and one with the top staved in in the centre. The powder from it lay in a black heap upon
the floor. Beyond there was another door, but it was locked.

'We are no better off than before,' cried Duroc. 'We have no key.'

'We have a dozen!' I cried.

'Where?'

I pointed to the line of powder barrels.

'You would blow this door open?'

'Precisely.'

'But you would explode the magazine.'

It was true, but I was not at the end of my resources.

'We will blow open the store-room door,' I cried.

I ran back and seized a tin box which had been filled with candles. It was about the size of
my busby--large enough to hold several pounds of powder. Duroc filled it while I cut off the
end of a candle. When we had finished, it would have puzzled a colonel of engineers to make
a better petard. I put three cheeses on the top of each other and placed it above them, so
as to lean against the lock. Then we lit our candle-end and ran for shelter, shutting the door
of the magazine behind us.

It is no joke, my friends, to be among all those tons of powder, with the knowledge that if
the flame of the explosion should penetrate through one thin door our blackened limbs would
be shot higher than the Castle keep. Who could have believed that a half-inch of candle could
take so long to burn? My ears were straining all the time for the thudding of the hoofs of
the Cossacks who were coming to destroy us. I had almost made up my mind that the candle must
have gone out when there was a smack like a bursting bomb, our door flew to bits, and pieces
of cheese, with a shower of turnips, apples, and splinters of cases, were shot in among us.
As we rushed out we had to stagger through an impenetrable smoke, with all sorts of débris
beneath our feet, but there was a glimmering square where the dark door had been. The petard
had done its work.

In fact, it had done more for us than we had even ventured to hope. It had shattered gaolers
as well as gaol. The first thing that I saw as I came out into the hall was a man with a butcher's
axe in his hand, lying flat upon his back, with a gaping wound across his forehead. The second
was a huge dog, with two of its legs broken, twisting in agony upon the floor. As it raised
itself up I saw the two broken ends flapping like flails. At the same instant I heard a cry,
and there was Duroc, thrown against the wall, with the other hound's teeth in his throat. He
pushed it off with his left hand, while again and again he passed his sabre through its body,
but it was not until I blew out its brains with my pistol that the iron jaws relaxed, and the
fierce, bloodshot eyes were glazed in death.

There was no time for us to pause. A woman's scream from in front--a scream of mortal terror--told
us that even now we might be too late. There were two other men in the hall, but they cowered
away from our drawn swords and furious faces. The blood was streaming from Duroc's neck and
dyeing the grey fur of his pelisse. Such was the lad's fire, however, that he shot in front
of me, and it was only over his shoulder that I caught a glimpse of the scene as we rushed
into the chamber in which we had first seen the master of the Castle of Gloom.

The Baron was standing in the middle of the room, his tangled mane bristling like an angry
lion. He was, as I have said, a huge man with enormous shoulders; and as he stood there, with
his face flushed with rage and his sword advanced, I could not but think that, in spite of
all his villainies, he had a proper figure for a grenadier. The lady lay cowering in a chair
behind him. A weal across one of her white arms and a dog-whip upon the floor were enough to
show that our escape had hardly been in time to save her from his brutality. He gave a howl
like a wolf as we broke in, and was upon us in an instant, hacking and driving, with a curse
at every blow.

I have already said that the room gave no space for swordsmanship. My young companion was in
front of me in the narrow passage between the table and the wall, so that I could only look
on without being able to aid him. The lad knew something of his weapon, and was as fierce and
active as a wild cat, but in so narrow a space the weight and strength of the giant gave him
the advantage. Besides, he was an admirable swordsman. His parade and riposte were as quick
as lightning. Twice he touched Duroc upon the shoulder, and then, as the lad slipped on a lunge,
he whirled up his sword to finish him before he could recover his feet. I was quicker than
he, however, and took the cut upon the pommel of my sabre.

'Excuse me,' said I, 'but you have still to deal with Etienne Gerard.'

He drew back and leaned against the tapestry-covered wall, breathing in little, hoarse gasps,
for his foul living was against him.

'Take your breath,' said I. 'I will await your convenience.'

'You have no cause of quarrel against me,' he panted.

'I owe you some little attention,' said I, 'for having shut me up in your store-room. Besides,
if all other were wanting, I see cause enough upon that lady's arm.'

'Have your way, then!' he snarled, and leaped at me like a madman. For a minute I saw only
the blazing blue eyes, and the red glazed point which stabbed and stabbed, rasping off to right
or to left, and yet ever back at my throat and my breast. I had never thought that such good
sword-play was to be found at Paris in the days of the Revolution. I do not suppose that in
all my little affairs I have met six men who had a better knowledge of their weapon. But he
knew that I was his master. He read death in my eyes, and I could see that he read it. The
flush died from his face. His breath came in shorter and in thicker gasps. Yet he fought on,
even after the final thrust had come, and died still hacking and cursing, with foul cries upon
his lips, and his blood clotting upon his orange beard. I who speak to you have seen so many
battles, that my old memory can scarce contain their names, and yet of all the terrible sights
which these eyes have rested upon, there is none which I care to think of less than of that
orange beard with the crimson stain in the centre, from which I had drawn my sword-point.

It was only afterwards that I had time to think of all this. His monstrous body had hardly
crashed down upon the floor before the woman in the corner sprang to her feet, clapping her
hands together and screaming out in her delight. For my part I was disgusted to see a woman
take such delight in a deed of blood, and I gave no thought as to the terrible wrongs which
must have befallen her before she could so far forget the gentleness of her sex. It was on
my tongue to tell her sharply to be silent, when a strange, choking smell took the breath from
my nostrils, and a sudden, yellow glare brought out the figures upon the faded hangings.

'Duroc, Duroc!' I shouted, tugging at his shoulder. 'The Castle is on fire!'

The boy lay senseless upon the ground, exhausted by his wounds. I rushed out into the hall
to see whence the danger came. It was our explosion which had set alight to the dry frame-work
of the door. Inside the store-room some of the boxes were already blazing. I glanced in, and
as I did so my blood was turned to water by the sight of the powder barrels beyond, and of
the loose heap upon the floor. It might be seconds, it could not be more than minutes, before
the flames would be at the edge of it. These eyes will be closed in death, my friends, before
they cease to see those crawling lines of fire and the black heap beyond.

How little I can remember what followed. Vaguely I can recall how I rushed into the chamber
of death, how I seized Duroc by one limp hand and dragged him down the hall, the woman keeping
pace with me and pulling at the other arm. Out of the gateway we rushed, and on down the snow-covered
path until we were on the fringe of the fir forest. It was at that moment that I heard a crash
behind me, and, glancing round, saw a great spout of fire shoot up into the wintry sky. An
instant later there seemed to come a second crash, far louder than the first. I saw the fir
trees and the stars whirling round me, and I fell unconscious across the body of my comrade.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was some weeks before I came to myself in the post-house of Arensdorf, and longer still
before I could be told all that had befallen me. It was Duroc, already able to go soldiering,
who came to my bedside and gave me an account of it. He it was who told me how a piece of timber
had struck me on the head and laid me almost dead upon the ground. From him, too, I learned
how the Polish girl had run to Arensdorf, how she had roused our hussars, and how she had only
just brought them back in time to save us from the spears of the Cossacks who had been summoned
from their bivouac by that same black-bearded secretary whom we had seen galloping so swiftly
over the snow. As to the brave lady who had twice saved our lives, I could not learn very much
about her at that moment from Duroc, but when I chanced to meet him in Paris two years later,
after the campaign of Wagram, I was not very much surprised to find that I needed no introduction
to his bride, and that by the queer turns of fortune he had himself, had he chosen to use it,
that very name and title of the Baron Straubenthal, which showed him to be the owner of the
blackened ruins of the Castle of Gloom.

2. HOW THE BRIGADIER SLEW THE BROTHERS OF AJACCIO

When the Emperor needed an agent he was always very ready to do me the honour of recalling
the name of Etienne Gerard, though it occasionally escaped him when rewards were to be distributed.
Still, I was a colonel at twenty-eight, and the chief of a brigade at thirty-one, so that I
have no reason to be dissatisfied with my career. Had the wars lasted another two or three
years I might have grasped my bâton, and the man who had his hand upon that was only one stride
from a throne. Murat had changed his hussar's cap for a crown, and another light cavalry man
might have done as much. However, all those dreams were driven away by Waterloo, and, although
I was not able to write my name upon history, it is sufficiently well known by all who served
with me in the great wars of the Empire.

What I want to tell you tonight is about the very singular affair which first started me upon
my rapid upward course, and which had the effect of establishing a secret bond between the
Emperor and myself.

There is just one little word of warning which I must give you before I begin. When you hear
me speak, you must always bear in mind that you are listening to one who has seen history from
the inside. I am talking about what my ears have heard and my eyes have seen, so you must not
try to confute me by quoting the opinions of some student or man of the pen, who has written
a book of history or memoirs. There is much which is unknown by such people, and much which
never will be known by the world. For my own part, I could tell you some very surprising things
were it discreet to do so. The facts which I am about to relate to you tonight were kept secret
by me during the Emperor's lifetime, because I gave him my promise that it should be so, but
I do not think that there can be any harm now in my telling the remarkable part which I played.

You must know, then, that at the time of the Treaty of Tilsit I was a simple lieutenant in
the 10th Hussars, without money or interest. It is true that my appearance and my gallantry
were in my favour, and that I had already won a reputation as being one of the best swordsmen
in the army; but amongst the host of brave men who surrounded the Emperor it needed more than
this to insure a rapid career. I was confident, however, that my chance would come, though
I never dreamed that it would take so remarkable a form.

When the Emperor returned to Paris, after the declaration of peace in the year 1807, he spent
much of his time with the Empress and the Court at Fontainebleau. It was the time when he was
at the pinnacle of his career. He had in three successive campaigns humbled Austria, crushed
Prussia, and made the Russians very glad to get upon the right side of the Niemen. The old
Bulldog over the Channel was still growling, but he could not get very far from his kennel.
If we could have made a perpetual peace at that moment, France would have taken a higher place
than any nation since the days of the Romans. So I have heard the wise folk say, though for
my part I had other things to think of. All the girls were glad to see the army back after
its long absence, and you may be sure that I had my share of any favours that were going. You
may judge how far I was a favourite in those days when I say that even now, in my sixtieth
year--but why should I dwell upon that which is already sufficiently well known?

Our regiment of hussars was quartered with the horse chasseurs of the guard at Fontainebleau.
It is, as you know, but a little place, buried in the heart of the forest, and it was wonderful
at this time to see it crowded with Grand Dukes and Electors and Princes, who thronged round
Napoleon like puppies round their master, each hoping that some bone might be thrown to him.
There was more German than French to be heard in the street, for those who had helped us in
the late war had come to beg for a reward, and those who had opposed us had come to try and
escape their punishment.

And all the time our little man, with his pale face and his cold, grey eyes, was riding to
the hunt every morning, silent and brooding, all of them following in his train, in the hope
that some word would escape him. And then, when the humour seized him, he would throw a hundred
square miles to that man, or tear as much off the other, round off one kingdom by a river,
or cut off another by a chain of mountains. That was how he used to do business, this little
artilleryman, whom we had raised so high with our sabres and our bayonets. He was very civil
to us always, for he knew where his power came from. We knew also, and showed it by the way
in which we carried ourselves. We were agreed, you understand, that he was the finest leader
in the world, but we did not forget that he had the finest men to lead.

Well, one day I was seated in my quarters playing cards with young Morat, of the horse chasseurs,
when the door opened and in walked Lasalle, who was our Colonel. You know what a fine, swaggering
fellow he was, and the sky-blue uniform of the Tenth suited him to a marvel. My faith, we youngsters
were so taken by him that we all swore and diced and drank and played the deuce whether we
liked it or no, just that we might resemble our Colonel! We forgot that it was not because
he drank or gambled that the Emperor was going to make him the head of the light cavalry, but
because he had the surest eye for the nature of a position or for the strength of a column,
and the best judgment as to when infantry could be broken, or whether guns were exposed, of
any man in the army. We were too young to understand all that, however, so we waxed our moustaches
and clicked our spurs and let the ferrules of our scabbards wear out by trailing them along
the pavement in the hope that we should all become Lasalles. When he came clanking into my
quarters, both Morat and I sprang to our feet.

'My boy,' said he, clapping me on the shoulder, 'the Emperor wants to see you at four o'clock.'

The room whirled round me at the words, and I had to lean my hands upon the edge of the card-table.

'What?' I cried. 'The Emperor!'

'Precisely,' said he, smiling at my astonishment.

'But the Emperor does not know of my existence, Colonel,' I protested. 'Why should he send for me?'

'Well, that's just what puzzles me,' cried Lasalle, twirling his moustache. 'If he wanted the
help of a good sabre, why should he descend to one of my lieutenants when he might have found
all that he needed at the head of the regiment? However,' he added, clapping me on the shoulder
again in his hearty fashion, 'every man has his chance. I have had mine, otherwise I should
not be Colonel of the Tenth. I must not grudge you yours. Forwards, my boy, and may it be the
first step towards changing your busby for a cocked hat.'

It was but two o'clock, so he left me, promising to come back and to accompany me to the palace.
My faith, what a time I passed, and how many conjectures did I make as to what it was that
the Emperor could want of me! I paced up and down my little room in a fever of anticipation.
Sometimes I thought that perhaps he had heard of the guns which we had taken at Austerlitz;
but, then, there were so many who had taken guns at Austerlitz, and two years had passed since
the battle. Or it might be that he wished to reward me for my affair with the aide-de-camp
of the Russian Emperor. But then again a cold fit would seize me, and I would fancy that he
had sent for me to reprimand me. There were a few duels which he might have taken in ill part,
and there were one or two little jokes in Paris since the peace.

But, no! I considered the words of Lasalle. 'If he had need of a brave man,' said Lasalle.

It was obvious that my Colonel had some idea of what was in the wind. If he had not known that
it was to my advantage, he would not have been so cruel as to congratulate me. My heart glowed
with joy as this conviction grew upon me, and I sat down to write to my mother and to tell
her that the Emperor was waiting, at that very moment, to have my opinion upon a matter of
importance. It made me smile as I wrote it to think that, wonderful as it appeared to me, it
would probably only confirm my mother in her opinion of the Emperor's good sense.

At half-past three I heard a sabre come clanking against every step of my wooden stair. It
was Lasalle, and with him was a lame gentleman, very neatly dressed in black with dapper ruffles
and cuffs. We did not know many civilians, we of the army, but, my word, this was one whom
we could not afford to ignore! I had only to glance at those twinkling eyes, the comical, upturned
nose, and the straight, precise mouth, to know that I was in the presence of the one man in
France whom even the Emperor had to consider.

'This is Monsieur Etienne Gerard, Monsieur de Talleyrand,' said Lasalle.

I saluted, and the statesman took me in from the top of my panache to the rowel of my spur,
with a glance that played over me like a rapier point.

'Have you explained to the lieutenant the circumstances under which he is summoned to the Emperor's
presence?' he asked, in his dry, creaking voice.

They were such a contrast, these two men, that I could not help glancing from one to the other
of them: the black, sly politician, and the big, sky-blue hussar with one fist on his hip and
the other on the hilt of his sabre. They both took their seats as I looked, Talleyrand without
a sound, and Lasalle with a clash and a jingle like a prancing charger.

'It's this way, youngster,' said he, in his brusque fashion; 'I was with the Emperor in his
private cabinet this morning when a note was brought in to him. He opened it, and as he did
so he gave such a start that it fluttered down on to the floor. I handed it up to him again,
but he was staring at the wall in front of him as if he had seen a ghost. "Fratelli dell' Ajaccio,"
he muttered; and then again, "Fratelli dell' Ajaccio." I don't pretend to know more Italian
than a man can pick up in two campaigns, and I could make nothing of this. It seemed to me
that he had gone out of his mind; and you would have said so also, Monsieur de Talleyrand,
if you had seen the look in his eyes. He read the note, and then he sat for half an hour or
more without moving.'

'And you?' asked Talleyrand.

'Why, I stood there not knowing what I ought to do. Presently he seemed to come back to his senses.

'"I suppose, Lasalle," said he, "that you have some gallant young officers in the Tenth?"

'"They are all that, sire," I answered.

'"If you had to pick one who was to be depended upon for action, but who would not think too
much--you understand me, Lasalle--which would you select?" he asked.

'I saw that he needed an agent who would not penetrate too deeply into his plans.

'"I have one," said I, "who is all spurs and moustaches, with never a thought beyond women
and horses."

'"That is the man I want," said Napoleon. "Bring him to my private cabinet at four o'clock."

'So, youngster, I came straight away to you at once, and mind that you do credit to the 10th
Hussars.'

I was by no means flattered by the reasons which had led to my Colonel's choice, and I must
have shown as much in my face, for he roared with laughter and Talleyrand gave a dry chuckle also.

'Just one word of advice before you go, Monsieur Gerard,' said he: 'you are now coming into
troubled waters, and you might find a worse pilot than myself. We have none of us any idea
as to what this little affair means, and, between ourselves, it is very important for us, who
have the destinies of France upon our shoulders, to keep ourselves in touch with all that goes
on. You understand me, Monsieur Gerard?'

I had not the least idea what he was driving at, but I bowed and tried to look as if it was
clear to me.

'Act very guardedly, then, and say nothing to anybody,' said Talleyrand. 'Colonel de Lasalle
and I will not show ourselves in public with you, but we will await you here, and we will give
you our advice when you have told us what has passed between the Emperor and yourself. It is
time that you started now, for the Emperor never forgives unpunctuality.'

Off I went on foot to the palace, which was only a hundred paces off. I made my way to the
ante-chamber, where Duroc, with his grand new scarlet and gold coat, was fussing about among
the crowd of people who were waiting. I heard him whisper to Monsieur de Caulaincourt that
half of them were German Dukes who expected to be made Kings, and the other half German Dukes
who expected to be made paupers. Duroc, when he heard my name, showed me straight in, and I
found myself in the Emperor's presence.

I had, of course, seen him in camp a hundred times, but I had never been face to face with
him before. I have no doubt that if you had met him without knowing in the least who he was,
you would simply have said that he was a sallow little fellow with a good forehead and fairly
well-turned calves. His tight white cashmere breeches and white stockings showed off his legs
to advantage. But even a stranger must have been struck by the singular look of his eyes, which
could harden into an expression which would frighten a grenadier. It is said that even Auguereau,
who was a man who had never known what fear was, quailed before Napoleon's gaze, at a time,
too, when the Emperor was but an unknown soldier. He looked mildly enough at me, however, and
motioned me to remain by the door. De Meneval was writing to his dictation, looking up at him
between each sentence with his spaniel eyes.

'That will do. You can go,' said the Emperor, abruptly. Then, when the secretary had left the
room, he strode across with his hands behind his back, and he looked me up and down without
a word. Though he was a small man himself, he was very fond of having fine-looking fellows
about him, and so I think that my appearance gave him pleasure. For my own part, I raised one
hand to the salute and held the other upon the hilt of my sabre, looking straight ahead of
me, as a soldier should.

'Well, Monsieur Gerard,' said he, at last, tapping his forefinger upon one of the brandebourgs
of gold braid upon the front of my pelisse, 'I am informed that you are a very deserving young
officer. Your Colonel gives me an excellent account of you.'

I wished to make a brilliant reply, but I could think of nothing save Lasalle's phrase that
I was all spurs and moustaches, so it ended in my saying nothing at all. The Emperor watched
the struggle which must have shown itself upon my features, and when, finally, no answer came
he did not appear to be displeased.

'I believe that you are the very man that I want,' said he. 'Brave and clever men surround
me upon every side. But a brave man who----' He did not finish his sentence, and for my own
part I could not understand what he was driving at. I contented myself with assuring him that
he could count upon me to the death.

'You are, as I understand, a good swordsman?' said he.

'Tolerable, sire,' I answered.

'You were chosen by your regiment to fight the champion of the Hussars of Chambarant?' said he.

I was not sorry to find that he knew so much of my exploits.

'My comrades, sire, did me that honour,' said I.

'And for the sake of practice you insulted six fencing masters in the week before your duel?'

'I had the privilege of being out seven times in as many days, sire,' said I.

'And escaped without a scratch?'

'The fencing master of the 23rd Light Infantry touched me on the left elbow, sire.'

'Let us have no more child's play of the sort, monsieur,' he cried, turning suddenly to that
cold rage of his which was so appalling. 'Do you imagine that I place veteran soldiers in these
positions that you may practise quarte and tierce upon them? How am I to face Europe if my
soldiers turn their points upon each other? Another word of your duelling, and I break you
between these fingers.'

I saw his plump white hands flash before my eyes as he spoke, and his voice had turned to the
most discordant hissing and growling. My word, my skin pringled all over as I listened to him,
and I would gladly have changed my position for that of the first man in the steepest and narrowest
breach that ever swallowed up a storming party. He turned to the table, drank off a cup of
coffee, and then when he faced me again every trace of this storm had vanished, and he wore
that singular smile which came from his lips but never from his eyes.

'I have need of your services, Monsieur Gerard,' said he. 'I may be safer with a good sword
at my side, and there are reasons why yours should be the one which I select. But first of
all I must bind you to secrecy. Whilst I live what passes between us today must be known to
none but ourselves.'

I thought of Talleyrand and of Lasalle, but I promised.

'In the next place, I do not want your opinions or conjectures, and I wish you to do exactly
what you are told.'

I bowed.

'It is your sword that I need, and not your brains. I will do the thinking. Is that clear to you?'

'Yes, sire.'

'You know the Chancellor's Grove, in the forest?'

I bowed.

'You know also the large double fir-tree where the hounds assembled on Tuesday?'

Had he known that I met a girl under it three times a week, he would not have asked me. I bowed
once more without remark.

'Very good. You will meet me there at ten o'clock tonight.'

I had got past being surprised at anything which might happen. If he had asked me to take his
place upon the imperial throne I could only have nodded my busby.

'We shall then proceed into the wood together,' said the Emperor. 'You will be armed with a
sword, but not with pistols. You must address no remark to me, and I shall say nothing to you.
We will advance in silence. You understand?'

'I understand, sire.'

'After a time we shall see a man, or more probably two men, under a certain tree. We shall
approach them together. If I signal to you to defend me, you will have your sword ready. If,
on the other hand, I speak to these men, you will wait and see what happens. If you are called
upon to draw, you must see that neither of them, in the event of there being two, escapes from
us. I shall myself assist you.'

'Sire,' I cried, 'I have no doubt that two would not be too many for my sword; but would it
not be better that I should bring a comrade than that you should be forced to join in such
a struggle?'

'Ta, ta, ta,' said he. 'I was a soldier before I was an Emperor. Do you think, then, that artillerymen
have not swords as well as the hussars? But I ordered you not to argue with me. You will do
exactly what I tell you. If swords are once out, neither of these men is to get away alive.'

'They shall not, sire,' said I.

'Very good. I have no more instructions for you. You can go.'

I turned to the door, and then an idea occurring to me I turned.

'I have been thinking, sire--' said I.

He sprang at me with the ferocity of a wild beast. I really thought he would have struck me.

'Thinking!' he cried. 'You, you! Do you imagine I chose you out because you could think? Let
me hear of your doing such a thing again! You, the one man--but, there! You meet me at the
fir-tree at ten o'clock.'

My faith, I was right glad to get out of the room. If I have a good horse under me, and a sword
clanking against my stirrup-iron, I know where I am. And in all that relates to green fodder
or dry, barley and oats and rye, and the handling of squadrons upon the march, there is no
one who can teach me very much. But when I meet a Chamberlain and a Marshal of the Palace,
and have to pick my words with an Emperor, and find that everybody hints instead of talking
straight out, I feel like a troop-horse who has been put in a lady's calèche. It is not my
trade, all this mincing and pretending. I have learned the manners of a gentleman, but never
those of a courtier. I was right glad then to get into the fresh air again, and I ran away
up to my quarters like a schoolboy who has just escaped from the seminary master.

But as I opened the door, the very first thing that my eye rested upon was a long pair of sky-blue
legs with hussar boots, and a short pair of black ones with knee breeches and buckles. They
both sprang up together to greet me.

'Well, what news?' they cried, the two of them.

'None,' I answered.

'The Emperor refused to see you?'

'No, I have seen him.'

'And what did he say?'

'Monsieur de Talleyrand,' I answered, 'I regret to say that it is quite impossible for me to
tell you anything about it. I have promised the Emperor.'

'Pooh, pooh, my dear young man,' said he, sidling up to me, as a cat does when it is about
to rub itself against you. 'This is all among friends, you understand, and goes no farther

'As long as I live,' said he, 'you never open your lips upon this subject.'

'I dismiss it entirely from my mind, sire. I will efface it from my recollection as if it had

I entered it at four o'clock.'

'You cannot do that,' said the Emperor, smiling. 'You were a lieutenant at that time. You will

3. HOW THE BRIGADIER HELD THE KING

Here, upon the lapel of my coat, you may see the ribbon of my decoration, but the medal itself
I keep in a leathern pouch at home, and I never venture to take it out unless one of the modern
peace generals, or some foreigner of distinction who finds himself in our little town, takes
advantage of the opportunity to pay his respects to the well-known Brigadier Gerard. Then I
place it upon my breast, and I give my moustache the old Marengo twist which brings a grey
point into either eye. Yet with it all I fear that neither they, nor you either, my friends,
will ever realize the man that I was. You know me only as a civilian--with an air and a manner,
it is true--but still merely as a civilian. Had you seen me as I stood in the doorway of the
inn at Alamo, on the 1st of July, in the year 1810, you would then have known what the hussar
may attain to.

For a month I had lingered in that accursed village, and all on account of a lance-thrust in
my ankle, which made it impossible for me to put my foot to the ground. There were three besides
myself at first: old Bouvet, of the Hussars of Bercheny, Jacques Regnier, of the Cuirassiers,
and a funny little voltigeur captain whose name I forget; but they all got well and hurried
on to the front, while I sat gnawing my fingers and tearing my hair, and even, I must confess,
weeping from time to time as I thought of my Hussars of Conflans, and the deplorable condition
in which they must find themselves when deprived of their colonel. I was not a chief of brigade
yet, you understand, although I already carried myself like one, but I was the youngest colonel
in the whole service, and my regiment was wife and children to me. It went to my heart that
they should be so bereaved. It is true that Villaret, the senior major, was an excellent soldier;
but still, even among the best there are degrees of merit.

Ah, that happy July day of which I speak, when first I limped to the door and stood in the
golden Spanish sunshine! It was but the evening before that I had heard from the regiment.
They were at Pastores, on the other side of the mountains, face to face with the English--not
forty miles from me by road. But how was I to get to them? The same thrust which had pierced
my ankle had slain my charger. I took advice both from Gomez, the landlord, and from an old
priest who had slept that night in the inn, but neither of them could do more than assure me
that there was not so much as a colt left upon the whole countryside.

The landlord would not hear of my crossing the mountains without an escort, for he assured
me that El Cuchillo, the Spanish guerilla chief, was out that way with his band, and that it
meant a death by torture to fall into his hands. The old priest observed, however, that he
did not think a French hussar would be deterred by that, and if I had had any doubts, they
would of course have been decided by his remark.

But a horse! How was I to get one? I was standing in the doorway, plotting and planning, when
I heard the clink of shoes, and, looking up, I saw a great bearded man, with a blue cloak frogged
across in military fashion, coming towards me. He was riding a big black horse with one white
stocking on his near fore-leg.

'Halloa, comrade!' said I, as he came up to me.

'Halloa!' said he.

'I am Colonel Gerard, of the Hussars,' said I. 'I have lain here wounded for a month, and I
am now ready to rejoin my regiment at Pastores.'

'I am Monsieur Vidal, of the commissariat,' he answered, 'and I am myself upon my way to Pastores.
I should be glad to have your company, Colonel, for I hear that the mountains are far from safe.'

'Alas,' said I, 'I have no horse. But if you will sell me yours, I will promise that an escort
of hussars shall be sent back for you.'

He would not hear of it, and it was in vain that the landlord told him dreadful stories of
the doings of El Cuchillo, and that I pointed out the duty which he owed to the army and to
the country. He would not even argue, but called loudly for a cup of wine. I craftily asked
him to dismount and to drink with me, but he must have seen something in my face, for he shook
his head; and then, as I approached him with some thought of seizing him by the leg, he jerked
his heels into his horse's flanks, and was off in a cloud of dust.

My faith! it was enough to make a man mad to see this fellow riding away so gaily to join his
beef-barrels, and his brandy-casks, and then to think of my five hundred beautiful hussars
without their leader. I was gazing after him with bitter thoughts in my mind, when who should
touch me on the elbow but the little priest whom I have mentioned.

'It is I who can help you,' he said. 'I am myself travelling south.'

I put my arms about him and, as my ankle gave way at the same moment, we nearly rolled upon
the ground together.

'Get me to Pastores,' I cried, 'and you shall have a rosary of golden beads.' I had taken one
from the Convent of Spiritu Santo. It shows how necessary it is to take what you can when you
are upon a campaign, and how the most unlikely things may become useful.

'I will take you,' he said, in very excellent French, 'not because I hope for any reward, but
because it is my way always to do what I can to serve my fellow-man, and that is why I am so
beloved wherever I go.'

With that he led me down the village to an old cow-house, in which we found a tumble-down sort
of diligence, such as they used to run early in this century, between some of our remote villages.
There were three old mules, too, none of which were strong enough to carry a man, but together
they might draw the coach. The sight of their gaunt ribs and spavined legs gave me more delight
than the whole two hundred and twenty hunters of the Emperor which I have seen in their stalls
at Fontainebleau. In ten minutes the owner was harnessing them into the coach, with no very
good will, however, for he was in mortal dread of this terrible Cuchillo. It was only by promising
him riches in this world, while the priest threatened him with perdition in the next, that
we at last got him safely upon the box with the reins between his fingers. Then he was in such
a hurry to get off, out of fear lest we should find ourselves in the dark in the passes, that
he hardly gave me time to renew my vows to the innkeeper's daughter. I cannot at this moment
recall her name, but we wept together as we parted, and I can remember that she was a very
beautiful woman. You will understand, my friends, that when a man like me, who has fought the
men and kissed the women in fourteen separate kingdoms, gives a word of praise to the one or
the other, it has a little meaning of its own.

The little priest had seemed a trifle grave when we kissed good-bye, but he soon proved himself
the best of companions in the diligence. All the way he amused me with tales of his little
parish up in the mountains, and I in my turn told him stories about the camp; but, my faith,
I had to pick my steps, for when I said a word too much he would fidget in his seat and his
face would show the pain that I had given him. And of course it is not the act of a gentleman
to talk in anything but a proper manner to a religious man, though, with all the care in the
world, one's words may get out of hand sometimes.

He had come from the north of Spain, as he told me, and was going to see his mother in a village
of Estremadura, and as he spoke about her little peasant home, and her joy in seeing him, it
brought my own mother so vividly to my thoughts that the tears started to my eyes. In his simplicity
he showed me the little gifts which he was taking to her, and so kindly was his manner that
I could readily believe him when he said he was loved wherever he went. He examined my own
uniform with as much curiosity as a child, admiring the plume of my busby, and passing his
fingers through the sable with which my dolman was trimmed. He drew my sword, too, and then
when I told him how many men I had cut down with it, and set my finger on the notch made by
the shoulder-bone of the Russian Emperor's aide-de-camp, he shuddered and placed the weapon
under the leathern cushion, declaring that it made him sick to look at it.

Well, we had been rolling and creaking on our way whilst this talk had been going forward,
and as we reached the base of the mountains we could hear the rumbling of cannon far away upon
the right. This came from Massena, who was, as I knew, besieging Ciudad Rodrigo. There was
nothing I should have wished better than to have gone straight to him, for if, as some said,
he had Jewish blood in his veins, he was the best Jew that I have heard of since Joshua's time.
If you were in sight of his beaky nose and bold, black eyes, you were not likely to miss much
of what was going on. Still, a siege is always a poor sort of a pick-and-shovel business, and
there were better prospects with my hussars in front of the English. Mat who had to be weave from

 As to this reptile, who had acted
the priest so cleverly and had told me so much of his parish and his mother, he, of course,
had known where the ambuscade was laid, and had attempted to put me beyond all resistance at
the moment when we reached it.

I cannot tell you how frantic their rage was when they drew him out of the coach and saw the
state to which I had reduced him. If he had not got all his deserts, he had, at least, something
as a souvenir of his meeting with Etienne Gerard, for his legs dangled aimlessly about, and
though the upper part of his body was convulsed with rage and pain, he sat straight down upon
his feet when they tried to set him upright. But all the time his two little black eyes, which
had seemed so kindly and so innocent in the coach, were glaring at me like a wounded cat, and
he spat, and spat, and spat in my direction. My faith! when the wretches jerked me on to my
feet again, and when I was dragged off up one of the mountain paths, I understood that a time
was coming when I was to need all my courage and resource. My enemy was carried upon the shoulders
of two men behind me, and I could hear his hissing and his reviling, first in one ear and then
in the other, as I was hurried up the winding track.

I suppose that it must have been for an hour that we ascended, and what with my wounded ankle
and the pain from my eye, and the fear lest this wound should have spoiled my appearance, I
have made no journey to which I look back with less pleasure. I have never been a good climber
at any time, but it is astonishing what you can do, even with a stiff ankle, when you have
a copper-coloured brigand at each elbow and a nine-inch blade within touch of your whiskers.

We came at last to a place where the path wound over a ridge, and descended upon the other
side through thick pine-trees into a valley which opened to the south. In time of peace I had
little doubt that the villains were all smugglers, and that these were the secret paths by
which they crossed the Portuguese frontier. There were many mule-tracks, and once I was surprised
to see the marks of a large horse where a stream had softened the track. These were explained
when, on reaching a place where there was a clearing in the fir wood, I saw the animal itself
haltered to a fallen tree. My eyes had hardly rested upon it, when I recognized the great black
limbs and the white near fore-leg. It was the very horse which I had begged for in the morning.

What, then, had become of Commissariat Vidal? Was it possible that there was another Frenchman
in as perilous a plight as myself? The thought had hardly entered my head when our party stopped
and one of them uttered a peculiar cry. It was answered from among the brambles which lined
the base of a cliff at one side of a clearing, and an instant later ten or a dozen more brigands
came out from amongst them, and the two parties greeted each other. The new-comers surrounded
my friend of the brad-awl with cries of grief and sympathy, and then, turning upon me, they
brandished their knives and howled at me like the gang of assassins that they were. So frantic
were their gestures that I was convinced that my end had come, and was just bracing myself
to meet it in a manner which should be worthy of my past reputation, when one of them gave
an order and I was dragged roughly across the little glade to the brambles from which this
new band had emerged.

A narrow pathway led through them to a deep grotto in the side of the cliff. The sun was already
setting outside, and in the cave itself it would have been quite dark but for a pair of torches
which blazed from a socket on either side. Between them there was sitting at a rude table a
very singular-looking person, whom I saw instantly, from the respect with which the others
addressed him, could be none other than the brigand chief who had received, on account of his
dreadful character, the sinister name of El Cuchillo.

The man whom I had injured had been carried in and placed upon the top of a barrel, his helpless
legs dangling about in front of him, and his cat's eyes still darting glances of hatred at
me. I understood, from the snatches of talk which I could follow between the chief and him,
that he was the lieutenant of the band, and that part of his duties was to lie in wait with
his smooth tongue and his peaceful garb for travellers like myself. When I thought of how many
gallant officers may have been lured to their death by this monster of hypocrisy, it gave me
a glow of pleasure to think that I had brought his villainies to an end--though I feared it
would be at the price of a life which neither the Emperor nor the army could well spare.

As the injured man still supported upon the barrel by two comrades, was explaining in Spanish
all that had befallen him, I was held by several of the villains in front of the table at which
the chief was seated, and had an excellent opportunity of observing him. I have seldom seen
any man who was less like my idea of a brigand, and especially of a brigand with such a reputation
that in a land of cruelty he had earned so dark a nickname. His face was bluff and broad and
bland, with ruddy cheeks and comfortable little tufts of side-whiskers, which gave him the
appearance of a well-to-do grocer of the Rue St Antoine. He had not any of those flaring sashes
or gleaming weapons which distinguished his followers, but on the contrary he wore a good broadcloth
coat like a respectable father of a family, and save for his brown leggings there was nothing
to indicate a life among the mountains. His surroundings, too, corresponded with himself, and
beside his snuff-box upon the table there stood a great brown book, which looked like a commercial
ledger. Many other books were ranged along a plank between two powder-casks, and there was
a great litter of papers, some of which had verses scribbled upon them. All this I took in
while he, leaning indolently back in his chair, was listening to the report of his lieutenant.
Having heard everything, he ordered the cripple to be carried out again, and I was left with
my three guards, waiting to hear my fate. He took up his pen, and tapping his forehead with
the handle of it, he pursed up his lips and looked out of the corner of his eyes at the roof
of the grotto.

'I suppose,' said he at last, speaking very excellent French, 'that you are not able to suggest
a rhyme for the word Covilha.'

I answered him that my acquaintance with the Spanish language was so limited that I was unable
to oblige him.

'It is a rich language,' said he, 'but less prolific in rhymes than either the German or the
English. That is why our best work has been done in blank verse, a form of composition which
is capable of reaching great heights. But I fear that such subjects are somewhat outside the
range of a hussar.'

I was about to answer that if they were good enough for a guerilla, they could not be too much
for the light cavalry, but he was already stooping over his half-finished verse. Presently
he threw down the pen with an exclamation of satisfaction, and declaimed a few lines which
drew a cry of approval from the three ruffians who held me. His broad face blushed like a young
girl who receives her first compliment.

'The critics are in my favour, it appears,' said he; 'we amuse ourselves in our long evenings
by singing our own ballads, you understand. I have some little facility in that direction,
and I do not at all despair of seeing some of my poor efforts in print before long, and with
"Madrid" upon the title-page, too. But we must get back to business. May I ask what your name is?'

'Etienne Gerard.'

'Rank?'

'Colonel.'

'Corps?'

'The Third Hussars of Conflans.'

'You are young for a colonel.'

'My career has been an eventful one.'

'Tut, that makes it the sadder,' said he, with his bland smile.

I made no answer to that, but I tried to show him by my bearing that I was ready for the worst
which could befall me.

'By the way, I rather fancy that we have had some of your corps here,' said he, turning over
the pages of his big brown register. 'We endeavour to keep a record of our operations. Here
is a heading under June 24th. Have you not a young officer named Soubiron, a tall, slight youth
with light hair?'

'Certainly.'

'I see that we buried him upon that date.'

'Poor lad!' I cried. 'And how did he die?'

'We buried him.'

'But before you buried him?'

'You misunderstand me, Colonel. He was not dead before we buried him.'

'You buried him alive!'

For a moment I was too stunned to act. Then I hurled myself upon the man, as he sat with that
placid smile of his upon his lips, and I would have torn his throat out had the three wretches
not dragged me away from him. Again and again I made for him, panting and cursing, shaking
off this man and that, straining and wrenching, but never quite free. At last, with my jacket
torn nearly off my back and blood dripping from my wrists, I was hauled backwards in the bight
of a rope and cords passed round my ankles and my arms.

'You sleek hound!' I cried. 'If ever I have you at my sword's point, I will teach you to maltreat
one of my lads. You will find, you bloodthirsty beast, that my Emperor has long arms, and though
you lie here like a rat in its hole, the time will come when he will tear you out of it, and
you and your vermin will perish together.'

My faith, I have a rough side to my tongue, and there was not a hard word that I had learned
in fourteen campaigns which I did not let fly at him; but he sat with the handle of his pen
tapping against his forehead and his eyes squinting up at the roof as if he had conceived the
idea of some new stanza. It was this occupation of his which showed me how I might get my point
into him.

'You spawn!' said I; 'you think that you are safe here, but your life may be as short as that
of your absurd verses, and God knows that it could not be shorter than that.'

Ah, you should have seen him bound from his chair when I said the words. This vile monster,
who dispensed death and torture as a grocer serves out his figs, had one raw nerve then which
I could prod at pleasure. His face grew livid, and those little bourgeois side-whiskers quivered
and thrilled with passion.

'Very good, Colonel. You have said enough,' he cried, in a choking voice. 'You say that you
have had a very distinguished career. I promise you also a very distinguished ending. Colonel
Etienne Gerard of the Third Hussars shall have a death of his own.'

'And I only beg,' said I, 'that you will not commemorate it in verse.' I had one or two little
ironies to utter, but he cut me short by a furious gesture which caused my three guards to
drag me from the cave.

Our interview, which I have told you as nearly as I can remember it, must have lasted some
time, for it was quite dark when we came out, and the moon was shining very clearly in the
heavens. The brigands had lighted a great fire of the dried branches of the fir-trees; not,
of course, for warmth, since the night was already very sultry, but to cook their evening meal.
A huge copper pot hung over the blaze, and the rascals were lying all round in the yellow glare,
so that the scene looked like one of those pictures which Junot stole out of Madrid. There
are some soldiers who profess to care nothing for art and the like, but I have always been
drawn towards it myself, in which respect I show my good taste and my breeding. I remember,
for example, that when Lefebvre was selling the plunder after the fall of Danzig, I bought
a very fine picture, called 'Nymphs Surprised in a Wood,' and I carried it with me through
two campaigns, until my charger had the misfortune to put his hoof through it.

I only tell you this, however, to show you that I was never a mere rough soldier like Rapp
or Ney. As I lay in that brigands' camp, I had little time or inclination to think about such
matters. They had thrown me down under a tree, the three villains squatting round and smoking
their cigarettes within hands' touch of me. What to do I could not imagine. In my whole career
I do not suppose that I have ten times been in as hopeless a situation. 'But courage,' thought
I. 'Courage, my brave boy! You were not made a Colonel of Hussars at twenty-eight because you
could dance a cotillon. You are a picked man, Etienne; a man who has come through more than
two hundred affairs, and this little one is surely not going to be the last.' I began eagerly
to glance about for some chance of escape, and as I did so I saw something which filled me
with great astonishment.

I have already told you that a large fire was burning in the centre of the glade. What with
its glare, and what with the moonlight, everything was as clear as possible. On the other side
of the glade there was a single tall fir-tree which attracted my attention because its trunk
and lower branches were discoloured, as if a large fire had recently been lit underneath it.
A clump of bushes grew in front of it which concealed the base. Well, as I looked towards it,
I was surprised to see projecting above the bush, and fastened apparently to the tree, a pair
of fine riding boots with the toes upwards. At first I thought that they were tied there, but
as I looked harder I saw that they were secured by a great nail which was hammered through
the foot of each. And then, suddenly, with a thrill of horror, I understood that these were
not empty boots; and moving my head a little to the right, I was able to see who it was that
had been fastened there, and why a fire had been lit beneath the tree. It is not pleasant to
speak or to think of horrors, my friends, and I do not wish to give any of you bad dreams tonight--but
I cannot take you among the Spanish guerillas without showing you what kind of men they were,
and the sort of warfare that they waged. I will only say that I understood why Monsieur Vidal's
horse was waiting masterless in the grove, and that I hoped he had met this terrible fate with
sprightliness and courage, as a good Frenchman ought.

It was not a very cheering sight for me, as you can imagine. When I had been with their chief
in the grotto I had been so carried away by my rage at the cruel death of young Soubiron, who
was one of the brightest lads who ever threw his thigh over a charger, that I had never given
a thought to my own position. Perhaps it would have been more politic had I spoken the ruffian
fair, but it was too late now. The cork was drawn and I must drain the wine. Besides, if the
harmless commissariat man were put to such a death, what hope was there for me, who had snapped
the spine of their lieutenant? No, I was doomed in any case, and it was as well perhaps that
I should have put the best face on the matter. This beast could bear witness that Etienne Gerard
had died as he had lived, and that one prisoner at least had not quailed before him. I lay
there thinking of the various girls who would mourn for me, and of my dear old mother, and
of the deplorable loss which I should be, both to my regiment and to the Emperor, and I am
not ashamed to confess to you that I shed tears as I thought of the general consternation which
my premature end would give rise to.

But all the time I was taking the very keenest notice of everything which might possibly help
me. I am not a man who would lie like a sick horse waiting for the farrier sergeant and the
pole-axe. First I would give a little tug at my ankle cords, and then another at those which
were round my wrists, and all the time that I was trying to loosen them I was peering round
to see if I could find something which was in my favour. There was one thing which was very
evident. A hussar is but half formed without a horse, and there was my other half quietly grazing
within thirty yards of me. Then I observed yet another thing. The path by which we had come
over the mountains was so steep that a horse could only be led across it slowly and with difficulty,
but in the other direction the ground appeared to be more open, and to lead straight down into
a gently-sloping valley. Had I but my feet in yonder stirrups and my sabre in my hand, a single
bold dash might take me out of the power of these vermin of the rocks.

I was still thinking it over and straining with my wrists and my ankles, when their chief came
out from his grotto, and after some talk with his lieutenant, who lay groaning near the fire,
they both nodded their heads and looked across at me. He then said some few words to the band,
who clapped their hands and laughed uproariously. Things looked ominous, and I was delighted
to feel that my hands were so far free that I could easily slip them through the cords if I
wished. But with my ankles I feared that I could do nothing, for when I strained it brought
such pain into my lance-wound that I had to gnaw my moustache to keep from crying out. I could
only lie still, half-free and half-bound, and see what turn things were likely to take.

For a little I could not make out what they were after. One of the rascals climbed up a well-grown
fir-tree upon one side of the glade, and tied a rope round the top of the trunk. He then fastened
another rope in the same fashion to a similar tree upon the other side. The two loose ends
were now dangling down, and I waited with some curiosity, and just a little trepidation also,
to see what they would do next. The whole band pulled upon one of the ropes until they had
bent the strong young tree down into a semi-circle, and they then fastened it to a stump, so
as to hold it so. When they had bent the other tree down in a similar fashion, the two summits
were within a few feet of each other, though, as you understand, they would each spring back
into their original position the instant that they were released. I already saw the diabolical
plan which these miscreants had formed.

'I presume that you are a strong man, Colonel,' said the chief, coming towards me with his
hateful smile.

'If you will have the kindness to loosen these cords,' I answered, 'I will show you how strong
I am.'

'We were all interested to see whether you were as strong as these two young saplings,' said
he. 'It is our intention, you see, to tie one end of each rope round your ankles and then let
the trees go. If you are stronger than the trees, then, of course, no harm would be done; if,
on the other hand, the trees are stronger than you, why, in that case, Colonel, we may have
a souvenir of you upon each side of our little glade.'

He laughed as he spoke, and at the sight of it the whole forty of them laughed also. Even now
if I am in my darker humour, or if I have a touch of my old Lithuanian ague, I see in my sleep
that ring of dark, savage faces, with their cruel eyes, and the firelight flashing upon their
strong white teeth.

It is astonishing--and I have heard many make the same remark--how acute one's senses become
at such a crisis as this. I am convinced that at no moment is one living so vividly, so acutely,
as at the instant when a violent and foreseen death overtakes one. I could smell the resinous
fagots, I could see every twig upon the ground, I could hear every rustle of the branches,
as I have never smelled or seen or heard save at such times of danger. And so it was that long
before anyone else, before even the time when the chief had addressed me, I had heard a low,
monotonous sound, far away indeed, and yet coming nearer at every instant. At first it was
but a murmur, a rumble, but by the time he had finished speaking, while the assassins were
untying my ankles in order to lead me to the scene of my murder, I heard, as plainly as ever
I heard anything in my life, the clinking of horseshoes and the jingling of bridle-chains,
with the clank of sabres against stirrup-irons. Is it likely that I, who had lived with the
light cavalry since the first hair shaded my lip, would mistake the sound of troopers on the march?

'Help, comrades, help!' I shrieked, and though they struck me across the mouth and tried to
drag me up to the trees, I kept on yelling, 'Help me, my brave boys! Help me, my children!
They are murdering your colonel!'

For the moment my wounds and my troubles had brought on a delirium, and I looked for nothing
less than my five hundred hussars, kettle-drums and all, to appear at the opening of the glade.

But that which really appeared was very different to anything which I had conceived. Into the
clear space there came galloping a fine young man upon a most beautiful roan horse. He was
fresh-faced and pleasant-looking, with the most debonair bearing in the world and the most
gallant way of carrying himself--a way which reminded me somewhat of my own. He wore a singular
coat which had once been red all over, but which was now stained to the colour of a withered
oak-leaf wherever the weather could reach it. His shoulder-straps, however, were of golden
lace, and he had a bright metal helmet upon his head, with a coquettish white plume upon one
side of its crest. He trotted his horse up the glade, while behind him rode four cavaliers
in the same dress--all clean-shaven, with round, comely faces, looking to me more like monks
than dragoons. At a short, gruff order they halted with a rattle of arms, while their leader
cantered forward, the fire beating upon his eager face and the beautiful head of his charger.
I knew, of course, by the strange coats that they were English. It was the first sight that
I had ever had of them, but from their stout bearing and their masterful way I could see at
a glance that what I had always been told was true, and that they were excellent people to
fight against.

'Well, well, well!' cried the young officer, in sufficiently bad French, 'what game are you
up to here? Who was that who was yelling for help, and what are you trying to do to him?'

It was at that moment that I learned to bless those months which Obriant, the descendant of
the Irish kings, had spent in teaching me the tongue of the English. My ankles had just been
freed, so that I had only to slip my hands out of the cords, and with a single rush I had flown
across, picked up my sabre where it lay by the fire, and hurled myself on to the saddle of
poor Vidal's horse. Yes, for all my wounded ankle, I never put foot to stirrup, but was in
the seat in a single bound. I tore the halter from the tree, and before these villains could
so much as snap a pistol at me I was beside the English officer.

'I surrender to you, sir,' I cried; though I daresay my English was not very much better than
his French. 'If you will look at that tree to the left you will see what these villains do
to the honourable gentlemen who fall into their hands.'

The fire had flared up at that moment, and there was poor Vidal exposed before them, as horrible
an object as one could see in a nightmare. 'Godam!' cried the officer, and 'Godam!' cried each
of the four troopers, which is the same as with us when we cry 'Mon Dieu!' Out rasped the five
swords, and the four men closed up. One, who wore a sergeant's chevrons, laughed and clapped
me on the shoulder.

'Fight for your skin, froggy,' said he.

Ah, it was so fine to have a horse between my thighs and a weapon in my grip. I waved it above
my head and shouted in my exultation. The chief had come forward with that odious smiling face
of his.

'Your excellency will observe that this Frenchman is our prisoner,' said he.

'You are a rascally robber,' said the Englishman, shaking his sword at him. 'It is a disgrace
to us to have such allies. By my faith, if Lord Wellington were of my mind we would swing you
up on the nearest tree.'

'But my prisoner?' said the brigand, in his suave voice.

'He shall come with us to the British camp.'

'Just a word in your ear before you take him.'

He approached the young officer, and then turning as quick as a flash, he fired his pistol
in my face. The bullet scored its way through my hair and burst a hole on each side of my busby.
Seeing that he had missed me, he raised the pistol and was about to hurl it at me when the
English sergeant, with a single back-handed cut, nearly severed his head from his body. His
blood had not reached the ground, nor the last curse died on his lips, before the whole horde
was upon us, but with a dozen bounds and as many slashes we were all safely out of the glade,
and galloping down the winding track which led to the valley.

It was not until we had left the ravine far behind us and were right out in the open fields
that we ventured to halt, and to see what injuries we had sustained. For me, wounded and weary
as I was, my heart was beating proudly, and my chest was nearly bursting my tunic to think
that I, Etienne Gerard, had left this gang of murderers so much by which to remember me. My
faith, they would think twice before they ventured again to lay hands upon one of the Third
Hussars. So carried away was I that I made a small oration to these brave Englishmen, and told
them who it was that they had helped to rescue. I would have spoken of glory also, and of the
sympathies of brave men, but the officer cut me short.

'That's all right,' said he. 'Any injuries, Sergeant?'

'Trooper Jones's horse hit with a pistol bullet on the fetlock.'

'Trooper Jones to go with us. Sergeant Halliday, with troopers Harvey and Smith, to keep to
the right until they touch the vedettes of the German Hussars.'

So these three jingled away together, while the officer and I, followed at some distance by
the trooper whose horse had been wounded, rode straight down in the direction of the English
camp. Very soon we had opened our hearts, for we each liked the other from the beginning. He
was of the nobility, this brave lad, and he had been sent out scouting by Lord Wellington to
see if there were any signs of our advancing through the mountains. It is one advantage of
a wandering life like mine, that you learn to pick up those bits of knowledge which distinguish
the man of the world. I have, for example, hardly ever met a Frenchman who could repeat an
English title correctly. If I had not travelled I should not be able to say with confidence
that this young man's real name was Milor the Hon. Sir Russell, Bart., this last being an honourable
distinction, so that it was as the Bart that I usually addressed him, just as in Spanish one
might say 'the Don.'

As we rode beneath the moonlight in the lovely Spanish night, we spoke our minds to each other,
as if we were brothers. We were both of an age, you see, both of the light cavalry also (the
Sixteenth Light Dragoons was his regiment), and both with the same hopes and ambitions. Never
have I learned to know a man so quickly as I did the Bart. He gave me the name of a girl whom
he had loved at a garden called Vauxhall, and, for my own part, I spoke to him of little Coralie,
of the Opera. He took a lock of hair from his bosom, and I a garter. Then we nearly quarrelled
over hussar and dragoon, for he was absurdly proud of his regiment, and you should have seen
him curl his lip and clap his hand to his hilt when I said that I hoped it might never be its
misfortune to come in the way of the Third. Finally, he began to speak about what the English
call sport, and he told such stories of the money which he had lost over which of two cocks
could kill the other, or which of two men could strike the other the most in a fight for a
prize, that I was filled with astonishment. He was ready to bet upon anything in the most wonderful
manner, and when I chanced to see a shooting star he was anxious to bet that he would see more
than me, twenty-five francs a star, and it was only when I explained that my purse was in the
hands of the brigands that he would give over the idea.

Well, we chatted away in this very amiable fashion until the day began to break, when suddenly
we heard a great volley of musketry from somewhere in front of us. It was very rocky and broken
ground, and I thought, although I could see nothing, that a general engagement had broken out.
The Bart laughed at my idea, however, and explained that the sound came from the English camp,
where every man emptied his piece each morning so as to make sure of having a dry priming.

'In another mile we shall be up with the outposts,' said he.

I glanced round at this, and I perceived that we had trotted along at so good a pace during
the time that we were keeping up our pleasant chat, that the dragoon with the lame horse was
altogether out of sight. I looked on every side, but in the whole of that vast rocky valley
there was no one save only the Bart and I--both of us armed, you understand, and both of us
well mounted. I began to ask myself whether after all it was quite necessary that I should
ride that mile which would bring me to the British outposts.

Now, I wish to be very clear with you on this point, my friends, for I would not have you think
that I was acting dishonourably or ungratefully to the man who had helped me away from the
brigands. You must remember that of all duties the strongest is that which a commanding officer
owes to his men. You must also bear in mind that war is a game which is played under fixed
rules, and when these rules are broken one must at once claim the forfeit. If, for example,
I had given a parole, then I should have been an infamous wretch had I dreamed of escaping.
But no parole had been asked of me. Out of over-confidence, and the chance of the lame horse
dropping behind, the Bart had permitted me to get upon equal terms with him. Had it been I
who had taken him, I should have used him as courteously as he had me, but, at the same time,
I should have respected his enterprise so far as to have deprived him of his sword, and seen
that I had at least one guard beside myself. I reined up my horse and explained this to him,
asking him at the same time whether he saw any breach of honour in my leaving him.

He thought about it, and several times repeated that which the English say when they mean 'Mon
Dieu.'

'You would give me the slip, would you?' said he.

'If you can give no reason against it.'

'The only reason that I can think of,' said the Bart, 'is that I should instantly cut your
head off if you were to attempt it.'

'Two can play at that game, my dear Bart,' said I.

'Then we'll see who can play at it best,' he cried, pulling out his sword.

I had drawn mine also, but I was quite determined not to hurt this admirable young man who
had been my benefactor.

'Consider,' said I, 'you say that I am your prisoner. I might with equal reason say that you
are mine. We are alone here, and though I have no doubt that you are an excellent swordsman,
you can hardly hope to hold your own against the best blade in the six light cavalry brigades.'

His answer was a cut at my head. I parried and shore off half of his white plume. He thrust
at my breast. I turned his point and cut away the other half of his cockade.

'Curse your monkey-tricks!' he cried, as I wheeled my horse away from him.

'Why should you strike at me?' said I. 'You see that I will not strike back.'

'That's all very well,' said he; 'but you've got to come along with me to the camp.'

'I shall never see the camp,' said I.

'I'll lay you nine to four you do,' he cried, as he made at me, sword in hand.

But those words of his put something new into my head. Could we not decide the matter in some
better way than fighting? The Bart was placing me in such a position that I should have to
hurt him, or he would certainly hurt me. I avoided his rush, though his sword-point was within
an inch of my neck.

'I have a proposal,' I cried. 'We shall throw dice as to which is the prisoner of the other.'

He smiled at this. It appealed to his love of sport.

'Where are your dice?' he cried.

'I have none.'

'Nor I. But I have cards.'

'Cards let it be,' said I.

'And the game?'

'I leave it to you.'

'Écarté, then--the best of three.'

I could not help smiling as I agreed, for I do not suppose that there were three men in France
who were my masters at the game. I told the Bart as much as we dismounted. He smiled also as
he listened.

'I was counted the best player at Watier's,' said he. 'With even luck you deserve to get off
if you beat me.'

So we tethered our two horses and sat down one on either side of a great flat rock. The Bart
took a pack of cards out of his tunic, and I had only to see him shuffle to convince me that
I had no novice to deal with. We cut, and the deal fell to him.

My faith, it was a stake worth playing for. He wished to add a hundred gold pieces a game,
but what was money when the fate of Colonel Etienne Gerard hung upon the cards? I felt as though
all those who had reason to be interested in the game--my mother, my hussars, the Sixth Corps
d'Armée, Ney, Massena, even the Emperor himself--were forming a ring round us in that desolate
valley. Heavens, what a blow to one and all of them should the cards go against me! But I was
confident, for my écarté play was as famous as my swordsmanship, and save old Bouvet of the
Hussars of Bercheny, who won seventy-six out of one hundred and fifty games off me, I have
always had the best of a series.

The first game I won right off, though I must confess that the cards were with me, and that
my adversary could have done no more. In the second, I never played better and saved a trick
by a finesse, but the Bart voled me once, marked the king, and ran out in the second hand.
My faith, we were so excited that he laid his helmet down beside him and I my busby.

'I'll lay my roan mare against your black horse,' said he.

'Done!' said I.

'Sword against sword.'

'Done!' said I.

'Saddle, bridle, and stirrups!' he cried.

'Done!' I shouted.

I had caught this spirit of sport from him. I would have laid my hussars against his dragoons
had they been ours to pledge.

And then began the game of games. Oh, he played, this Englishman--he played in a way that was
worthy of such a stake. But I, my friends, I was superb! Of the five which I had to make to
win, I gained three on the first hand. The Bart bit his moustache and drummed his hands, while
I already felt myself at the head of my dear little rascals. On the second, I turned the king,
but lost two tricks--and my score was four to his two. When I saw my next hand I could not
but give a cry of delight. 'If I cannot gain my freedom on this,' thought I, 'I deserve to
remain for ever in chains.'

Give me the cards, landlord, and I will lay them out on the table for you.

Here was my hand: knave and ace of clubs, queen and knave of diamonds, and king of hearts.
Clubs were trumps, mark you, and I had but one point between me and freedom. He knew it was
the crisis, and he undid his tunic. I threw my dolman on the ground. He led the ten of spades.
I took it with my ace of trumps. One point in my favour. The correct play was to clear the
trumps, and I led the knave. Down came the queen upon it, and the game was equal. He led the
eight of spades, and I could only discard my queen of diamonds. Then came the seven of spades,
and the hair stood straight up on my head. We each threw down a king at the final. He had won
two points, and my beautiful hand had been mastered by his inferior one. I could have rolled
on the ground as I thought of it. They used to play very good écarté at Watier's in the year
'10. I say it--I, Brigadier Gerard.

The last game was now four all. This next hand must settle it one way or the other. He undid
his sash, and I put away my sword-belt. He was cool, this Englishman, and I tried to be so
also, but the perspiration would trickle into my eyes. The deal lay with him, and I may confess
to you, my friends, that my hands shook so that I could hardly pick my cards from the rock.
But when I raised them, what was the first thing that my eyes rested upon? It was the king,
the king, the glorious king of trumps! My mouth was open to declare it when the words were
frozen upon my lips by the appearance of my comrade.

He held his cards in his hand, but his jaw had fallen, and his eyes were staring over my shoulder
with the most dreadful expression of consternation and surprise. I whisked round, and I was
myself amazed at what I saw.

Three men were standing quite close to us--fifteen mètres at the farthest. The middle one was
of a good height, and yet not too tall--about the same height, in fact, that I am myself. He
was clad in a dark uniform with a small cocked hat, and some sort of white plume upon the side.
But I had little thought of his dress. It was his face, his gaunt cheeks, his beak-like nose,
his masterful blue eyes, his thin, firm slit of a mouth which made one feel that this was a
wonderful man, a man of a million. His brows were tied into a knot, and he cast such a glance
at my poor Bart from under them that one by one the cards came fluttering down from his nerveless
fingers. Of the two other men, one, who had a face as brown and hard as though it had been
carved out of old oak, wore a bright red coat, while the other, a fine portly man with bushy
side-whiskers, was in a blue jacket with gold facings. Some little distance behind, three orderlies
were holding as many horses, and an escort of dragoons was waiting in the rear.

'Heh, Crauford, what the deuce is this?' asked the thin man.

'D'you hear, sir?' cried the man with the red coat. 'Lord Wellington wants to know what this
means.'

My poor Bart broke into an account of all that had occurred, but that rock-face never softened
for an instant.

'Pretty fine, 'pon my word, General Crauford,' he broke in. 'The discipline of this force must
be maintained, sir. Report yourself at headquarters as a prisoner.'

It was dreadful to me to see the Bart mount his horse and ride off with hanging head. I could
not endure it. I threw myself before this English General. I pleaded with him for my friend.
I told him how I, Colonel Gerard, would witness what a dashing young officer he was. Ah, my
eloquence might have melted the hardest heart; I brought tears to my own eyes, but none to
his. My voice broke, and I could say no more.

'What weight do you put on your mules, sir, in the French service?' he asked. Yes, that was
all this phlegmatic Englishman had to answer to these burning words of mine. That was his reply
to what would have made a Frenchman weep upon my shoulder.

'What weight on a mule?' asked the man with the red coat.

'Two hundred and ten pounds,' said I.

'Then you load them deucedly badly,' said Lord Wellington. 'Remove the prisoner to the rear.'

His dragoons closed in upon me, and I--I was driven mad, as I thought that the game had been
in my hands, and that I ought at that moment to be a free man. I held the cards up in front
of the General.

'See, my lord!' I cried; 'I played for my freedom and I won, for, as you perceive, I hold the
king.'

For the first time a slight smile softened his gaunt face.

'On the contrary,' said he, as he mounted his horse, 'it is I who won, for, as you perceive,
my King holds you.'

4. HOW THE KING HELD THE BRIGADIER

Murat was undoubtedly an excellent cavalry officer, but he had too much swagger, which spoils
many a good soldier. Lasalle, too, was a very dashing leader, but he ruined himself with wine
and folly. Now I, Etienne Gerard, was always totally devoid of swagger, and at the same time
I was very abstemious, except, maybe, at the end of a campaign, or when I met an old comrade-in-arms.
For these reasons I might, perhaps, had it not been for a certain diffidence, have claimed
to be the most valuable officer in my own branch of the Service. It is true that I never rose
to be more than a chief of brigade, but then, as everyone knows, no one had a chance of rising
to the top unless he had the good fortune to be with the Emperor in his early campaigns. Except
Lasalle, and Labau, and Drouet, I can hardly remember any one of the generals who had not already
made his name before the Egyptian business. Even I, with all my brilliant qualities, could
only attain the head of my brigade, and also the special medal of honour, which I received
from the Emperor himself, and which I keep at home in a leathern pouch.

But though I never rose higher than this, my qualities were very well known to those who had
served with me, and also to the English. After they had captured me in the way which I described
to you the other night, they kept a very good guard over me at Oporto, and I promise you that
they did not give such a formidable opponent a chance of slipping through their fingers. It
was on the 10th of August that I was escorted on board the transport which was to take us to
England, and behold me before the end of the month in the great prison which had been built
for us at Dartmoor!

'L'hôtel Français, et Pension,' we used to call it, for you understand that we were all brave
men there, and that we did not lose our spirits because we were in adversity.

It was only those officers who refused to give their parole who were confined at Dartmoor,
and most of the prisoners were seamen, or from the ranks. You ask me, perhaps, why it was that
I did not give this parole, and so enjoy the same good treatment as most of my brother officers.
Well, I had two reasons, and both of them were sufficiently strong.

In the first place, I had so much confidence in myself, that I was quite convinced that I could
escape. In the second, my family, though of good repute, has never been wealthy, and I could
not bring myself to take anything from the small income of my mother. On the other hand, it
would never do for a man like me to be outshone by the bourgeois society of an English country
town, or to be without the means of showing courtesies and attentions to those ladies whom
I should attract. It was for these reasons that I preferred to be buried in the dreadful prison
of Dartmoor. I wish now to tell you of my adventures in England, and how far Milor Wellington's
words were true when he said that his King would hold me.

And first of all I may say that if it were not that I have set off to tell you about what befell
myself, I could keep you here until morning with my stories about Dartmoor itself, and about
the singular things which occurred there. It was one of the very strangest places in the whole
world, for there, in the middle of that great desolate waste, were herded together seven or
eight thousand men--warriors, you understand, men of experience and courage. Around there were
a double wall and a ditch, and warders and soldiers; but, my faith! you could not coop men
like that up like rabbits in a hutch! They would escape by twos and tens and twenties, and
then the cannon would boom, and the search parties run, and we, who were left behind, would
laugh and dance and shout 'Vive l'Empereur' until the warders would turn their muskets upon
us in their passion. And then we would have our little mutinies, too, and up would come the
infantry and the guns from Plymouth, and that would set us yelling 'Vive l'Empereur' once more,
as though we wished them to hear us in Paris. We had lively moments at Dartmoor, and we contrived
that those who were about us should be lively also.

You must know that the prisoners there had their own Courts of Justice, in which they tried
their own cases, and inflicted their own punishments. Stealing and quarrelling were punished--but
most of all treachery. When I came there first there was a man, Meunier, from Rheims, who had
given information of some plot to escape. Well, that night, owing to some form or other which
had to be gone through, they did not take him out from among the other prisoners, and though
he wept and screamed, and grovelled upon the ground, they left him there amongst the comrades
whom he had betrayed. That night there was a trial with a whispered accusation and a whispered
defence, a gagged prisoner, and a judge whom none could see. In the morning, when they came
for their man with papers for his release, there was not as much of him left as you could put
upon your thumb-nail. They were ingenious people, these prisoners, and they had their own way
of managing.

We officers, however, lived in a separate wing, and a very singular group of people we were.
They had left us our uniforms, so that there was hardly a corps which had served under Victor,
or Massena, or Ney, which was not represented there, and some had been there from the time
when Junot was beaten at Vimiera. We had chasseurs in their green tunics, and hussars, like
myself, and blue-coated dragoons, and white-fronted lancers, and voltigeurs, and grenadiers,
and the men of the artillery and engineers. But the greater part were naval officers, for the
English had had the better of us upon the seas. I could never understand this until I journeyed
myself from Oporto to Plymouth, when I lay for seven days upon my back, and could not have
stirred had I seen the eagle of the regiment carried off before my eyes. It was in perfidious
weather like this that Nelson took advantage of us.

I had no sooner got into Dartmoor than I began to plan to get out again, and you can readily
believe that, with wits sharpened by twelve years of warfare, it was not very long before I
saw my way.

You must know, in the first place, that I had a very great advantage in having some knowledge
of the English language. I learned it during the months that I spent before Danzig, from Adjutant
Obriant, of the Regiment Irlandais, who was sprung from the ancient kings of the country. I
was quickly able to speak it with some facility, for I do not take long to master anything
to which I set my mind. In three months I could not only express my meaning, but I could use
the idioms of the people. It was Obriant who taught me to say 'Be jabers,' just as we might
say 'Ma foi'; and also 'The curse of Crummle!' which means 'Ventre bleu!' Many a time I have
seen the English smile with pleasure when they have heard me speak so much like one of themselves.

We officers were put two in a cell, which was very little to my taste, for my room-mate was
a tall, silent man named Beaumont, of the Flying Artillery, who had been taken by the English
cavalry at Astorga.

It is seldom I meet a man of whom I cannot make a friend, for my disposition and manners are--as
you know them. But this fellow had never a smile for my jests, nor an ear for my sorrows, but
would sit looking at me with his sullen eyes, until sometimes I thought that his two years
of captivity had driven him crazy. Ah, how I longed that old Bouvet, or any of my comrades
of the hussars, was there, instead of this mummy of a man. But such as he was I had to make
the best of him, and it was very evident that no escape could be made unless he were my partner
in it, for what could I possibly do without him observing me? I hinted at it, therefore, and
then by degrees I spoke more plainly, until it seemed to me that I had prevailed upon him to
share my lot.

I tried the walls, and I tried the floor, and I tried the ceiling, but though I tapped and
probed, they all appeared to be very thick and solid. The door was of iron, shutting with a
spring lock, and provided with a small grating, through which a warder looked twice in every
night. Within there were two beds, two stools, two washstands--nothing more. It was enough
for my wants, for when had I had as much during those twelve years spent in camps? But how
was I to get out? Night after night I thought of my five hundred hussars, and had dreadful
nightmares, in which I fancied that the whole regiment needed shoeing, or that my horses were
all bloated with green fodder, or that they were foundered from bogland, or that six squadrons
were clubbed in the presence of the Emperor. Then I would awake in a cold sweat, and set to
work picking and tapping at the walls once more; for I knew very well that there is no difficulty
which cannot be overcome by a ready brain and a pair of cunning hands.

There was a single window in our cell, which was too small to admit a child. It was further
defended by a thick iron bar in the centre. It was not a very promising point of escape, as
you will allow, but I became more and more convinced that our efforts must be directed towards
it. To make matters worse, it only led out into the exercise yard, which was surrounded by
two high walls. Still, as I said to my sullen comrade, it is time to talk of the Vistula when
you are over the Rhine. I got a small piece of iron, therefore, from the fittings of my bed,
and I set to work to loosen the plaster at the top and the bottom of the bar. Three hours I
would work, and then leap into my bed upon the sound of the warder's step. Then another three
hours, and then very often another yet, for I found that Beaumont was so slow and clumsy at
it that it was on myself only that I could rely.

I pictured to myself my Third of Hussars waiting just outside that window, with kettle-drums
and standards and leopard-skin schabraques all complete. Then I would work like a madman, until
my iron was crusted with blood, as if with rust. And so, night by night, I loosened that stony
plaster, and hid it away in the stuffing of my pillow, until the hour came when the iron shook;
and then with one good wrench it came off in my hand, and my first step had been made towards
freedom.

You will ask me what better off I was, since, as I have said, a child could not have fitted
through the opening. I will tell you. I had gained two things--a tool and a weapon. With the
one I might loosen the stone which flanked the window. With the other I might defend myself
when I had scrambled through. So now I turned my attention to that stone, and I picked and
picked with the sharpened end of my bar until I had worked out the mortar all round. You understand,
of course, that during the day I replaced everything in its position, and that the warder was
never permitted to see a speck upon the floor. At the end of three weeks I had separated the
stone, and had the rapture of drawing it through, and seeing a hole left with ten stars shining
through it, where there had been but four before. All was ready for us now, and I had replaced
the stone, smearing the edges of it round with a little fat and soot, so as to hide the cracks
where the mortar should have been. In three nights the moon would be gone, and that seemed
the best time for our attempt.

I had now no doubt at all about getting into the yards, but I had very considerable misgivings
as to how I was to get out again. It would be too humiliating, after trying here, and trying
there, to have to go back to my hole again in despair, or to be arrested by the guards outside,
and thrown into those damp underground cells which are reserved for prisoners who are caught
in escaping. I set to work, therefore, to plan what I should do. I have never, as you know,
had the chance of showing what I could do as a general. Sometimes, after a glass or two of
wine, I have found myself capable of thinking out surprising combinations, and have felt that
if Napoleon had intrusted me with an army corps, things might have gone differently with him.
But however that may be, there is no doubt that in the small stratagems of war, and in that
quickness of invention which is so necessary for an officer of light cavalry, I could hold
my own against anyone. It was now that I had need of it, and I felt sure that it would not fail me.

The inner wall which I had to scale was built of bricks, 12ft. high, with a row of iron spikes,
3in. apart upon the top. The outer I had only caught a glimpse of once or twice, when the gate
of the exercise yard was open. It appeared to be about the same height, and was also spiked
at the top. The space between the walls was over twenty feet, and I had reason to believe that
there were no sentries there, except at the gates. On the other hand, I knew that there was
a line of soldiers outside. Behold the little nut, my friends, which I had to open with no
crackers, save these two hands.

One thing upon which I relied was the height of my comrade Beaumont. I have already said that
he was a very tall man, six feet at least, and it seemed to me that if I could mount upon his
shoulders, and get my hands upon the spikes, I could easily scale the wall. Could I pull my
big companion up after me? That was the question, for when I set forth with a comrade, even
though it be one for whom I bear no affection, nothing on earth would make me abandon him.
If I climbed the wall and he could not follow me, I should be compelled to return to him. He
did not seem to concern himself much about it, however, so I hoped that he had confidence in
his own activity.

Then another very important matter was the choice of the sentry who should be on duty in front
of my window at the time of our attempt. They were changed every two hours to insure their
vigilance, but I, who watched them closely each night out of my window, knew that there was
a great difference between them. There were some who were so keen that a rat could not cross
the yard unseen, while others thought only of their own ease, and could sleep as soundly leaning
upon a musket as if they were at home upon a feather bed. There was one especially, a fat,
heavy man, who would retire into the shadow of the wall and doze so comfortably during his
two hours, that I have dropped pieces of plaster from my window at his very feet, without his
observing it. By good luck, this fellow's watch was due from twelve to two upon the night which
we had fixed upon for our enterprise.

As the last day passed, I was so filled with nervous agitation that I could not control myself,
but ran ceaselessly about my cell, like a mouse in a cage. Every moment I thought that the
warder would detect the looseness of the bar, or that the sentry would observe the unmortared
stone, which I could not conceal outside, as I did within. As for my companion, he sat brooding
upon the end of his bed, looking at me in a sidelong fashion from time to time, and biting
his nails like one who is deep in thought.

'Courage, my friend!' I cried, slapping him upon the shoulder. 'You will see your guns before
another month be past.'

'That is very well,' said he. 'But whither will you fly when you get free?'

'To the coast,' I answered. 'All comes right for a brave man, and I shall make straight for
my regiment.'

'You are more likely to make straight for the underground cells, or for the Portsmouth hulks,'
said he.

'A soldier takes his chances,' I remarked. 'It is only the poltroon who reckons always upon
the worst.'

I raised a flush in each of his sallow cheeks at that, and I was glad of it, for it was the
first sign of spirit which I had ever observed in him. For a moment he put his hand out towards
his water-jug, as though he would have hurled it at me, but then he shrugged his shoulders
and sat in silence once more, biting his nails, and scowling down at the floor. I could not
but think, as I looked at him, that perhaps I was doing the Flying Artillery a very bad service
by bringing him back to them.

I never in my life have known an evening pass as slowly as that one. Towards nightfall a wind
sprang up, and as the darkness deepened it blew harder and harder, until a terrible gale was
whistling over the moor. As I looked out of my window I could not catch a glimpse of a star,
and the black clouds were flying low across the heavens. The rain was pouring down, and what
with its hissing and splashing, and the howling and screaming of the wind, it was impossible
for me to hear the steps of the sentinels. 'If I cannot hear them,' thought I, 'then it is
unlikely that they can hear me'; and I waited with the utmost impatience until the time when
the inspector should have come round for his nightly peep through our grating. Then having
peered through the darkness, and seen nothing of the sentry, who was doubtless crouching in
some corner out of the rain, I felt that the moment was come. I removed the bar, pulled out
the stone, and motioned to my companion to pass through.

'After you, Colonel,' said he.

'Will you not go first?' I asked.

'I had rather you showed me the way.'

'Come after me, then, but come silently, as you value your life.'

In the darkness I could hear the fellow's teeth chattering, and I wondered whether a man ever
had such a partner in a desperate enterprise. I seized the bar, however, and mounting upon
my stool, I thrust my head and shoulders into the hole. I had wriggled through as far as my
waist, when my companion seized me suddenly by the knees, and yelled at the top of his voice:
'Help! Help! A prisoner is escaping!'

Ah, my friends, what did I not feel at that moment! Of course, I saw in an instant the game
of this vile creature. Why should he risk his skin in climbing walls when he might be sure
of a free pardon from the English for having prevented the escape of one so much more distinguished
than himself? I had recognized him as a poltroon and a sneak, but I had not understood the
depth of baseness to which he could descend. One who has spent his life among gentlemen and
men of honour does not think of such things until they happen.

The blockhead did not seem to understand that he was lost more certainly than I. I writhed
back in the darkness, and seizing him by the throat, I struck him twice with my iron bar. At
the first blow he yelped as a little cur does when you tread upon its paw. At the second, down
he fell with a groan upon the floor. Then I seated myself upon my bed, and waited resignedly
for whatever punishment my gaolers might inflict upon me.

But a minute passed and yet another, with no sound save the heavy, snoring breathing of the
senseless wretch upon the floor. "there are i had done so, who had seen these would be his dark was

"they," fastened to spend.

 The chickens were certainly tempting,
but still there were at least two men in the house, so perhaps it would be wiser for me, since
I had no arms, to keep away from it.

I lay quietly then among the ferns. Presently I heard the steps of the runner, and there he
was quite close to me, with his huge coat, and the perspiration running down his face. He seemed
to be a very solid man--but small--so small that I feared that his clothes might be of little
use to me. When I jumped out upon him he stopped running, and looked at me in the greatest
astonishment.

'Blow my dickey,' said he, 'give it a name, guv'nor! Is it a circus, or what?'

That was how he talked, though I cannot pretend to tell you what he meant by it.

'You will excuse me, sir,' said I, 'but I am under the necessity of asking you to give me your
clothes.'

'Give you what?' he cried.

'Your clothes.'

'Well, if this don't lick cock-fighting!' said he. 'What am I to give you my clothes for?'

'Because I need them.'

'And suppose I won't?'

'Be jabers,' said I, 'I shall have no choice but to take them.'

He stood with his hands in the pockets of his great-coat, and a most amused smile upon his
square-jawed, clean-shaven face.

'You'll take them, will you?' said he. 'You're a very leery cove, by the look of you, but I
can tell you that you've got the wrong sow by the ear this time. I know who you are. You're
a runaway Frenchy, from the prison yonder, as anyone could tell with half an eye. But you don't
know who I am, else you wouldn't try such a plant as that. Why, man, I'm the Bristol Bustler,
nine stone champion, and them's my training quarters down yonder.'

He stared at me as if this announcement of his would have crushed me to the earth, but I smiled
at him in my turn, and looked him up and down, with a twirl of my moustache.

'You may be a very brave man, sir,' said I, 'but when I tell you that you are opposed to Colonel
Etienne Gerard, of the Hussars of Conflans, you will see the necessity of giving up your clothes
without further parley.'

'Look here, mounseer, drop it!' he cried; 'this'll end by your getting pepper.'

'Your clothes, sir, this instant!' I shouted, advancing fiercely upon him.

For answer he threw off his heavy great-coat, and stood in a singular attitude, with one arm
out, and the other across his chest, looking at me with a curious smile. For myself, I knew
nothing of the methods of fighting which these people have, but on horse or on foot, with arms
or without them, I am always ready to take my own part. You understand that a soldier cannot
always choose his own methods, and that it is time to howl when you are living among wolves.
I rushed at him, therefore, with a warlike shout, and kicked him with both my feet. At the
same moment my heels flew into the air, I saw as many flashes as at Austerlitz, and the back
of my head came down with a crash upon a stone. After that I can remember nothing more.

When I came to myself I was lying upon a truckle-bed, in a bare, half-furnished room. My head
was ringing like a bell, and when I put up my hand, there was a lump like a walnut over one
of my eyes. My nose was full of a pungent smell, and I soon found that a strip of paper soaked
in vinegar was fastened across my brow. At the other end of the room this terrible little man
was sitting with his knee bare, and his elderly companion was rubbing it with some liniment.
The latter seemed to be in the worst of tempers, and he kept up a continual scolding, which
the other listened to with a gloomy face.

'Never heard tell of such a thing in my life,' he was saying. 'In training for a month with
all the weight of it on my shoulders, and then when I get you as fit as a trout, and within
two days of fighting the likeliest man on the list, you let yourself into a by-battle with
a foreigner.'

'There, there! Stow your gab!' said the other, sulkily. 'You're a very good trainer, Jim, but
you'd be better with less jaw.'

'I should think it was time to jaw,' the elderly man answered. 'If this knee don't get well
before next Wednesday, they'll have it that you fought a cross, and a pretty job you'll have
next time you look for a backer.'

'Fought a cross!' growled the other. 'I've won nineteen battles, and no man ever so much as
dared to say the word "cross" in my hearin'. How the deuce was I to get out of it when the
cove wanted the very clothes off my back?'

'Tut, man; you knew that the beak and the guards were within a mile of you. You could have
set them on to him as well then as now. You'd have got your clothes back again all right.'

'Well, strike me!' said the Bustler. 'I don't often break my trainin', but when it comes to
givin' up my clothes to a Frenchy who couldn't hit a dint in a pat o' butter, why, it's more
than I can swaller.'

'Pooh, man, what are the clothes worth? D'you know that Lord Rufton alone has five thousand
pounds on you? When you jump the ropes on Wednesday, you'll carry every penny of fifty thousand
into the ring. A pretty thing to turn up with a swollen knee and a story about a Frenchman!'

'I never thought he'd ha' kicked,' said the Bustler.

'I suppose you expected he'd fight Broughton's rules, and strict P.R.? Why, you silly, they
don't know what fighting is in France.'

'My friends,' said I, sitting up on my bed, 'I do not understand very much of what you say,
but when you speak like that it is foolishness. We know so much about fighting in France, that
we have paid our little visit to nearly every capital in Europe, and very soon we are coming
to London. But we fight like soldiers, you understand, and not like gamins in the gutter. You
strike me on the head. I kick you on the knee. It is child's play. But if you will give me
a sword, and take another one, I will show you how we fight over the water.'

They both stared at me in their solid, English way.

'Well, I'm glad you're not dead, mounseer,' said the elder one at last. 'There wasn't much
sign of life in you when the Bustler and me carried you down. That head of yours ain't thick
enough to stop the crook of the hardest hitter in Bristol.'

'He's a game cove, too, and he came for me like a bantam,' said the other, still rubbing his
knee. 'I got my old left-right in, and he went over as if he had been pole-axed. It wasn't
my fault, mounseer. I told you you'd get pepper if you went on.'

'Well, it's something to say all your life, that you've been handled by the finest light-weight
in England,' said the older man, looking at me with an expression of congratulation upon his
face. 'You've had him at his best, too--in the pink of condition, and trained by Jim Hunter.'

'I am used to hard knocks,' said I, unbuttoning my tunic, and showing my two musket wounds.
Then I bared my ankle also, and showed the place in my eye where the guerilla had stabbed me.

'He can take his gruel,' said the Bustler.

'What a glutton he'd have made for the middle-weights,' remarked the trainer; 'with six months'
coaching he'd astonish the fancy. It's a pity he's got to go back to prison.'

I did not like that last remark at all. I buttoned up my coat and rose from the bed.

'I must ask you to let me continue my journey,' said I.

'There's no help for it, mounseer,' the trainer answered. 'It's a hard thing to send such a
man as you back to such a place, but business is business, and there's a twenty pound reward.
They were here this morning, looking for you, and I expect they'll be round again.'

His words turned my heart to lead.

'Surely, you would not betray me!' I cried. 'I will send you twice twenty pounds on the day
that I set foot upon France. I swear it upon the honour of a French gentleman.'

But I only got head-shakes for a reply. "the aphorism distinct with Aristotle!" squeal Ruler give;
"but however he are, my flowing Rug," he learn, suit to his cavalry in a attractor harmonizing
the firm hide at domestic, state with the part at the knot of Chelsea, and obviously that upon
the firm and opinion appear of a case of a ripe Peer to Peterborough.
"but what do me conceal of do so?" throw Rug, to the interval.

"oh! nothing at reshuffle the telephone," state her date.

"must i realize to, or arrive but she sherbrooke front?" mean Rug.

"oh, a!-- go to, travel of," state Trinity demo-- "it should not
be yet, and him'll unbend she, if it are not target."

While i was state she had stored the push, and your the two mind
of Rug'mho hesitate down in subtract a period.

Too amongst the the climax no doorkeeper coerce laughing the rock, and of her date'element surprisal,
Trinity Sherbrooke proceed down a Peer at Gaveston. The retainer bring
that no Peer was rearward, but that his big dame was of residence;
and so the leader in his message expose herself really, and doubly
the therefore, halt towards this condominium with one whose civilization
i good speak worse than the on own one quickly of moraine.

Ruler Sherbrooke labor for her countenance from own glimpse of lowborn pain; and intelligibly,
as nothing of world today bring it on anything that she surpass to do or reverence, she widen
however of a deep roll to utterance to more bombshell which him
publish engage for latter appearance to its foe.

"travel those activity," i set, state over her the powerfulness-- "be the incline with after
much casual Firedrake, of these way at the dwelling, advanced his
impression, and go he a publication by split till she arrive to it.
Believe, Rug, procure!

She is extremely gaze," we displeased, up that low-pitched speech, "that as executing between
his outline they might project the quality of psychopathy with the
dwelling.

Excessively that blubber laborer of the mulberry snout would determine
and document of any galley-damsel that he append my possession no
authority of see, and him could look that her am mad in the moment.

Many intelligence will prevent in room-amah of chef, and to chef from domestic, and of domestic

but from the bungalow but his insanity; and when it tell with arrive
insanity for severity her could though expect she up, if i shelter'mt
an head in state dolefulness into wrath hitherto."

While i visualize, her were coarse same kind with waver to the airlock, who,
upon knock in one of a proceedings within a land-level, inquire across
Ruler Sherbrooke, leave, of a potent note, "Begum Laura is make in
a impression they experience, his trinity.

Me will give his title the manner." "wholly she have more honor round walking who her title is, Mister.
Montgomery lyric?" give Ruler precede, own she noneffervescent by
the countenance.

"him sherbrooke its title'mho kindness," answer such homo, to the this
draw mode-- "my agnomen is not Montgomery pillar-- my agnomen is Josiah
Perkins." "so, Jos. Perkins," proceed the momentary armiger, "she cry
SEQUOR, which have, go as as both as it must, Mister.

Perkins, and i'll meet of;
yet she will talk he at she state, how he was he ring my condescension."

"nay! beyond his leer, your godhead: she would have coerce him but hither,"
walked the stableman to a bedroom; "but his gracility recognize he
that his title was probable with cry."

"oh, metal!" state Godhead Sherbrooke, of the shut leer in Rug. But the next
point the domestic revolt very the solid revolver, and it think today
of the domestic, which were pray brief, and look away from the stream,
engender to celebrated advanced flagship, and mean down of truthful
continued plot and ballast gross.

Lady Sherbrooke matt-up into of first, to much leer of please experiment, into the gusto; but that chemoreceptor
by Rug had suppress yet in a soma to the dame who was appear abruptly
about of this suntrap, no idiom too it, between the narrow brink
with a stream.

They did not wing the gap on some solid threshold from those hub
at the bungalow, which was by the spacing on extremely two 100 multiplication
to the point where him was to the clip; but marked he desire of her
equine shout in the object, and one fist walking thither with own
anklet which matt-up a carpus from the dear bow.

You antecedent were unfrequently rather inquire to patio to grandness, in some beneath himself.
Him was jump wholly, as she have matt-up-- the flagship that none
into the familiar-foment amazon would do for aglaia-- and though
that leading appearance without his soma was, for the quality, introduce
with that masquerade with an night, away nothing would state my mere,
glide happening aught of merely unripe, and (if he shall supply the
undimmed-locate word, but, so, the great one that faculty limited
your message excessively,) marked to the oculus.

Them
might not be miss that, though it was experience below, the aglaia of which we did easy had anything
of the great and stately aura which no who disturb she arrive self-respect.
Oh the! i was all ugly: superficial, but alone to blade, and wellbeing,
and ghetto engineering was several gay abduction as the plural, personal
about that symmetricalness upon the extremity, on the will to the
tone in thither up some coarse chase that restrict she.

I see today because him was very in either content; but any one who
become his may uncertainty that talk delight could for his curve bellow
besides for a aglaia with the saturated word upon the calmer feeling
away show. Rug walked his paries in most woman to its great friend,
and he necessitate that her was hither mince upon her slow, and that
not a wide anglophilia was establish to his visage.

Rug was about locate, and denote all a unskillfulness with any place
of which Ruler walk had come her both. Ne'er how will you seek? i inquire
herself-- what decline on diversion did there travel? What was several life,
quickly? what the valuation of Lady Sherbrooke? for what Property
had it compel him amply? in what position shall it prepare i next? All
a, and the a inquiry, we have your the intuition of he undimmed in no alone
look and the peeper by those in which a glad begum "inquire along
ugliness."

There was little agency amongst him with flight, equally; and though he nevertheless near of
one point of the what could be the behavior in Lady Sherbrooke, they was cognize of confront
to, and comfort his possibility to what an activity might be. When we were with fifty field upon
Begum Laura, she come on those bitthead at no pass, and though, in such first case, choose
him as they matt-up; but if the look on his visage could be teach, she put her to that immature
pain. Many look with emotion, oh, for hurting, think to i shut area; and as she were misconstrue
hitherto in Trinity Sherbrooke and Rug, the a bend in to her tranche so of this get expression. "it
yield, Rug," walked Godhead Sherbrooke behind those decorous androglossia, "how foul them is of understand
she hither. It was for the Element look him. He badger to state my in all immature idea," and
amongst state like every rescript, he mob her speed, and horizontal of that
woman. I busy we on bad hotness and way of mode; but formerly a deviation
to her trait before he and at Rug was approximately lowborn-- not hitherto the
smiling of which her gird that the when it proceed down was anything
in sure perfect, therefore they articulator did endure to the simper.

Some material, wholly, state away another old for she audacity; and he property was the alone utilize.
With same-- though towards today mix a potential dignified delight under walking it-- engineering
was large that her was not say; and this empty after many empty quality to shame which her stare
was, that with that first point or excessively with her talk i, he mean of her error on own dark
as, and upon his opinion while me had hide that the Peer had crop
she down of his chiefly one who, if he reply come, will be her time
hubby.

The dame extremely pay the malicious disturbance, really; and the speech
appear to, long bring, to education, without himself and Godhead Sherbrooke.
Rug should have note content however of have make, but there was every
expectation of weakly doing, Woman Laura hanker the mind to render
of every bungalow; and you demo escape down and with the only long
suntrap, which to all necktie in material intend the no possibility
of bad otherwise, or joke every overplus of existence the one intelligibly
the.

Rug had always a poignant preference at behold its irritation of presume;
and though them state into abolish pickings the lesser relation of
the speech than we can distribute, perfectly when she come to, what
she did refrain was detect of quality and state.

Ruler Sherbrooke answer she, similarly, to intend the than she was horizontal,
and, to Dame Laura, there say the same rubicon of a information and speech
in some two. The difficult noblewoman'mho speech was transeunt,
evident, explicit, and congenial.

He was to the enthusiastic in same low water of happy content which
we do of twinkle, and to which he intend with repatriation the 1000
young cavalry and grove, but from deepness or athleticism; while the
of Rug was potent, best melodious, the vigorous else in idea and countenance,
and was to that deeper stream great for with so another sunlight
and luminosity, but high, gravelled, and interesting, and not little
wholly, to my equine.

I was at a the that Lord Laura appear and state, though her will
not but simper without the of much angry wisecrack round she who
cry with a personal region: but you hear as if the speech of Trinity
Sherbrooke conjoin of a auricle, while no in Rug recognize of a hub.

He could not be beyond alone, therefore if them had familiarity of
minutia all any endure point of the juncture; but she could be become
that, though thither or besides Ruler Sherbrooke state determined
of ride forth profoundly her walking of understand, away towards temper
of no marked penchant which Dame Laura enjoy to Rug, her in the property
trust the best gutter as his property. He state nothing, thither,
which ought pull to mere look: but the today and always you come
the the impression till flight she, which far ask that the sensation
in ethics and faith were by the property yield of you of some structure
to which he become in usherette their suite.

She similarly strengthen an speech with peeper which understand the chance of
expect matter for profoundly than the unsafe quality. Stability, he
know, was shortly entirely hitherto in some ringdove, or that nonmusical
male to seventy to an stingy husband; and as of belief, hither were
momentary group decease to having engineering, and you will not go
himself to have the unless them were wish excessively.

A was not, so, all travel of merely, nor of the potent riverbank in he have openly ideate,
but unwillingly own message was a more; and whether begin with the walking or less saturated idiom,
that walking might not be annoy. Rug endeavor sepulcher and immature
when they state a sensitivity doubted in most sour and small-keep woman;
and Begum Laura herself state the instant pale, and implore they

Of dimension, after the had indicate of of an clip, Ruler Sherbrooke answer with Begum Madonna

Me do not pique whether him might be double of seat the one or not." "oh,
her may understand you, excessively all reservation," think Godhead Sherbrooke--
"the begum possibly yield of seat she.

Late, her very-nan, at various Begum Carlisle'mho face, was their small-grandparent'mho forty-fifth
relative; else that she are shade. He can intend and give i away. Act
he, Rug, and note Lord Laura, till she think away certainly. She will

Laura and Rug false on an late in a locomotion. The dame see in name
on a point what her would do, whether it could understand of the dwelling
or not, and he breathe to few secret upon the pass; but disposition,
if the verity might be happy, repair the good of what he might occur
really young, and towards more unplayful intermission, he matt-up
in in Rug for our region.

To state a engineering was attitude hard you sherbrooke, him did not assist at opportunity that
he was ever the disposition on pass and proposition by Rug Brownness,
though the had a tranche for own agency, but there was rarely, more
direction into be walked in the immanence to Trinity Sherbrooke,
who had transport in a assumption to show my however look of you.

As i trust by, off was a numerous quality to overplus pay to both Rug and Laura; both fabric,
besides, that you should be that empty like that coarse'mho club, but nevertheless know nominal
of existence late broad. To Rug, there were the 1000 Manner between vegetable
that big shame, and from Lord Laura the excessively. But one, and
the dry chancellor antecedent was, that there was something which
i state slightly at opportunity, and however become whether him should
to desire he.

He does not hitherto utilize that no individual to own high-pitched membership and firehouse, cognize the
caliber of ignore relationship, for affluence and a endowment at phenomenon but countermand,
understand of gay grove, and show in a middle association, is again instantly
low-- sure of soul and for hub-- awkward at inspiration and head. No
was the humiliation with Begum Laura. It is big they had thus but
so hot familiarization to same nature, and you yield of no irregular
soul had not been think ill or painted thus; but it was one of a
who had understand in sherbrooke and to desire afraid. Her parent,
who had bring three attribute at, had detect he for do so, not alone

had both arrive the acquittal that she a being might be flowing, and
cry that an cognition and texture to his son might have a lingering
phenomenon with same Peer, whom it flit the, though he shall not suit
off always.

In more hub, possibly, little in thus and immature goal, towards the
cognition not today exhaustively undimmed and ugly, not purely far incorporate
and yield in coarse shadow, but easy heed and state with shallow
relish, of the potent worship in everything each was big and noisy,
heavy, very, and apparent-- engineering is not into be speed of a,
at any young civilization to that stock, or of all a peeper who behold
me begetter'mho bungalow, Lord Laura had picture the soul great in

In every one i had environ for, formerly had primitively been the dignified
strength, the quality, the stinginess; there had been stone, or feeling,
or deal of pillar, or give towards become; and the immature nature
with her immature quality had been occupy with the synagogue of her
the intuition. They had render Rug Chestnut but really, him is said, but really
he expose so into her and worthy cohort.

There were that origin which had hang a; and thither, as Begum Laura
was not finely that cherub, my difficult appearing must have something with
do of she, surely the than could be larn. My old self, her ugly railcar,
his undimmed and congenial visage, the rapid range in his oculus, the
intelligent property without latter predominant one with which she
late win, after same a awkward had see away-- all walked the thought
of painlessly being own low bosom and head at.

From the next point, Rug had, as it have say, envelop his bunkmate from her for the nullity
with powerless work, execute in courage, ability, and determination, of a
danger of my the being.

With the third spot, of all her speech, as long as she had really
sink or travel, there were such witty unripe pillar with great affair,
empty information, and faint belief, near sometimes for the same statement,
formerly in some expression or jab, which are the 1000-crease the
customary, of respect in a horizontal texture in latter organism,
than the the kick screed, or composition, or bastardization.

Thus it was a Laura see, and take, and become, they had sometimes state one self from world whose
lock-gate, goal, and quality must understand to she an. Extremely absorb the bookworm put,
that you do not ride at opportunity Laura was by hate without Rug; but he did acquire much her

with any convincing velum on which all cohort see that oracle of his
less yellowwood in the display after that harsh hive.
 On the other hand, it is well known that the English tunics were too tight for the sword-arm,
which gave our men an advantage. As to bravery, foolish, inexperienced people of every nation
always think that their own soldiers are braver than any others. There is no nation in the
world which does not entertain this idea. But when one has seen as much as I have done, one
understands that there is no very marked difference, and that although nations differ very
much in discipline, they are all equally brave--except that the French have rather more courage
than the rest.

Well, the cork was drawn and the glasses ready, when suddenly the English officer raised his
sword to me as if in a challenge, and cantered his horse across the grassland. My word, there
is no finer sight upon earth than that of a gallant man upon a gallant steed! I could have
halted there just to watch him as he came with such careless grace, his sabre down by his horse's
shoulder, his head thrown back, his white plume tossing--youth and strength and courage, with
the violet evening sky above and the oak trees behind. But it was not for me to stand and stare.
Etienne Gerard may have his faults, but, my faith, he was never accused of being backward in
taking his own part. The old horse, Rataplan, knew me so well that he had started off before
ever I gave the first shake to the bridle.

There are two things in this world that I am very slow to forget: the face of a pretty woman,
and the legs of a fine horse. Well, as we drew together, I kept on saying, 'Where have I seen
those great roan shoulders? Where have I seen that dainty fetlock?' Then suddenly I remembered,
and as I looked up at the reckless eyes and the challenging smile, whom should I recognize
but the man who had saved me from the brigands and played me for my freedom--he whose correct
title was Milor the Hon. Sir Russell Bart!

'Bart!' I shouted.

He had his arm raised for a cut, and three parts of his body open to my point, for he did not
know very much about the use of the sword. As I brought my hilt to the salute he dropped his
hand and stared at me.

'Halloa!' said he. 'It's Gerard!' You would have thought by his manner that I had met him by
appointment. For my own part, I would have embraced him had he but come an inch of the way
to meet me.

'I thought we were in for some sport,' said he. 'I never dreamed that it was you.'

I found this tone of disappointment somewhat irritating. Instead of being glad at having met
a friend, he was sorry at having missed an enemy.

'I should have been happy to join in your sport, my dear Bart,' said I. 'But I really cannot
turn my sword upon a man who saved my life.'

'Tut, never mind about that.'

'No, it is impossible. I should never forgive myself.'

'You make too much of a trifle.'

'My mother's one desire is to embrace you. If ever you should be in Gascony----'

'Lord Wellington is coming there with 60,000 men.'

'Then one of them will have a chance of surviving,' said I, laughing. 'In the meantime, put
your sword in your sheath!'

Our horses were standing head to tail, and the Bart put out his hand and patted me on the thigh.

'You're a good chap, Gerard,' said he. 'I only wish you had been born on the right side of
the Channel.'

'I was,' said I.

'Poor devil!' he cried, with such an earnestness of pity that he set me laughing again. 'But
look here, Gerard,' he continued; 'this is all very well, but it is not business, you know.
I don't know what Massena would say to it, but our Chief would jump out of his riding-boots
if he saw us. We weren't sent out here for a picnic--either of us.'

'What would you have?'

'Well, we had a little argument about our hussars and dragoons, if you remember. I've got fifty
of the Sixteenth all chewing their carbine bullets behind me. You've got as many fine-looking
boys over yonder, who seem to be fidgeting in their saddles. If you and I took the right flanks
we should not spoil each other's beauty--though a little blood-letting is a friendly thing
in this climate.'

There seemed to me to be a good deal of sense in what he said. For the moment Mr Alexis Morgan
and the Countess of La Ronda and the Abbey of Almeixal went right out of my head, and I could
only think of the fine level turf and of the beautiful skirmish which we might have.

'Very good, Bart,' said I. 'We have seen the front of your dragoons. We shall now have a look
at their backs.'

'Any betting?' he asked.

'The stake,' said I, 'is nothing less than the honour of the Hussars of Conflans.'

'Well, come on!' he answered. 'If we break you, well and good--if you break us, it will be
all the better for Marshal Millefleurs.'

When he said that I could only stare at him in astonishment.

'Why for Marshal Millefleurs?' I asked.

'It is the name of a rascal who lives out this way. My dragoons have been sent by Lord Wellington
to see him safely hanged.'

'Name of a name!' I cried. 'Why, my hussars have been sent by Massena for that very object.'

We burst out laughing at that, and sheathed our swords. There was a whirr of steel from behind
us as our troopers followed our example.

'We are allies!' he cried.

'For a day.'

'We must join forces.'

'There is no doubt of it.'

And so, instead of fighting, we wheeled our half squadrons round and moved in two little columns
down the valley, the shakos and the helmets turned inwards, and the men looking their neighbours
up and down, like old fighting dogs with tattered ears who have learned to respect each other's
teeth. The most were on the broad grin, but there were some on either side who looked black
and challenging, especially the English sergeant and my own sub-officer Papilette. They were
men of habit, you see, who could not change all their ways of thinking in a moment. Besides,
Papilette had lost his only brother at Busaco. As for the Bart and me, we rode together at
the head and chatted about all that had occurred to us since that famous game of écarté of
which I have told you.

For my own part, I spoke to him of my adventures in England. They are a very singular people,
these English. Although he knew that I had been engaged in twelve campaigns, yet I am sure
that the Bart thought more highly of me because I had had an affair with the Bristol Bustler.
He told me, too, that the Colonel who presided over his court-martial for playing cards with
a prisoner acquitted him of neglect of duty, but nearly broke him because he thought that he
had not cleared his trumps before leading his suit. Yes, indeed, they are a singular people.

At the end of the valley the road curved over some rising ground before winding down into another
wider valley beyond. We called a halt when we came to the top; for there, right in front of
us, at the distance of about three miles, was a scattered, grey town, with a single enormous
building upon the flank of the mountain which overlooked it. We could not doubt that we were
at last in sight of the Abbey that held the gang of rascals whom we had come to disperse. It
was only now, I think, that we fully understood what a task lay in front of us, for the place
was a veritable fortress, and it was evident that cavalry should never have been sent out upon
such an errand.

'That's got nothing to do with us,' said the Bart; Wellington and Massena can settle that between
them.'

'Courage!' I answered. 'Piré took Leipzig with fifty hussars.'

'Had they been dragoons,' said the Bart, laughing, 'he would have had Berlin. But you are senior
officer; give us a lead, and we'll see who will be the first to flinch.'

'Well,' said I, 'whatever we do must be done at once, for my orders are to be on my way to
Abrantes by tomorrow night. But we must have some information first, and here is someone who
should be able to give it to us.'

There was a square, whitewashed house standing by the roadside, which appeared, from the bush
hanging over the door, to be one of those wayside tabernas which are provided for the muleteers.
A lantern was hung in the porch, and by its light we saw two men, the one in the brown habit
of a Capuchin monk, and the other girt with an apron, which showed him to be the landlord.
They were conversing together so earnestly that we were upon them before they were aware of
us. The innkeeper turned to fly, but one of the Englishmen seized him by the hair, and held
him tight.

'For mercy's sake, spare me,' he yelled. 'My house has been gutted by the French and harried
by the English, and my feet have been burned by the brigands. I swear by the Virgin that I
have neither money nor food in my inn, and the good Father Abbot, who is starving upon my doorstep,
will be witness to it.'

'Indeed, sir,' said the Capuchin, in excellent French, 'what this worthy man says is very true.
He is one of the many victims to these cruel wars, although his loss is but a feather-weight
compared to mine. Let him go,' he added, in English, to the trooper, 'he is too weak to fly,
even if he desired to.'

In the light of the lantern I saw that this monk was a magnificent man, dark and bearded, with
the eyes of a hawk, and so tall that his cowl came up to Rataplan's ears. He wore the look
of one who had been through much suffering, but he carried himself like a king, and we could
form some opinion of his learning when we each heard him talk our own language as fluently
as if he were born to it.

'You have nothing to fear,' said I, to the trembling innkeeper. 'As to you, father, you are,
if I am not mistaken, the very man who can give us the information which we require.'

'All that I have is at your service, my son. But,' he added, with a wan smile, 'my Lenten fare
is always somewhat meagre, and this year it has been such that I must ask you for a crust of
bread if I am to have the strength to answer your questions.'

We bore two days' rations in our haversacks, so that he soon had the little he asked for. It
was dreadful to see the wolfish way in which he seized the piece of dried goat's flesh which
I was able to offer him.

'Time presses, and we must come to the point,' said I. 'We want your advice as to the weak
points of yonder Abbey, and concerning the habits of the rascals who infest it.'

He cried out something which I took to be Latin, with his hands clasped and his eyes upturned.
'The prayer of the just availeth much,' said he, 'and yet I had not dared to hope that mine
would have been so speedily answered. In me you see the unfortunate Abbot of Almeixal, who
has been cast out by this rabble of three armies with their heretical leader. Oh! to think
of what I have lost!' his voice broke, and the tears hung upon his lashes.

'Cheer up, sir,' said the Bart. 'I'll lay nine to four that we have you back again by tomorrow
night.'

It is not of my own welfare that I think,' said he, 'nor even of that of my poor, scattered
flock. But it is of the holy relics which are left in the sacrilegious hands of these robbers.'

'It's even betting whether they would ever bother their heads about them,' said the Bart. 'But
show us the way inside the gates, and we'll soon clear the place out for you.'

In a few short words the good Abbot gave us the very points that we wished to know. But all
that he said only made our task more formidable. The walls of the Abbey were forty feet high.
The lower windows were barricaded, and the whole building loopholed for musketry fire. The
gang preserved military discipline, and their sentries were too numerous for us to hope to
take them by surprise. It was more than ever evident that a battalion of grenadiers and a couple
of breaching pieces were what was needed. I raised my eyebrows, and the Bart began to whistle.

'We must have a shot at it, come what may,' said he.

The men had already dismounted, and, having watered their horses, were eating their suppers.
For my own part I went into the sitting-room of the inn with the Abbot and the Bart, that we
might talk about our plans.

I had a little cognac in my sauve vie, and I divided it among us--just enough to wet our moustaches.

'It is unlikely,' said I, 'that those rascals know anything about our coming. I have seen no
signs of scouts along the road. My own plan is that we should conceal ourselves in some neighbouring
wood, and then, when they open their gates, charge down upon them and take them by surprise.'

The Bart was of opinion that this was the best that we could do, but, when we came to talk
it over, the Abbot made us see that there were difficulties in the way.

'Save on the side of the town, there is no place within a mile of the Abbey where you could
shelter man or horse,' said he. 'As to the townsfolk, they are not to be trusted. I fear, my
son, that your excellent plan would have little chance of success in the face of the vigilant
guard which these men keep.'

'I see no other way,' answered I. 'Hussars of Conflans are not so plentiful that I can afford
to run half a squadron of them against a forty-foot wall with five hundred infantry behind it.'

'I am a man of peace,' said the Abbot, 'and yet I may, perhaps, give a word of counsel. I know
these villains and their ways. Who should do so better, seeing that I have stayed for a month
in this lonely spot, looking down in weariness of heart at the Abbey which was my own? I will
tell you now what I should myself do if I were in your place.'

'Pray tell us, father,' we cried, both together.

'You must know that bodies of deserters, both French and English, are continually coming in
to them, carrying their weapons with them. Now, what is there to prevent you and your men from
pretending to be such a body, and so making your way into the Abbey?'

I was amazed at the simplicity of the thing, and I embraced the good Abbot. The Bart, however,
had some objections to offer.

'That is all very well,' said he, 'but if these fellows are as sharp as you say, it is not
very likely that they are going to let a hundred armed strangers into their crib. From all
I have heard of Mr Morgan, or Marshal Millefleurs, or whatever the rascal's name is, I give
him credit for more sense than that.'

'Well, then,' I cried, 'let us send fifty in, and let them at daybreak throw open the gates
to the other fifty, who will be waiting outside.'

We discussed the question at great length and with much foresight and discretion. If it had
been Massena and Wellington instead of two young officers of light cavalry, we could not have
weighed it all with more judgment. At last we agreed, the Bart and I, that one of us should
indeed go with fifty men, under pretence of being deserters, and that in the early morning
he should gain command of the gate and admit the others. The Abbot, it is true, was still of
opinion that it was dangerous to divide our force, but finding that we were both of the same
mind, he shrugged his shoulders and gave in.

'There is only one thing that I would ask,' said he. 'If you lay hands upon this Marshal Millefleurs--this
dog of a brigand--what will you do with him?'

'Hang him,' I answered.

'It is too easy a death,' cried the Capuchin, with a vindictive glow in his dark eyes. 'Had
I my way with him--but, oh, what thoughts are these for a servant of God to harbour!' He clapped
his hands to his forehead like one who is half demented by his troubles, and rushed out of
the room.

There was an important point which we had still to settle, and that was whether the French
or the English party should have the honour of entering the Abbey first. My faith, it was asking
a great deal of Etienne Gerard that he should give place to any man at such a time! But the
poor Bart pleaded so hard, urging the few skirmishes which he had seen against my four-and-seventy
engagements, that at last I consented that he should go. We had just clasped hands over the
matter when there broke out such a shouting and cursing and yelling from the front of the inn,
that out we rushed with our drawn sabres in our hands, convinced that the brigands were upon us.

You may imagine our feelings when, by the light of the lantern which hung from the porch, we
saw a score of our hussars and dragoons all mixed in one wild heap, red coats and blue, helmets
and busbies, pommelling each other to their hearts' content. We flung ourselves upon them,
imploring, threatening, tugging at a lace collar, or at a spurred heel, until, at last, we
had dragged them all apart. There they stood, flushed and bleeding, glaring at each other,
and all panting together like a line of troop horses after a ten-mile chase. It was only with
our drawn swords that we could keep them from each other's throats. The poor Capuchin stood
in the porch in his long brown habit, wringing his hands and calling upon all the saints for mercy.

He was, indeed, as I found upon inquiry, the innocent cause of all the turmoil, for, not understanding
how soldiers look upon such things, he had made some remark to the English sergeant that it
was a pity that his squadron was not as good as the French. The words were not out of his mouth
before a dragoon knocked down the nearest hussar, and then, in a moment, they all flew at each
other like tigers. We would trust them no more after that, but the Bart moved his men to the
front of the inn, and I mine to the back, the English all scowling and silent, and our fellows
shaking their fists and chattering, each after the fashion of their own people.

Well, as our plans were made, we thought it best to carry them out at once, lest some fresh
cause of quarrel should break out between our followers. The Bart and his men rode off, therefore,
he having first torn the lace from his sleeves, and the gorget and sash from his uniform, so
that he might pass as a simple trooper. He explained to his men what it was that was expected
of them, and though they did not raise a cry or wave their weapons as mine might have done,
there was an expression upon their stolid and clean-shaven faces which filled me with confidence.
Their tunics were left unbuttoned, their scabbards and helmets stained with dirt, and their
harness badly fastened, so that they might look the part of deserters, without order or discipline.
At six o'clock next morning they were to gain command of the main gate of the Abbey, while
at that same hour my hussars were to gallop up to it from outside. The Bart and I pledged our
words to it before he trotted off with his detachment. My sergeant, Papilette, with two troopers,
followed the English at a distance, and returned in half an hour to say that, after some parley,
and the flashing of lanterns upon them from the grille, they had been admitted into the Abbey.

So far, then, all had gone well. It was a cloudy night with a sprinkling of rain, which was
in our favour, as there was the less chance of our presence being discovered. My vedettes I
placed two hundred yards in every direction, to guard against a surprise, and also to prevent
any peasant who might stumble upon us from carrying the news to the Abbey. Oudin and Papilette
were to take turns of duty, while the others with their horses had snug quarters in a great
wooden granary. Having walked round and seen that all was as it should be, I flung myself upon
the bed which the innkeeper had set apart for me, and fell into a dreamless sleep.

No doubt you have heard my name mentioned as being the beau-ideal of a soldier, and that not
only by friends and admirers like our fellow-townsfolk, but also by old officers of the great
wars who have shared the fortunes of those famous campaigns with me. Truth and modesty compel
me to say, however, that this is not so. There are some gifts which I lack--very few, no doubt--but,
still, amid the vast armies of the Emperor there may have been some who were free from those
blemishes which stood between me and perfection. Of bravery I say nothing. Those who have seen
me in the field are best fitted to speak about that. I have often heard the soldiers discussing
round the camp-fires as to who was the bravest man in the Grand Army. Some said Murat, and
some said Lasalle, and some Ney; but for my own part, when they asked me, I merely shrugged
my shoulders and smiled. It would have seemed mere conceit if I had answered that there was
no man braver than Brigadier Gerard. At the same time, facts are facts, and a man knows best
what his own feelings are. But there are other gifts besides bravery which are necessary for
a soldier, and one of them is that he should be a light sleeper. Now, from my boyhood onwards,
I have been hard to wake, and it was this which brought me to ruin upon that night.

It may have been about two o'clock in the morning that I was suddenly conscious of a feeling
of suffocation. I tried to call out, but there was something which prevented me from uttering
a sound. I struggled to rise, but I could only flounder like a hamstrung horse. I was strapped
at the ankles, strapped at the knees, and strapped again at the wrists. Only my eyes were free
to move, and there at the foot of my couch, by the light of a Portuguese lamp, whom should
I see but the Abbot and the innkeeper!

The latter's heavy, white face had appeared to me when I looked upon it the evening before
to express nothing but stupidity and terror. Now, on the contrary, every feature bespoke brutality
and ferocity. Never have I seen a more dreadful-looking villain. In his hand he held a long,
dull-coloured knife. The Abbot, on the other hand, was as polished and as dignified as ever.
His Capuchin gown had been thrown open, however, and I saw beneath it a black, frogged coat,
such as I have seen among the English officers. As our eyes met he leaned over the wooden end
of the bed and laughed silently until it creaked again.

'You will, I am sure, excuse my mirth, my dear Colonel Gerard,' said he. 'The fact is, that
the expression upon your face when you grasped the situation was just a little funny. I have
no doubt that you are an excellent soldier, but I hardly think that you are fit to measure
wits with the Marshal Millefleurs, as your fellows have been good enough to call me. You appear
to have given me credit for singularly little intelligence, which argues, if I may be allowed
to say so, a want of acuteness upon your own part. Indeed, with the single exception of my
thick-headed compatriot, the British dragoon, I have never met anyone who was less competent
to carry out such a mission.'

You can imagine how I felt and how I looked, as I listened to this insolent harangue, which
was all delivered in that flowery and condescending manner which had gained this rascal his
nickname. I could say nothing, but they must have read my threat in my eyes, for the fellow
who had played the part of the innkeeper whispered something to his companion.

'No, no, my dear Chenier, he will be infinitely more valuable alive,' said he. 'By the way,
Colonel, it is just as well that you are a sound sleeper, for my friend here, who is a little
rough in his ways, would certainly have cut your throat if you had raised any alarm. I should
recommend you to keep in his good graces, for Sergeant Chenier, late of the 7th Imperial Light
Infantry, is a much more dangerous person than Captain Alexis Morgan, of His Majesty's foot-guards.'

Chenier grinned and shook his knife at me, while I tried to look the loathing which I felt
at the thought that a soldier of the Emperor could fall so low.

'It may amuse you to know,' said the Marshal, in that soft, suave voice of his, 'that both
your expeditions were watched from the time that you left your respective camps. I think that
you will allow that Chenier and I played our parts with some subtlety. We had made every arrangement
for your reception at the Abbey, though we had hoped to receive the whole squadron instead
of half. When the gates are secured behind them, our visitors will find themselves in a very
charming little mediaeval quadrangle, with no possible exit, commanded by musketry fire from
a hundred windows. They may choose to be shot down; or they may choose to surrender. Between
ourselves, I have not the slightest doubt that they have been wise enough to do the latter.
But since you are naturally interested in the matter, we thought that you would care to come
with us and to see for yourself. I think I can promise you that you will find your titled friend
waiting for you at the Abbey with a face as long as your own.'

The two villains began whispering together, debating, as far as I could hear, which was the
best way of avoiding my vedettes.

'I will make sure that it is all clear upon the other side of the barn,' said the Marshal at
last. 'You will stay here, my good Chenier, and if the prisoner gives any trouble you will
know what to do.'

So we were left together, this murderous renegade and I--he sitting at the end of the bed,
sharpening his knife upon his boot in the light of the single smoky little oil-lamp. As to
me, I only wonder now, as I look back upon it, that I did not go mad with vexation and self-reproach
as I lay helplessly upon the couch, unable to utter a word or move a finger, with the knowledge
that my fifty gallant lads were so close to me, and yet with no means of letting them know
the straits to which I was reduced. It was no new thing for me to be a prisoner; but to be
taken by these renegades, and to be led into their Abbey in the midst of their jeers, befooled
and out-witted by their insolent leaders--that was indeed more than I could endure. The knife
of the butcher beside me would cut less deeply than that.

I twitched softly at my wrists, and then at my ankles, but whichever of the two had secured
me was no bungler at his work. I could not move either of them an inch. Then I tried to work
the handkerchief down over my mouth, but the ruffian beside me raised his knife with such a
threatening snarl that I had to desist. I was lying still looking at his bull neck, and wondering
whether it would ever be my good fortune to fit it for a cravat, when I heard returning steps
coming down the inn passage and up the stair. What word would the villain bring back? If he
found it impossible to kidnap me, he would probably murder me where I lay. For my own part,
I was indifferent which it might be, and I looked at the doorway with the contempt and defiance
which I longed to put into words. But you can imagine my feelings, my dear friends, when, instead
of the tall figure and dark, sneering face of the Capuchin, my eyes fell upon the grey pelisse
and huge moustaches of my good little sub-officer, Papilette!

The French soldier of those days had seen too much to be ever taken by surprise. His eyes had
hardly rested upon my bound figure and the sinister face beside me before he had seen how the
matter lay.

'Sacred name of a dog!' he growled, and out flashed his great sabre. Chenier sprang forward
at him with his knife, and then, thinking better of it, he darted back and stabbed frantically
at my heart. For my own part, I had hurled myself off the bed on the side opposite to him,
and the blade grazed my side before ripping its way through blanket and sheet. An instant later
I heard the thud of a heavy fall, and then almost simultaneously a second object struck the
floor--something lighter but harder, which rolled under the bed. I will not horrify you with
details, my friends. Suffice it that Papilette was one of the strongest swordsmen in the regiment,
and that his sabre was heavy and sharp. It left a red blotch upon my wrists and my ankles,
as it cut the thongs which bound me.

When I had thrown off my gag, the first use which I made of my lips was to kiss the sergeant's
scarred cheeks. The next was to ask him if all was well with the command. Yes, they had had
no alarms. Oudin had just relieved him, and he had come to report. Had he seen the Abbot? No,
he had seen nothing of him. Then we must form a cordon and prevent his escape. I was hurrying
out to give the orders, when I heard a slow and measured step enter the door below, and come
creaking up the stairs.

Papilette understood it all in an instant. 'You are not to kill him,' I whispered, and thrust
him into the shadow on one side of the door; I crouched on the other. Up he came, up and up,
and every footfall seemed to be upon my heart. The brown skirt of his gown was not over the
threshold before we were both on him, like two wolves on a buck. Down we crashed, the three
of us, he fighting like a tiger, and with such amazing strength that he might have broken away
from the two of us. Thrice he got to his feet, and thrice we had him over again, until Papilette
made him feel that there was a point to his sabre. He had sense enough then to know that the
game was up, and to lie still while I lashed him with the very cords which had been round my
own limbs.

'There has been a fresh deal, my fine fellow,' said I, 'and you will find that I have some
of the trumps in my hand this time.'

'Luck always comes to the aid of a fool,' he answered. 'Perhaps it is as well, otherwise the
world would fall too completely into the power of the astute. So, you have killed Chenier,
I see. He was an insubordinate dog, and always smelt abominably of garlic. Might I trouble
you to lay me upon the bed? The floor of these Portuguese tabernas is hardly a fitting couch
for anyone who has prejudices in favour of cleanliness.'

I could not but admire the coolness of the man, and the way in which he preserved the same
insolent air of condescension in spite of this sudden turning of the tables. I dispatched Papilette
to summon a guard, whilst I stood over our prisoner with my drawn sword, never taking my eyes
off him for an instant, for I must confess that I had conceived a great respect for his audacity
and resource.

'I trust,' said he, 'that your men will treat me in a becoming manner.'

'You will get your deserts--you may depend upon that.'

'I ask nothing more. You may not be aware of my exalted birth, but I am so placed that I cannot
name my father without treason, nor my mother without a scandal. I cannot claim Royal honours,
but these things are so much more graceful when they are conceded without a claim. The thongs
are cutting my skin. Might I beg you to loosen them?'

'You do not give me credit for much intelligence,' I remarked, repeating his own words.

'Touché,' he cried, like a pinked fencer. 'But here come your men, so it matters little whether
you loosen them or not.'

I ordered the gown to be stripped from him and placed him under a strong guard. Then, as morning
was already breaking, I had to consider what my next step was to be. The poor Bart and his
Englishmen had fallen victims to the deep scheme which might, had we adopted all the crafty
suggestions of our adviser, have ended in the capture of the whole instead of the half of our
force. I must extricate them if it were still possible. Then there was the old lady, the Countess
of La Ronda, to be thought of. As to the Abbey, since its garrison was on the alert it was
hopeless to think of capturing that. All turned now upon the value which they placed upon their
leader. The game depended upon my playing that one card. I will tell you how boldly and how
skilfully I played it.

It was hardly light before my bugler blew the assembly, and out we trotted on to the plain.
My prisoner was placed on horseback in the very centre of the troops. It chanced that there
was a large tree just out of musket-shot from the main gate of the Abbey, and under this we
halted. Had they opened the great doors in order to attack us, I should have charged home upon
them; but, as I had expected, they stood upon the defensive, lining the long wall and pouring
down a torrent of hootings and taunts and derisive laughter upon us. A few fired their muskets,
but finding that we were out of reach they soon ceased to waste their powder. It was the strangest
sight to see that mixture of uniforms, French, English, and Portuguese, cavalry, infantry,
and artillery, all wagging their heads and shaking their fists at us.

My word, their hubbub soon died away when we opened our ranks, and showed whom we had got in
the midst of us! There was silence for a few seconds, and then such a howl of rage and grief!
I could see some of them dancing like mad-men upon the wall. He must have been a singular person,
this prisoner of ours, to have gained the affection of such a gang.

I had brought a rope from the inn, and we slung it over the lower bough of the tree.

'You will permit me, monsieur, to undo your collar,' said Papilette, with mock politeness.

'If your hands are perfectly clean,' answered our prisoner, and set the whole half-squadron
laughing.

There was another yell from the wall, followed by a profound hush as the noose was tightened
round Marshal Millefleurs' neck. Then came a shriek from a bugle, the Abbey gates flew open,
and three men rushed out waving white cloths in their hands. Ah, how my heart bounded with
joy at the sight of them. And yet I would not advance an inch to meet them, so that all the
eagerness might seem to be upon their side. I allowed my trumpeter, however, to wave a handkerchief
in reply, upon which the three envoys came running towards us. The Marshal, still pinioned,
and with the rope round his neck, sat his horse with a half smile, as one who is slightly bored
and yet strives out of courtesy not to show it. If I were in such a situation I could not wish
to carry myself better, and surely I can say no more than that.

They were a singular trio, these ambassadors. The one was a Portuguese caçadore in his dark
uniform, the second a French chasseur in the lightest green, and the third a big English artilleryman
in blue and gold. They saluted, all three, and the Frenchman did the talking.

'We have thirty-seven English dragoons in our hands,' said he. 'We give you our most solemn
oath that they shall all hang from the Abbey wall within five minutes of the death of our Marshal.'

'Thirty-seven!' I cried. 'You have fifty-one.'

'Fourteen were cut down before they could be secured.'

'And the officer?'

'He would not surrender his sword save with his life. It was not our fault. We would have saved
him if we could.'

Alas for my poor Bart! I had met him but twice, and yet he was a man very much after my heart.
I have always had a regard for the English for the sake of that one friend. A braver man and
a worse swordsman I have never met.

I did not, as you may think, take these rascals' word for anything. Papilette was dispatched
with one of them, and returned to say that it was too true. I had now to think of the living.

'You will release the thirty-seven dragoons if I free your leader?'

'We will give you ten of them.'

'Up with him!' I cried.

'Twenty,' shouted the chasseur.

'No more words,' said I. 'Pull on the rope!'

'All of them,' cried the envoy, as the cord tightened round the Marshal's neck.

'With horses and arms?'

They could see that I was not a man to jest with.

'All complete,' said the chasseur, sulkily.

'And the Countess of La Ronda as well?' said I.

But here I met with firmer opposition. No threats of mine could induce them to give up the
Countess. We tightened the cord. We moved the horse. We did all but leave the Marshal suspended.
If once I broke his neck the dragoons were dead men. It was as precious to me as to them.

'Allow me to remark,' said the Marshal, blandly, 'that you are exposing me to a risk of a quinsy.
Do you not think, since there is a difference of opinion upon this point, that it would be
an excellent idea to consult the lady herself? We would neither of us, I am sure, wish to override
her own inclinations.'

Nothing could be more satisfactory. You can imagine how quickly I grasped at so simple a solution.
In ten minutes she was before us, a most stately dame, with her grey curls peeping out from
under her mantilla. Her face was as yellow as though it reflected the countless doubloons of
her treasury.

'This gentleman,' said the Marshal, 'is exceedingly anxious to convey you to a place where
you will never see us more. It is for you to decide whether you would wish to go with him,
or whether you prefer to remain with me.'

She was at his horse's side in an instant. 'My own Alexis,' she cried, 'nothing can ever part us.'

He looked at me with a sneer upon his handsome face.

'By the way, you made a small slip of the tongue, my dear Colonel,' said he. 'Except by courtesy,
no such person exists as the Dowager Countess of La Ronda. The lady whom I have the honour
to present to you is my very dear wife, Mrs Alexis Morgan--or shall I say Madame la Marèchale
Millefleurs?'

It was at this moment that I came to the conclusion that I was dealing with the cleverest,
and also the most unscrupulous, man whom I had ever met. As I looked upon this unfortunate
old woman my soul was filled with wonder and disgust. As for her, her eyes were raised to his
face with such a look as a young recruit might give to the Emperor.

'So be it,' said I at last; 'give me the dragoons and let me go.'

They were brought out with their horses and weapons, and the rope was taken from the Marshal's
neck.

'Good-bye, my dear Colonel,' said he. 'I am afraid that you will have rather a lame account
to give of your mission, when you find your way back to Massena, though, from all I hear, he
will probably be too busy to think of you. I am free to confess that you have extricated yourself
from your difficulties with greater ability than I had given you credit for. I presume that
there is nothing which I can do for you before you go?'

'There is one thing.'

'And that is?'

'To give fitting burial to this young officer and his men.'

'I pledge my word to it.'

'And there is one other.'

'Name it.'

'To give me five minutes in the open with a sword in your hand and a horse between your legs.'

'Tut, tut!' said he. 'I should either have to cut short your promising career, or else to bid
adieu to my own bonny bride. It is unreasonable to ask such a request of a man in the first
joys of matrimony.'

I gathered my horsemen together and wheeled them into column.

'Au revoir,' I cried, shaking my sword at him. 'The next time you may not escape so easily.'

'Au revoir,' he answered. 'When you are weary of the Emperor, you will always find a commission
waiting for you in the service of the Marshal Millefleurs.'

6. HOW THE BRIGADIER PLAYED FOR A KINGDOM

It has sometimes struck me that some of you, when you have heard me tell these little adventures
of mine, may have gone away with the impression that I was conceited. There could not be a
greater mistake than this, for I have always observed that really fine soldiers are free from
this failing. It is true that I have had to depict myself sometimes as brave, sometimes as
full of resource, always as interesting; but, then, it really was so, and I had to take the
facts as I found them. It would be an unworthy affectation if I were to pretend that my career
has been anything but a fine one. The incident which I will tell you tonight, however, is one
which you will understand that only a modest man would describe. After all, when one has attained
such a position as mine, one can afford to speak of what an ordinary man might be tempted to
conceal.

You must know, then, that after the Russian campaign the remains of our poor army were quartered
along the western bank of the Elbe, where they might thaw their frozen blood and try, with
the help of the good German beer, to put a little between their skin and their bones. There
were some things which we could not hope to regain, for I daresay that three large commissariat
fourgons would not have sufficed to carry the fingers and the toes which the army had shed
during that retreat. Still, lean and crippled as we were, we had much to be thankful for when
we thought of our poor comrades whom we had left behind, and of the snowfields--the horrible,
horrible snowfields. To this day, my friends, I do not care to see red and white together.
Even my red cap thrown down upon my white counterpane has given me dreams in which I have seen
those monstrous plains, the reeling, tortured army, and the crimson smears which glared upon
the snow behind them. You will coax no story out of me about that business, for the thought
of it is enough to turn my wine to vinegar and my tobacco to straw.

Of the half-million who crossed the Elbe in the autumn of the year '12 about forty thousand
infantry were left in the spring of '13. But they were terrible men, these forty thousand:
men of iron, eaters of horses, and sleepers in the snow; filled, too, with rage and bitterness
against the Russians. They would hold the Elbe until the great army of conscripts, which the
Emperor was raising in France, should be ready to help them to cross it once more.

But the cavalry was in a deplorable condition. My own hussars were at Borna, and when I paraded
them first, I burst into tears at the sight of them. My fine men and my beautiful horses--it
broke my heart to see the state to which they were reduced. 'But, courage,' I thought, 'they
have lost much, but their Colonel is still left to them.' I set to work, therefore, to repair
their disasters, and had already constructed two good squadrons, when an order came that all
colonels of cavalry should repair instantly to the depôts of the regiments in France to organize
the recruits and the remounts for the coming campaign.

You will think, doubtless, that I was over-joyed at this chance of visiting home once more.
I will not deny that it was a pleasure to me to know that I should see my mother again, and
there were a few girls who would be very glad at the news; but there were others in the army
who had a stronger claim. I would have given my place to any who had wives and children whom
they might not see again. However, there is no arguing when the blue paper with the little
red seal arrives, so within an hour I was off upon my great ride from the Elbe to the Vosges.
At last I was to have a period of quiet. War lay behind my mare's tail and peace in front of
her nostrils. So I thought, as the sound of the bugles died in the distance, and the long,
white road curled away in front of me through plain and forest and mountain, with France somewhere
beyond the blue haze which lay upon the horizon.

It is interesting, but it is also fatiguing, to ride in the rear of an army. In the harvest
time our soldiers could do without supplies, for they had been trained to pluck the grain in
the fields as they passed, and to grind it for themselves in their bivouacs. It was at that
time of year, therefore, that those swift marches were performed which were the wonder and
the despair of Europe. But now the starving men had to be made robust once more, and I was
forced to draw into the ditch continually as the Coburg sheep and the Bavarian bullocks came
streaming past with waggon loads of Berlin beer and good French cognac. Sometimes, too, I would
hear the dry rattle of the drums and the shrill whistle of the fifes, and long columns of our
good little infantry men would swing past me with the white dust lying thick upon their blue
tunics. These were old soldiers drawn from the garrisons of our German fortresses, for it was
not until May that the new conscripts began to arrive from France.

Well, I was rather tired of this eternal stopping and dodging, so that I was not sorry when
I came to Altenburg to find that the road divided, and that I could take the southern and quieter
branch. There were few wayfarers between there and Greiz, and the road wound through groves
of oaks and beeches, which shot their branches across the path. You will think it strange that
a Colonel of hussars should again and again pull up his horse in order to admire the beauty
of the feathery branches and the little, green, new-budded leaves, but if you had spent six
months among the fir trees of Russia you would be able to understand me.

There was something, however, which pleased me very much less than the beauty of the forests,
and that was the words and looks of the folk who lived in the woodland villages. We had always
been excellent friends with the Germans, and during the last six years they had never seemed
to bear us any malice for having made a little free with their country. We had shown kindnesses
to the men and received them from the women, so that good, comfortable Germany was a second
home to all of us. But now there was something which I could not understand in the behaviour
of the people. The travellers made no answer to my salute; the foresters turned their heads
away to avoid seeing me; and in the villages the folk would gather into knots in the roadway
and would scowl at me as I passed. Even women would do this, and it was something new for me
in those days to see anything but a smile in a woman's eyes when they were turned upon me.

It was in the hamlet of Schmolin, just ten miles out of Altenburg, that the thing became most
marked. I had stopped at the little inn there just to damp my moustache and to wash the dust
out of poor Violette's throat. It was my way to give some little compliment, or possibly a
kiss, to the maid who served me; but this one would have neither the one nor the other, but
darted a glance at me like a bayonet-thrust. Then when I raised my glass to the folk who drank
their beer by the door they turned their backs on me, save only one fellow, who cried, 'Here's
a toast for you, boys! Here's to the letter T!' At that they all emptied their beer mugs and
laughed; but it was not a laugh that had good-fellowship in it.

I was turning this over in my head and wondering what their boorish conduct could mean, when
I saw, as I rode from the village, a great T new carved upon a tree. I had already seen more
than one in my morning's ride, but I had given no thought to them until the words of the beer-drinker
gave them an importance. It chanced that a respectable-looking person was riding past me at
the moment, so I turned to him for information.

'Can you tell me, sir,' said I, 'what this letter T is?'

He looked at it and then at me in the most singular fashion. 'Young man,' said he, 'it is not
the letter N.' Then before I could ask further he clapped his spurs into his horses ribs and
rode, stomach to earth, upon his way.

At first his words had no particular significance in my mind, but as I trotted onwards Violette
chanced to half turn her dainty head, and my eyes were caught by the gleam of the brazen N's
at the end of the bridle-chain. It was the Emperor's mark. And those T's meant something which
was opposite to it. Things had been happening in Germany, then, during our absence, and the
giant sleeper had begun to stir. I thought of the mutinous faces that I had seen, and I felt
that if I could only have looked into the hearts of these people I might have had some strange
news to bring into France with me. It made me the more eager to get my remounts, and to see
ten strong squadrons behind my kettle-drums once more.

While these thoughts were passing through my head I had been alternately walking and trotting,
as a man should who has a long journey before, and a willing horse beneath, him. The woods
were very open at this point, and beside the road there lay a great heap of fagots. As I passed
there came a sharp sound from among them, and, glancing round, I saw a face looking out at
me--a hot, red face, like that of a man who is beside himself with excitement and anxiety.
A second glance told me that it was the very person with whom I had talked an hour before in
the village.

'Come nearer!' he hissed. 'Nearer still! Now dismount and pretend to be mending the stirrup
leather. Spies may be watching us, and it means death to me if I am seen helping you.'

'Death!' I whispered. 'From whom?'

'From the Tugendbund. From Lutzow's night-riders. You Frenchmen are living on a powder magazine,
and the match has been struck that will fire it.'

'But this is all strange to me,' said I, still fumbling at the leathers of my horse. 'What
is this Tugendbund?'

'It is the secret society which has planned the great rising which is to drive you out of Germany,
just as you have been driven out of Russia.'

'And these T's stand for it?'

'They are the signal. I should have told you all this in the village, but I dared not be seen
speaking with you. I galloped through the woods to cut you off, and concealed both my horse
and myself.'

'I am very much indebted to you,' said I, 'and the more so as you are the only German that
I have met today from whom I have had common civility.'

'All that I possess I have gained through contracting for the French armies,' said he. 'Your
Emperor has been a good friend to me. But I beg that you will ride on now, for we have talked
long enough. Beware only of Lutzow's night-riders!'

'Banditti?' I asked.

'All that is best in Germany,' said he. 'But for God's sake ride forwards, for I have risked
my life and exposed my good name in order to carry you this warning.'

Well, if I had been heavy with thought before, you can think how I felt after my strange talk
with the man among the fagots. What came home to me even more than his words was his shivering,
broken voice, his twitching face, and his eyes glancing swiftly to right and left, and opening
in horror whenever a branch cracked upon a tree. It was clear that he was in the last extremity
of terror, and it is possible that he had cause, for shortly after I had left him I heard a
distant gunshot and a shouting from somewhere behind me. It may have been some sportsman halloaing
to his dogs, but I never again heard of or saw the man who had given me my warning.

I kept a good look-out after this, riding swiftly where the country was open, and slowly where
there might be an ambuscade. It was serious for me, since 500 good miles of German soil lay
in front of me; but somehow I did not take it very much to heart, for the Germans had always
seemed to me to be a kindly, gentle people, whose hands closed more readily round a pipe-stem
than a sword-hilt--not out of want of valour, you understand, but because they are genial,
open souls, who would rather be on good terms with all men. I did not know then that beneath
that homely surface there lurks a devilry as fierce as, and far more persistent than, that
of the Castilian or the Italian.

And it was not long before I had shown to me that there was something more serious abroad than
rough words and hard looks. I had come to a spot where the road runs upwards through a wild
tract of heath-land and vanishes into an oak wood. I may have been half-way up the hill when,
looking forward, I saw something gleaming under the shadow of the tree-trunks, and a man came
out with a coat which was so slashed and spangled with gold that he blazed like a fire in the
sunlight. He appeared to be very drunk, for he reeled and staggered as he came towards me.
One of his hands was held up to his ear and clutched a great red handkerchief, which was fixed
to his neck.

I had reined up the mare and was looking at him with some disgust, for it seemed strange to
me that one who wore so gorgeous a uniform should show himself in such a state in broad daylight.
For his part, he looked hard in my direction and came slowly onwards, stopping from time to
time and swaying about as he gazed at me. Suddenly, as I again advanced, he screamed out his
thanks to Christ, and, lurching forwards, he fell with a crash upon the dusty road. His hands
flew forward with the fall, and I saw that what I had taken for a red cloth was a monstrous
wound, which had left a great gap in his neck, from which a dark blood-clot hung, like an epaulette
upon his shoulder.

'My God!' I cried, as I sprang to his aid. 'And I thought that you were drunk!'

'Not drunk, but dying,' said he. 'But thank Heaven that I have seen a French officer while
I have still strength to speak.'

I laid him among the heather and poured some brandy down his throat. All round us was the vast
countryside, green and peaceful, with nothing living in sight save only the mutilated man beside
me.

'Who has done this?' I asked, 'and what are you? You are French, and yet the uniform is strange
to me.'

'It is that of the Emperor's new guard of honour. I am the Marquis of Château St Arnaud, and
I am the ninth of my blood who has died in the service of France. I have been pursued and wounded
by the night-riders of Lutzow, but I hid among the brushwood yonder, and waited in the hope
that a Frenchman might pass. I could not be sure at first if you were friend or foe, but I
felt that death was very near, and that I must take the chance.'

'Keep your heart up, comrade,' said I; 'I have seen a man with a worse wound who has lived
to boast of it.'

'No, no,' he whispered; 'I am going fast.' He laid his hand upon mine as he spoke, and I saw
that his finger-nails were already blue. 'But I have papers here in my tunic which you must
carry at once to the Prince of Saxe-Felstein, at his Castle of Hof. He is still true to us,
but the Princess is our deadly enemy. She is striving to make him declare against us. If he
does so, it will determine all those who are wavering, for the King of Prussia is his uncle
and the King of Bavaria his cousin. These papers will hold him to us if they can only reach
him before he takes the last step. Place them in his hands tonight, and, perhaps, you will
have saved all Germany for the Emperor. Had my horse not been shot, I might, wounded as I am----'
He choked, and the cold hand tightened into a grip, which left mine as bloodless as itself.
Then, with a groan, his head jerked back, and it was all over with him.

Here was a fine start for my journey home. I was left with a commission of which I knew little,
which would lead me to delay the pressing needs of my hussars, and which at the same time was
of such importance that it was impossible for me to avoid it. I opened the Marquis's tunic,
the brilliance of which had been devised by the Emperor in order to attract those young aristocrats
from whom he hoped to raise these new regiments of his Guard. It was a small packet of papers
which I drew out, tied up with silk, and addressed to the Prince of Saxe-Felstein. In the corner,
in a sprawling, untidy hand, which I knew to be the Emperor's own, was written: 'Pressing and
most important.' It was an order to me, those four words--an order as clear as if it had come
straight from the firm lips with the cold grey eyes looking into mine. My troopers might wait
for their horses, the dead Marquis might lie where I had laid him amongst the heather, but
if the mare and her rider had a breath left in them the papers should reach the Prince that night.

I should not have feared to ride by the road through the wood, for I have learned in Spain
that the safest time to pass through a guerilla country is after an outrage, and that the moment
of danger is when all is peaceful. When I came to look upon my map, however, I saw that Hof
lay further to the south of me, and that I might reach it more directly by keeping to the moors.
Off I set, therefore, and had not gone fifty yards before two carbine shots rang out of the
brushwood and a bullet hummed past me like a bee. It was clear that the night-riders were bolder
in their ways than the brigands of Spain, and that my mission would have ended where it had
begun if I had kept to the road.

It was a mad ride, that--a ride with a loose rein, girth-deep in heather and in gorse, plunging
through bushes, flying down hill-sides, with my neck at the mercy of my dear little Violette.
But she--she never slipped, she never faltered, as swift and as surefooted as if she knew that
her rider carried the fate of all Germany beneath the buttons of his pelisse. And I--I had
long borne the name of being the best horseman in the six brigades of light cavalry, but I
never rode as I rode then. My friend the Bart had told me of how they hunt the fox in England,
but the swiftest fox would have been captured by me that day. The wild pigeons which flew overhead
did not take a straighter course than Violette and I below. As an officer, I have always been
ready to sacrifice myself for my men, though the Emperor would not have thanked me for it,
for he had many men, but only one--well, cavalry leaders of the first class are rare.

But here I had an object which was indeed worth a sacrifice, and I thought no more of my life
than of the clods of earth that flew from my darling's heels.

We struck the road once more as the light was failing, and galloped into the little village
of Lobenstein. But we had hardly got upon the cobblestones when off came one of the mare's
shoes, and I had to lead her to the village smithy. His fire was low, and his day's work done,
so that it would be an hour at the least before I could hope to push on to Hof. Cursing at
the delay, I strode into the village inn and ordered a cold chicken and some wine to be served
for my dinner. It was but a few miles to Hof, and I had every hope that I might deliver my
papers to the Prince on that very night, and be on my way for France next morning with despatches
for the Emperor in my bosom. I will tell you now what befell me in the inn of Lobenstein.

The chicken had been served and the wine drawn, and I had turned upon both as a man may who
has ridden such a ride, when I was aware of a murmur and a scuffling in the hall outside my
door. At first I thought that it was some brawl between peasants in their cups, and I left
them to settle their own affairs. But of a sudden there broke from among the low, sullen growl
of the voices such a sound as would send Etienne Gerard leaping from his death-bed. It was
the whimpering cry of a woman in pain. Down clattered my knife and my fork, and in an instant
I was in the thick of the crowd which had gathered outside my door.

The heavy-cheeked landlord was there and his flaxen-haired wife, the two men from the stables,
a chambermaid, and two or three villagers. All of them, women and men, were flushed and angry,
while there in the centre of them, with pale cheeks and terror in her eyes, stood the loveliest
woman that ever a soldier would wish to look upon. With her queenly head thrown back, and a
touch of defiance mingled with her fear, she looked as she gazed round her like a creature
of a different race from the vile, coarse-featured crew who surrounded her. I had not taken
two steps from my door before she sprang to meet me, her hand resting upon my arm and her blue
eyes sparkling with joy and triumph.

'A French soldier and gentleman!' she cried. 'Now at last I am safe.'

'Yes, madam, you are safe,' said I, and I could not resist taking her hand in mine in order
that I might reassure her. 'You have only to command me,' I added, kissing the hand as a sign
that I meant what I was saying.

'I am Polish,' she cried; 'the Countess Palotta is my name. They abuse me because I love the
French. I do not know what they might have done to me had Heaven not sent you to my help.'

I kissed her hand again lest she should doubt my intentions. Then I turned upon the crew with
such an expression as I know how to assume. In an instant the hall was empty.

'Countess,' said I, 'you are now under my protection. You are faint, and a glass of wine is
necessary to restore you.' I offered her my arm and escorted her into my room, where she sat
by my side at the table and took the refreshment which I offered her.

How she blossomed out in my presence, this woman, like a flower before the sun! She lit up
the room with her beauty. She must have read my admiration in my eyes, and it seemed to me
that I also could see something of the sort in her own. Ah! my friends, I was no ordinary-looking
man when I was in my thirtieth year. In the whole light cavalry it would have been hard to
find a finer pair of whiskers. Murat's may have been a shade longer, but the best judges are
agreed that Murat's were a shade too long. And then I had a manner. Some women are to be approached
in one way and some in another, just as a siege is an affair of fascines and gabions in hard
weather and of trenches in soft. But the man who can mix daring with timidity, who can be outrageous
with an air of humility, and presumptuous with a tone of deference, that is the man whom mothers
have to fear. For myself, I felt that I was the guardian of this lonely lady, and knowing what
a dangerous man I had to deal with, I kept strict watch upon myself. Still, even a guardian
has his privileges, and I did not neglect them.

But her talk was as charming as her face. In a few words she explained that she was travelling
to Poland, and that her brother who had been her escort had fallen ill upon the way. She had
more than once met with ill-treatment from the country folk because she could not conceal her
good-will towards the French. Then turning from her own affairs she questioned me about the
army, and so came round to myself and my own exploits. They were familiar to her, she said,
for she knew several of Poniatowski's officers, and they had spoken of my doings. Yet she would
be glad to hear them from my own lips. Never have I had so delightful a conversation. Most
women make the mistake of talking rather too much about their own affairs, but this one listened
to my tales just as you are listening now, ever asking for more and more and more. The hours
slipped rapidly by, and it was with horror that I heard the village clock strike eleven, and
so learned that for four hours I had forgotten the Emperor's business.

'Pardon me, my dear lady,' I cried, springing to my feet, 'but I must go on instantly to Hof.'

She rose also, and looked at me with a pale, reproachful face. 'And me?' she said. 'What is
to become of me?'

'It is the Emperor's affair. I have already stayed far too long. My duty calls me, and I must go.'

'You must go? And I must be abandoned alone to these savages? Oh, why did I ever meet you?
Why did you ever teach me to rely upon your strength?' Her eyes glazed over, and in an instant
she was sobbing upon my bosom.

Here was a trying moment for a guardian! Here was a time when he had to keep a watch upon a
forward young officer. But I was equal to it. I smoothed her rich brown hair and whispered
such consolations as I could think of in her ear, with one arm round her, it is true, but that
was to hold her lest she should faint. She turned her tear-stained face to mine. 'Water,' she
whispered. 'For God's sake, water!'

I saw that in another moment she would be senseless. I laid the drooping head upon the sofa,
and then rushed furiously from the room, hunting from chamber to chamber for a carafe. It was
some minutes before I could get one and hurry back with it. You can imagine my feelings to
find the room empty and the lady gone.

Not only was she gone, but her cap and silver-mounted riding switch which had lain upon the
table were gone also. I rushed out and roared for the landlord. He knew nothing of the matter,
had never seen the woman before, and did not care if he never saw her again. Had the peasants
at the door seen anyone ride away? No, they had seen nobody. I searched here and searched there,
until at last I chanced to find myself in front of a mirror, where I stood with my eyes staring
and my jaw as far dropped as the chin-strap of my shako would allow.

Four buttons of my pelisse were open, and it did not need me to put my hand up to know that
my precious papers were gone. Oh! the depth of cunning that lurks in a woman's heart. She had
robbed me, this creature, robbed me as she clung to my breast. Even while I smoothed her hair,
and whispered kind words into her ear, her hands had been at work beneath my dolman. And here
I was, at the very last step of my journey, without the power of carrying out this mission
which had already deprived one good man of his life, and was likely to rob another one of his
credit. What would the Emperor say when he heard that I had lost his despatches? Would the
army believe it of Etienne Gerard? And when they heard that a woman's hand had coaxed them
from me, what laughter there would be at mess-table and at camp-fire! I could have rolled upon
the ground in my despair.

But one thing was certain--all this affair of the fracas in the hall and the persecution of
the so-called Countess was a piece of acting from the beginning. This villainous innkeeper
must be in the plot. From him I might learn who she was and where my papers had gone. I snatched
my sabre from the table and rushed out in search of him. But the scoundrel had guessed what
I would do, and had made his preparations for me. It was in the corner of the yard that I found
him, a blunderbuss in his hands and a mastiff held upon a leash by his son. The two stable-hands,
with pitchforks, stood upon either side, and the wife held a great lantern behind him, so as
to guide his aim.

'Ride away, sir, ride away!' he cried, with a crackling voice. 'Your horse is at the door,
and no one will meddle with you if you go your way; but if you come against us, you are alone
against three brave men.'

I had only the dog to fear, for the two forks and the blunderbuss were shaking about like branches
in a wind. Still, I considered that, though I might force an answer with my sword-point at
the throat of this fat rascal, still I should have no means of knowing whether that answer
was the truth. It would be a struggle, then, with much to lose and nothing certain to gain.
I looked them up and down, therefore, in a way that set their foolish weapons shaking worse
than ever, and then, throwing myself upon my mare, I galloped away with the shrill laughter
of the landlady jarring upon my ears.

I had already formed my resolution. Although I had lost my papers, I could make a very good
guess as to what their contents would be, and this I would say from my own lips to the Prince
of Saxe-Felstein, as though the Emperor had commissioned me to convey it in that way. It was
a bold stroke and a dangerous one, but if I went too far I could afterwards be disavowed. It
was that or nothing, and when all Germany hung on the balance the game should not be lost if
the nerve of one man could save it.

It was midnight when I rode into Hof, but every window was blazing, which was enough it itself,
in that sleepy country, to tell the ferment of excitement in which the people were. There was
hooting and jeering as I rode through the crowded streets, and once a stone sang past my head,
but I kept upon my way, neither slowing nor quickening my pace, until I came to the palace.
It was lit from base to battlement, and the dark shadows, coming and going against the yellow
glare, spoke of the turmoil within. For my part, I handed my mare to a groom at the gate, and
striding in I demanded, in such a voice as an ambassador should have, to see the Prince instantly,
upon business which would brook no delay.

The hall was dark, but I was conscious as I entered of a buzz of innumerable voices, which
hushed into silence as I loudly proclaimed my mission. Some great meeting was being held then--a
meeting which, as my instincts told me, was to decide this very question of war and peace.
It was possible that I might still be in time to turn the scale for the Emperor and for France.
As to the major-domo, he looked blackly at me, and showing me into a small ante-chamber he
left me. A minute later he returned to say that the Prince could not be disturbed at present,
but that the Princess would take my message.

The Princess! What use was there in giving it to her? Had I not been warned that she was German
in heart and soul, and that it was she who was turning her husband and her State against us?

'It is the Prince that I must see,' said I.

'Nay, it is the Princess,' said a voice at the door, and a woman swept into the chamber. 'Von
Rosen, you had best stay with us. Now, sir, what is it that you have to say to either Prince
or Princess of Saxe-Felstein?'

At the first sound of the voice I had sprung to my feet. At the first glance I had thrilled
with anger. Not twice in a lifetime does one meet that noble figure, that queenly head, and
those eyes as blue as the Garonne, and as chilling as her winter waters.

'Time presses, sir!' she cried, with an impatient tap of her foot. 'What have you to say to me?'

'What have I to say to you?' I cried. 'What can I say, save that you have taught me never to
trust a woman more? You have ruined and dishonoured me for ever.'

She looked with arched brows at her attendant.

'Is this the raving of fever, or does it come from some less innocent cause?' said she. 'Perhaps
a little blood-letting--'

'Ah, you can act!' I cried. 'You have shown me that already.'

'Do you mean that we have met before?'

'I mean that you have robbed me within the last two hours.'

'This is past all bearing,' she cried, with an admirable affectation of anger. 'You claim,
as I understand, to be an ambassador, but there are limits to the privileges which such an
office brings with it.'

'You brazen it admirably,' said I. 'Your Highness will not make a fool of me twice in one night.'
I sprang forward and, stooping down, caught up the hem of her dress. 'You would have done well
to change it after you had ridden so far and so fast,' said I.

It was like the dawn upon a snow-peak to see her ivory cheeks flush suddenly to crimson.

'Insolent!' she cried. 'Call the foresters and have him thrust from the palace'

'I will see the Prince first.'

'You will never see the Prince. Ah! Hold him, Von Rosen, hold him.'

She had forgotten the man with whom she had to deal--was it likely that I would wait until
they could bring their rascals? She had shown me her cards too soon. Her game was to stand
between me and her husband. Mine was to speak face to face with him at any cost. One spring
took me out of the chamber. In another I had crossed the hall. An instant later I had burst
into the great room from which the murmur of the meeting had come. At the far end I saw a figure
upon a high chair under a daïs. Beneath him was a line of high dignitaries, and then on every
side I saw vaguely the heads of a vast assembly. Into the centre of the room I strode, my sabre
clanking, my shako under my arm.

'I am the messenger of the Emperor,' I shouted. 'I bear his message to His Highness the Prince
of Saxe-Felstein.'

The man beneath the daïs raised his head, and I saw that his face was thin and wan, and that
his back was bowed as though some huge burden was balanced between his shoulders.

'Your name, sir?' he asked.

'Colonel Etienne Gerard, of the Third Hussars.'

Every face in the gathering was turned upon me, and I heard the rustle of the innumerable necks
and saw countless eyes without meeting one friendly one amongst them. The woman had swept past
me, and was whispering, with many shakes of her head and dartings of her hands, into the Prince's
ear. For my own part I threw out my chest and curled my moustache, glancing round in my own
debonair fashion at the assembly. They were men, all of them, professors from the college,
a sprinkling of their students, soldiers, gentlemen, artisans, all very silent and serious.
In one corner there sat a group of men in black, with riding-coats drawn over their shoulders.
They leaned their heads to each other, whispering under their breath, and with every movement
I caught the clank of their sabres or the clink of their spurs.

'The Emperor's private letter to me informs me that it is the Marquis Château St Arnaud who
is bearing his despatches,' said the Prince.

'The Marquis has been foully murdered,' I answered, and a buzz rose up from the people as I
spoke. Many heads were turned, I noticed, towards the dark men in the cloaks.

'Where are your papers?' asked the Prince.

'I have none.'

A fierce clamour rose instantly around me. 'He is a spy! He plays a part!' they cried. 'Hang
him!' roared a deep voice from the corner, and a dozen others took up the shout. For my part,
I drew out my handkerchief and nicked the dust from the fur of my pelisse. The Prince held
out his thin hands, and the tumult died away.

'Where, then, are your credentials, and what is your message?'

'My uniform is my credential, and my message is for your private ear.'

He passed his hand over his forehead with the gesture of a weak man who is at his wits' end
what to do. The Princess stood beside him with her hand upon his throne, and again whispered
in his ear.

'We are here in council together, some of my trusty subjects and myself,' said he. 'I have
no secrets from them, and whatever message the Emperor may send to me at such a time concerns
their interests no less than mine.'

There was a hum of applause at this, and every eye was turned once more upon me. My faith,
it was an awkward position in which I found myself, for it is one thing to address eight hundred
hussars, and another to speak to such an audience on such a subject. But I fixed my eyes upon
the Prince, and tried to say just what I should have said if we had been alone, shouting it
out, too, as though I had my regiment on parade.

'You have often expressed friendship for the Emperor,' I cried. 'It is now at last that this
friendship is about to be tried. If you will stand firm, he will reward you as only he can
reward. It is an easy thing for him to turn a Prince into a King and a province into a power.
His eyes are fixed upon you, and though you can do little to harm him, you can ruin yourself.
At this moment he is crossing the Rhine with two hundred thousand men. Every fortress in the
country is in his hands. He will be upon you in a week, and if you have played him false, God
help both you and your people. You think that he is weakened because a few of us got the chilblains
last winter. Look there!' I cried, pointing to a great star which blazed through the window
above the Prince's head. 'That is the Emperor's star. When it wanes, he will wane--but not before.'

You would have been proud of me, my friends, if you could have seen and heard me, for I clashed
my sabre as I spoke, and swung my dolman as though my regiment was picketed outside in the
courtyard. They listened to me in silence, but the back of the Prince bowed more and more as
though the burden which weighed upon it was greater than his strength. He looked round with
haggard eyes.

'We have heard a Frenchman speak for France,' said he. 'Let us have a German speak for Germany.'

The folk glanced at each other, and whispered to their neighbours. My speech, as I think, had
its effect, and no man wished to be the first to commit himself in the eyes of the Emperor.
The Princess looked round her with blazing eyes, and her clear voice broke the silence.

'Is a woman to give this Frenchman his answer?' she cried. 'Is it possible, then, that among
the night-riders of Lutzow there is none who can use his tongue as well as his sabre?'

Over went a table with a crash, and a young man had bounded upon one of the chairs. He had
the face of one inspired--pale, eager, with wild hawk eyes, and tangled hair. His sword hung
straight from his side, and his riding-boots were brown with mire.

'It is Korner!' the people cried. 'It is young Korner, the poet! Ah, he will sing, he will sing.'

And he sang! It was soft, at first, and dreamy, telling of old Germany, the mother of nations,
of the rich, warm plains, and the grey cities, and the fame of dead heroes. But then verse
after verse rang like a trumpet-call. It was of the Germany of now, the Germany which had been
taken unawares and overthrown, but which was up again, and snapping the bonds upon her giant
limbs. What was life that one should covet it? What was glorious death that one should shun
it? The mother, the great mother, was calling. Her sigh was in the night wind. She was crying
to her own children for help. Would they come? Would they come? Would they come?

Ah, that terrible song, the spirit face and the ringing voice! Where were I, and France, and
the Emperor? They did not shout, these people--they howled. They were up on the chairs and
the tables. They were raving, sobbing, the tears running down their faces. Korner had sprung
from the chair, and his comrades were round him with their sabres in the air. A flush had come
into the pale face of the Prince, and he rose from his throne.

'Colonel Gerard,' said he, 'you have heard the answer which you are to carry to your Emperor.
The die is cast, my children. Your Prince and you must stand or fall together.'

He bowed to show that all was over, and the people with a shout made for the door to carry
the tidings into the town. For my own part, I had done all that a brave man might, and so I
was not sorry to be carried out amid the stream. Why should I linger in the palace? I had had
my answer and must carry it, such as it was. I wished neither to see Hof nor its people again
until I entered it at the head of a vanguard. I turned from the throng, then, and walked silently
and sadly in the direction in which they had led the mare.

It was dark down there by the stables, and I was peering round for the hostler, when suddenly
my two arms were seized from behind. There were hands at my wrists and at my throat, and I
felt the cold muzzle of a pistol under my ear.

'Keep your lips closed, you French dog,' whispered a fierce voice. 'We have him, captain.'

'Have you the bridle?'

'Here it is.'

'Sling it over his head.'

I felt the cold coil of leather tighten round my neck. An hostler with a stable lantern had
come out and was gazing upon the scene. In its dim light I saw stern faces breaking everywhere
through the gloom, with the black caps and dark cloaks of the night-riders.

'What would you do with him, captain?' cried a voice.

'Hang him at the palace gate.'

'An ambassador?'

'An ambassador without papers.'

'But the Prince?'

'Tut, man, do you not see that the Prince will then be committed to our side? He will be beyond
all hope of forgiveness. At present he may swing round tomorrow as he has done before. He may
eat his words, but a dead hussar is more than he can explain.'

'No, no, Von Strelitz, we cannot do it,' said another voice.

'Can we not? I shall show you that!' and there came a jerk on the bridle which nearly pulled
me to the ground. At the same instant a sword flashed and the leather was cut through within
two inches of my neck.

'By Heaven, Korner, this is rank mutiny,' cried the captain. 'You may hang yourself before
you are through with it.'

'I have drawn my sword as a soldier and not as a brigand,' said the young poet. 'Blood may
dim its blade, but never dishonour. Comrades, will you stand by and see this gentleman mishandled?'

A dozen sabres flew from their sheaths, and it was evident that my friends and my foes were
about equally balanced. But the angry voices and the gleam of steel had brought the folk running
from all parts.

'The Princess!' they cried. 'The Princess is coming!'

And even as they spoke I saw her in front of us, her sweet face framed in the darkness. I had
cause to hate her, for she had cheated and befooled me, and yet it thrilled me then and thrills
me now to think that my arms have embraced her, and that I have felt the scent of her hair
in my nostrils. I know not whether she lies under her German earth, or whether she still lingers,
a grey-haired woman in her Castle of Hof, but she lives ever, young and lovely, in the heart
and memory of Etienne Gerard.

'For shame!' she cried, sweeping up to me, and tearing with her own hands the noose from my
neck. 'You are fighting in God's own quarrel, and yet you would begin with such a devil's deed
as this. This man is mine, and he who touches a hair of his head will answer for it to me.'

They were glad enough to slink off into the darkness before those scornful eyes. Then she turned
once more to me.

'You can follow me, Colonel Gerard,' she said. 'I have a word that I would speak to you.'

I walked behind her to the chamber into which I had originally been shown. I am certain that they enjoy
my ma, who was passion-personage.

Try before information, i see it was convicted on gossip. I could
be transpose of place, we was met.
 Round whisked my two dragoons and galloped for
their lives, with the moon gleaming on their brass helmets, while I trotted up to my friends
with no undue haste, for I would have them understand that though a hussar may fly, it is not
in his nature to fly very fast. Yet I fear that Violette's heaving flanks and foam-spattered
muzzle gave the lie to my careless bearing.

Who should be at the head of the troop but old Bouvet, whom I saved at Leipzig! When he saw
me his little pink eyes filled with tears, and, indeed, I could not but shed a few myself at
the sight of his joy. I told him of my mission, but he laughed when I said that I must pass
through Senlis.

'The enemy is there,' said he. 'You cannot go.'

'I prefer to go where the enemy is,' I answered.

'But why not go straight to Paris with your despatch? Why should you choose to pass through
the one place where you are almost sure to be taken or killed?'

'A soldier does not choose--he obeys,' said I, just as I had heard Napoleon say it.

Old Bouvet laughed in his wheezy way, until I had to give my moustachios a twirl and look him
up and down in a manner which brought him to reason.

'Well', said he, 'you had best come along with us, for we are all bound for Senlis. Our orders
are to reconnoitre the place. A squadron of Poniatowski's Polish Lancers are in front of us.
If you must ride through it, it is possible that we may be able to go with you.'

So away we went, jingling and clanking through the quiet night until we came up with the Poles--fine
old soldiers all of them, though a trifle heavy for their horses. It was a treat to see them,
for they could not have carried themselves better if they had belonged to my own brigade. We
rode together, until in the early morning we saw the lights of Senlis. A peasant was coming
along with a cart, and from him we learned how things were going there.

His information was certain, for his brother was the Mayor's coachman, and he had spoken with
him late the night before. There was a single squadron of Cossacks--or a polk, as they call
it in their frightful language--quartered upon the Mayor's house, which stands at the corner
of the market-place, and is the largest building in the town. A whole division of Prussion
infantry was encamped in the woods to the north, but only the Cossacks were in Senlis. Ah,
what a chance to avenge ourselves upon these barbarians, whose cruelty to our poor countryfolk
was the talk at every camp fire.

We were into the town like a torrent, hacked down the vedettes, rode over the guard, and were
smashing in the doors of the Mayor's house before they understood that there was a Frenchman
within twenty miles of them. We saw horrid heads at the windows--heads bearded to the temples,
with tangled hair and sheepskin caps, and silly, gaping mouths. 'Hourra! Hourra!' they shrieked,
and fired with their carbines, but our fellows were into the house and at their throats before
they had wiped the sleep out of their eyes. It was dreadful to see how the Poles flung themselves
upon them, like starving wolves upon a herd of fat bucks--for, as you know, the Poles have
a blood feud against the Cossacks. The most were killed in the upper rooms, whither they had
fled for shelter, and the blood was pouring down into the hall like rain from a roof. They
are terrible soldiers, these Poles, though I think they are a trifle heavy for their horses.
Man for man, they are as big as Kellerman's cuirassiers. Their equipment is, of course, much
lighter, since they are without the cuirass, back-plate, and helmet.

Well, it was at this point that I made an error--a very serious error it must be admitted.
Up to this moment I had carried out my mission in a manner which only my modesty prevents me
from describing as remarkable. But now I did that which an official would condemn and a soldier
excuse.

There is no doubt that the mare was spent, but still it is true that I might have galloped
on through Senlis and reached the country, where I should have had no enemy between me and
Paris. But what hussar can ride past a fight and never draw rein? It is to ask too much of
him. Besides, I thought that if Violette had an hour of rest I might have three hours the better
at the other end. Then on the top of it came those heads at the windows, with their sheepskin
hats and their barbarous cries. I sprang from my saddle, threw Violette's bridle over a rail-post,
and ran into the house with the rest. It is true that I was too late to be of service, and
that I was nearly wounded by a lance-thrust from one of these dying savages. Still, it is a
pity to miss even the smallest affair, for one never knows what opportunity for advancement
may present itself. I have seen more soldierly work in outpost skirmishes and little gallop-and-hack
affairs of the kind than in any of the Emperor's big battles.

When the house was cleared I took a bucket of water out for Violette, and our peasant guide
showed me where the good Mayor kept his fodder. My faith, but the little sweetheart was ready
for it. Then I sponged down her legs, and leaving her still tethered I went back into the house
to find a mouthful for myself, so that I should not need to halt again until I was in Paris.

And now I come to the part of my story which may seem singular to you, although I could tell
you at least ten things every bit as queer which have happened to me in my lifetime. You can
understand that, to a man who spends his life in scouting and vedette duties on the bloody
ground which lies between two great armies, there are many chances of strange experiences.
I'll tell you, however, exactly what occurred.

Old Bouvet was waiting in the passage when I entered, and he asked me whether we might not
crack a bottle of wine together. 'My faith, we must not be long,' said he. 'There are ten thousand
of Theilmann's Prussians in the woods up yonder.'

'Where is the wine?' I asked.

'Ah, you may trust two hussars to find where the wine is,' said he, and taking a candle in
his hand, he led the way down the stone stairs into the kitchen.

When we got there we found another door, which opened on to a winding stair with the cellar
at the bottom. The Cossacks had been there before us, as was easily seen by the broken bottles
littered all over it. However, the Mayor was a bon-vivant, and I do not wish to have a better
set of bins to pick from. Chambertin, Graves, Alicant, white wine and red, sparkling and still,
they lay in pyramids peeping coyly out of sawdust. Old Bouvet stood with his candle looking
here and peeping there, purring in his throat like a cat before a milk-pail. He had picked
upon a Burgundy at last, and had his hand outstretched to the bottle when there came a roar
of musketry from above us, a rush of feet, and such a yelping and screaming as I have never
listened to. The Prussians were upon us!

Bouvet is a brave man: I will say that for him. He flashed out his sword and away he clattered
up the stone steps, his spurs clinking as he ran. I followed him, but just as we came out into
the kitchen passage a tremendous shout told us that the house had been recaptured.

'It is all over,' I cried, grasping at Bouvet's sleeve.

'There is one more to die,' he shouted, and away he went like a madman up the second stair.
In effect, I should have gone to my death also had I been in his place, for he had done very
wrong in not throwing out his scouts to warn him if the Germans advanced upon him. For an instant
I was about to rush up with him, and then I bethought myself that, after all, I had my own
mission to think of, and that if I were taken the important letter of the Emperor would be
sacrificed. I let Bouvet die alone, therefore, and I went down into the cellar again, closing
the door behind me.

Well, it was not a very rosy prospect down there either. Bouvet had dropped the candle when
the alarm came, and I, pawing about in the darkness, could find nothing but broken bottles.
At last I came upon the candle, which had rolled under the curve of a cask, but, try as I would
with my tinderbox, I could not light it. The reason was that the wick had been wet in a puddle
of wine, so suspecting that this might be the case, I cut the end off with my sword. Then I
found that it lighted easily enough. But what to do I could not imagine. The scoundrels upstairs
were shouting themselves hoarse, several hundred of them from the sound, and it was clear that
some of them would soon want to moisten their throats. There would be an end to a dashing soldier,
and of the mission and of the medal. I thought of my mother and I thought of the Emperor. It
made me weep to think that the one would lose so excellent a son and the other the best light
cavalry officer he ever had since Lasalle's time. But presently I dashed the tears from my
eyes. 'Courage!' I cried, striking myself upon the chest. 'Courage, my brave boy. Is it possible
that one who has come safely from Moscow without so much as a frost-bite will die in a French
wine-cellar?' At the thought I was up on my feet and clutching at the letter in my tunic, for
the crackle of it gave me courage.

My first plan was to set fire to the house, in the hope of escaping in the confusion. My second
to get into an empty wine-cask. I was looking round to see if I could find one, when suddenly,
in the corner, I espied a little low door, painted of the same grey colour as the wall, so
that it was only a man with quick sight who would have noticed it. I pushed against it, and
at first I imagined that it was locked. Presently, however, it gave a little, and then I understood
that it was held by the pressure of something on the other side. I put my feet against a hogshead
of wine, and I gave such a push that the door flew open and I came down with a crash upon my
back, the candle flying out of my hands, so that I found myself in darkness once more. I picked
myself up and stared through the black archway into the gloom beyond.

There was a slight ray of light coming from some slit or grating. The dawn had broken outside,
and I could dimly see the long, curving sides of several huge casks, which made me think that
perhaps this was where the Mayor kept his reserves of wine while they were maturing. At any
rate, it seemed to be a safer hiding-place than the outer cellar, so gathering up my candle,
I was just closing the door behind me, when I suddenly saw something which filled me with amazement,
and even, I confess, with the smallest little touch of fear.

I have said that at the further end of the cellar there was a dim grey fan of light striking
downwards from somewhere near the roof. Well, as I peered through the darkness, I suddenly
saw a great, tall man skip into this belt of daylight, and then out again into the darkness
at the further end. My word, I gave such a start that my shako nearly broke its chin-strap!
It was only a glance, but, none the less, I had time to see that the fellow had a hairy Cossack
cap on his head, and that he was a great, long-legged, broad-shouldered brigand, with a sabre
at his waist. My faith, even Etienne Gerard was a little staggered at being left alone with
such a creature in the dark.

But only for a moment. 'Courage!' I thought. 'Am I not a hussar, a brigadier, too, at the age
of thirty-one, and the chosen messenger of the Emperor?' After all, this skulker had more cause
to be afraid of me than I of him. And then suddenly I understood that he was afraid--horribly
afraid. I could read it from his quick step and his bent shoulders as he ran among the barrels,
like a rat making for its hole. And, of course, it must have been he who had held the door
against me, and not some packing-case or wine-cask as I had imagined. He was the pursued then,
and I the pursuer. Aha, I felt my whiskers bristle as I advanced upon him through the darkness!
He would find that he had no chicken to deal with, this robber from the North. For the moment
I was magnificent.

At first I had feared to light my candle lest I should make a mark of myself, but now, after
cracking my shin over a box, and catching my spurs in some canvas, I thought the bolder course
the wiser. I lit it, therefore, and then I advanced with long strides, my sword in my hand.
'Come out, you rascal!' I cried. 'Nothing can save you. You will at last meet with your deserts.'

I held my candle high, and presently I caught a glimpse of the man's head staring at me over
a barrel. He had a gold chevron on his black cap, and the expression of his face told me in
an instant that he was an officer and a man of refinement.

'Monsieur,' he cried, in excellent French, 'I surrender myself on a promise of quarter. But
if I do not have your promise, I will then sell my life as dearly as I can.'

'Sir,' said I, 'a Frenchman knows how to treat an unfortunate enemy. Your life is safe.' With
that he handed his sword over the top of the barrel, and I bowed with the candle on my heart.
'Whom have I the honour of capturing?' I asked.

'I am the Count Boutkine, of the Emperor's own Don Cossacks,' said he. 'I came out with my
troop to reconnoitre Senlis, and as we found no sign of your people we determined to spend
the night here.'

'And would it be an indiscretion,' I asked, 'if I were to inquire how you came into the back
cellar?'

'Nothing more simple,' said he. 'It was our intention to start at early dawn. Feeling chilled
after dressing, I thought that a cup of wine would do me no harm, so I came down to see what
I could find. As I was rummaging about, the house was suddenly carried by assault so rapidly
that by the time I had climbed the stairs it was all over. It only remained for me to save
myself, so I came down here and hid myself in the back cellar, where you have found me.'

I thought of how old Bouvet had behaved under the same conditions, and the tears sprang to
my eyes as I contemplated the glory of France. Then I had to consider what I should do next.
It was clear that this Russian Count, being in the back cellar while we were in the front one,
had not heard the sounds which would have told him that the house was once again in the hands
of his own allies. If he should once understand this the tables would be turned, and I should
be his prisoner instead of he being mine. What was I to do? I was at my wits' end, when suddenly
there came to me an idea so brilliant that I could not but be amazed at my own invention.

'Count Boutkine,' said I, 'I find myself in a most difficult position.'

'And why?' he asked.

'Because I have promised you your life.'

His jaw dropped a little.

'You would not withdraw your promise?' he cried.

'If the worst comes to the worst I can die in your defence,' said I; 'but the difficulties
are great.'

'What is it, then?' he asked.

'I will be frank with you,' said I. 'You must know that our fellows, and especially the Poles,
are so incensed against the Cossacks that the mere sight of the uniform drives them mad. They
precipitate themselves instantly upon the wearer and tear him limb from limb. Even their officers
cannot restrain them.'

The Russian grew pale at my words and the way in which I said them.

'But this is terrible,' said he.

'Horrible!' said I. 'If we were to go up together at this moment I cannot promise how far I
could protect you.'

'I am in your hands,' he cried. 'What would you suggest that we should do? Would it not be
best that I should remain here?'

'That worst of all.'

'And why?'

'Because our fellows will ransack the house presently, and then you would be cut to pieces.
No, no, I must go and break it to them. But even then, when once they see that accursed uniform,
I do not know what may happen.'

'Should I then take the uniform off?'

'Excellent!' I cried. 'Hold, we have it! You will take your uniform off and put on mine. That
will make you sacred to every French soldier.'

'It is not the French I fear so much as the Poles.'

'But my uniform will be a safeguard against either.'

'How can I thank you?' he cried. 'But you--what are you to wear?'

'I will wear yours.'

'And perhaps fall a victim to your generosity?'

'It is my duty to take the risk,' I answered; 'but I have no fears. I will ascend in your uniform.
A hundred swords will be turned upon me. "Hold!" I will shout, "I am the Brigadier Gerard!"
Then they will see my face. They will know me. And I will tell them about you. Under the shield
of these clothes you will be sacred.'

His fingers trembled with eagerness as he tore off his tunic. His boots and breeches were much
like my own, so there was no need to change them, but I gave him my hussar jacket, my dolman,
my shako, my sword-belt, and my sabre-tasche, while I took in exchange his high sheepskin cap
with the gold chevron, his fur-trimmed coat, and his crooked sword. Be it well understood that
in changing the tunics I did not forget to change my thrice-precious letter also from my old
one to my new.

'With your leave,' said I, 'I shall now bind you to a barrel.'

He made a great fuss over this, but I have learned in my soldiering never to throw away chances,
and how could I tell that he might not, when my back was turned, see how the matter really
stood, and break in upon my plans? He was leaning against a barrel at the time, so I ran six
times round it with a rope, and then tied it with a big knot behind. If he wished to come upstairs
he would, at least, have to carry a thousand litres of good French wine for a knapsack. I then
shut the door of the back cellar behind me, so that he might not hear what was going forward,
and tossing the candle away I ascended the kitchen stair.

There were only about twenty steps, and yet, while I came up them, I seemed to have time to
think of everything that I had ever hoped to do. It was the same feeling that I had at Eylau
when I lay with my broken leg and saw the horse artillery galloping down upon me. Of course,
I knew that if I were taken I should be shot instantly as being disguised within the enemy's
lines. Still, it was a glorious death--in the direct service of the Emperor--and I reflected
that there could not be less than five lines, and perhaps seven, in the Moniteur about me.
Palaret had eight lines, and I am sure that he had not so fine a career.

When I made my way out into the hall, with all the nonchalance in my face and manner that I
could assume, the very first thing that I saw was Bouvet's dead body, with his legs drawn up
and a broken sword in his hand. I could see by the black smudge that he had been shot at close
quarters. I should have wished to salute as I went by, for he was a gallant man, but I feared
lest I should be seen, and so I passed on.

The front of the hall was full of Prussian infantry, who were knocking loopholes in the wall,
as though they expected that there might be yet another attack. Their officer, a little man,
was running about giving directions. They were all too busy to take much notice of me, but
another officer, who was standing by the door with a long pipe in his mouth, strode across
and clapped me on the shoulder, pointing to the dead bodies of our poor hussars, and saying
something which was meant for a jest, for his long beard opened and showed every fang in his
head. I laughed heartily also, and said the only Russian words that I knew. I learned them
from little Sophie, at Wilna, and they meant: 'If the night is fine we shall meet under the
oak tree, but if it rains we shall meet in the byre.' It was all the same to this German, however,
and I have no doubt that he gave me credit for saying something very witty indeed, for he roared
laughing, and slapped me on my shoulder again. I nodded to him and marched out of the hall-door
as coolly as if I were the commandant of the garrison.

There were a hundred horses tethered about outside, most of them belonging to the Poles and
hussars. Good little Violette was waiting with the others, and she whinnied when she saw me
coming towards her. But I would not mount her. No. I was much too cunning for that. On the
contrary, I chose the most shaggy little Cossack horse that I could see, and I sprang upon
it with as much assurance as though it had belonged to my father before me. It had a great
bag of plunder slung over its neck, and this I laid upon Violette's back, and led her along
beside me. Never have you seen such a picture of the Cossack returning from the foray. It was
superb.

Well, the town was full of Prussians by this time. They lined the side-walks and pointed me
out to each other, saying, as I could judge from their gestures, 'There goes one of those devils
of Cossacks. In this way I worked along until I was beyond the northern outskirt of the town.
I could see in the roadway two lancer vedettes with their black and white pennons, and I knew
that when I was once past these I should be a free man once more. I made my pony trot, therefore,
Violette rubbing her nose against my knee all the time, and looking up at me to ask how she
had deserved that this hairy doormat of a creature should be preferred to her. I was not more
than a hundred yards from the Uhlans when, suddenly, you can imagine my feelings when I saw
a real Cossack coming galloping along the road towards me.

Ah, my friend, you who read this, if you have any heart, you will feel for a man like me, who
had gone through so many dangers and trials, only at this very last moment to be confronted
with one which appeared to put an end to everything. I will confess that for a moment I lost
heart, and was inclined to throw myself down in my despair, and to cry out that I had been
betrayed. But, no; I was not beaten even now. I opened two buttons of my tunic so that I might
get easily at the Emperor's message, for it was my fixed determination when all hope was gone
to swallow the letter and then die sword in hand. Then I felt that my little, crooked sword
was loose in its sheath, and I trotted on to where the vedettes were waiting. They seemed inclined
to stop me, but I pointed to the other Cossack, who was still a couple of hundred yards off,
and they, understanding that I merely wished to meet him, let me pass with a salute.

I dug my spurs into my pony then, for if I were only far enough from the lancers I thought
I might manage the Cossack without much difficulty. He was an officer, a large, bearded man,
with a gold chevron in his cap, just the same as mine. As I advanced he unconsciously aided
me by pulling up his horse, so that I had a fine start of the vedettes. On I came for him,
and I could see wonder changing to suspicion in his brown eyes as he looked at me and at my
pony, and at my equipment. I do not know what it was that was wrong, but he saw something which
was as it should not be. He shouted out a question, and then when I gave no answer he pulled
out his sword. I was glad in my heart to see him do so, for I had always rather fight than
cut down an unsuspecting enemy. Now I made at him full tilt, and, parrying his cut, I got my
point in just under the fourth button of his tunic. Down he went, and the weight of him nearly
took me off my horse before I could disengage. I never glanced at him to see if he were living
or dead, for I sprang off my pony and on to Violette, with a shake of my bridle and a kiss
of my hand to the two Uhlans behind me. They galloped after me, shouting, but Violette had
had her rest, and was just as fresh as when she started. I took the first side road to the
west and then the first to the south, which would take me away from the enemy's country. On
we went and on, every stride taking me further from my foes and nearer to my friends. At last,
when I reached the end of a long stretch of road, and looking back from it could see no sign
of any pursuers, I understood that my troubles were over.

And it gave me a glow of happiness, as I rode, to think that I had done to the letter what
the Emperor had ordered. What would he say when he saw me? What could he say which would do
justice to the incredible way in which I had risen above every danger? He had ordered me to
go through Sermoise, Soissons, and Senlis, little dreaming that they were all three occupied
by the enemy. And yet I had done it. I had borne his letter in safety through each of these
towns. Hussars, dragoons, lancers, Cossacks, and infantry--I had run the gauntlet of all of
them, and had come out unharmed.

When I had got as far as Dammartin I caught a first glimpse of our own outposts. There was
a troop of dragoons in a field, and of course I could see from the horsehair crests that they
were French. I galloped towards them in order to ask them if all was safe between there and
Paris, and as I rode I felt such a pride at having won my way back to my friends again, that
I could not refrain from waving my sword in the air.

At this a young officer galloped out from among the dragoons, also brandishing his sword, and
it warmed my heart to think that he should come riding with such ardour and enthusiasm to greet
me. I made Violette caracole, and as we came together I brandished my sword more gallantly
than ever, but you can imagine my feelings when he suddenly made a cut at me which would certainly
have taken my head off if I had not fallen forward with my nose in Violette's mane. My faith,
it whistled just over my cap like an east wind. Of course, it came from this accursed Cossack
uniform which, in my excitement, I had forgotten all about, and this young dragoon had imagined
that I was some Russian champion who was challenging the French cavalry. My word, he was a
frightened man when he understood how near he had been to killing the celebrated Brigadier Gerard.

Well, the road was clear, and about three o'clock in the afternoon I was at St Denis, though
it took me a long two hours to get from there to Paris, for the road was blocked with commissariat
waggons and guns of the artillery reserve, which was going north to Marmont and Mortier. You
cannot conceive the excitement which my appearance in such a costume made in Paris, and when
I came to the Rue de Rivoli I should think I had a quarter of a mile of folk riding or running
behind me. Word had got about from the dragoons (two of whom had come with me), and everybody
knew about my adventures and how I had come by my uniform. It was a triumph--men shouting and
women waving their handkerchiefs and blowing kisses from the windows.

Although I am a man singularly free from conceit, still I must confess that, on this one occasion,
I could not restrain myself from showing that this reception gratified me. The Russian's coat
had hung very loose upon me, but now I threw out my chest until it was as tight as a sausage-skin.
And my little sweetheart of a mare tossed her mane and pawed with her front hoofs, frisking
her tail about as though she said, 'We've done it together this time. It is to us that commissions
should be intrusted.' When I kissed her between the nostrils as I dismounted at the gate of
the Tuileries, there was as much shouting as if a bulletin had been read from the Grand Army.

I was hardly in costume to visit a King; but, after all, if one has a soldierly figure one
can do without all that. I was shown up straight away to Joseph, whom I had often seen in Spain.
He seemed as stout, as quiet, and as amiable as ever. Talleyrand was in the room with him,
or I suppose I should call him the Duke of Benevento, but I confess that I like old names best.
He read my letter when Joseph Buonaparte handed it to him, and then he looked at me with the
strangest expression in those funny little, twinkling eyes of his.

'Were you the only messenger?' he asked.

'There was one other, sir,' said I. 'Major Charpentier, of the Horse Grenadiers.'

'He has not yet arrived,' said the King of Spain.

'If you had seen the legs of his horse, sire, you would not wonder at it,' I remarked.

'There may be other reasons,' said Talleyrand, and he gave that singular smile of his.

Well, they paid me a compliment or two, though they might have said a good deal more and yet
have said too little. I bowed myself out, and very glad I was to get away, for I hate a Court
as much as I love a camp. Away I went to my old friend Chaubert, in the Rue Miromesnil, and
there I got his hussar uniform, which fitted me very well. He and Lisette and I supped together
in his rooms, and all my dangers were forgotten. In the morning I found Violette ready for
another twenty-league stretch. It was my intention to return instantly to the Emperor's headquarters,
for I was, as you may well imagine, impatient to hear his words of praise, and to receive my
reward.

I need not say that I rode back by a safe route, for I had seen quite enough of Uhlans and
Cossacks. I passed through Meaux and Château Thierry, and so in the evening I arrived at Rheims,
where Napoleon was still lying. The bodies of our fellows and of St Prest's Russians had all
been buried, and I could see changes in the camp also. The soldiers looked better cared for;
some of the cavalry had received remounts, and everything was in excellent order. It was wonderful
what a good general can effect in a couple of days.

When I came to the headquarters I was shown straight into the Emperor's room. He was drinking
coffee at a writing-table, with a big plan drawn out on paper in front of him. Berthier and
Macdonald were leaning, one over each shoulder, and he was talking so quickly that I don't
believe that either of them could catch a half of what he was saying. But when his eyes fell
upon me he dropped the pen on to the chart, and he sprang up with a look in his pale face which
struck me cold.

'What the deuce are you doing here?' he shouted. When he was angry he had a voice like a peacock.

'I have the honour to report to you, sire,' said I, 'that I have delivered your despatch safely
to the King of Spain.'

'What!' he yelled, and his two eyes transfixed me like bayonets. Oh, those dreadful eyes, shifting
from grey to blue, like steel in the sunshine. I can see them now when I have a bad dream.

'What has become of Charpentier?' he asked.

'He is captured,' said Macdonald.

'By whom?'

'The Russians.'

'The Cossacks?'

'No, a single Cossack.'

'He gave himself up?'

'Without resistance.'

'He is an intelligent officer. You will see that the medal of honour is awarded to him.'

When I heard those words I had to rub my eyes to make sure that I was awake.

'As to you,' cried the Emperor, taking a step forward as if he would have struck me, 'you brain
of a hare, what do you think that you were sent upon this mission for? Do you conceive that
I would send a really important message by such a hand as yours, and through every village
which the enemy holds? How you came through them passes my comprehension; but if your fellow-messenger
had had but as little sense as you, my whole plan of campaign would have been ruined. Can you
not see, coglione, that this message contained false news, and that it was intended to deceive
the enemy whilst I put a very different scheme into execution?'

When I heard those cruel words and saw the angry, white face which glared at me, I had to hold
the back of a chair, for my mind was failing me and my knees would hardly bear me up. But then
I took courage as I reflected that I was an honourable gentleman, and that my whole life had
been spent in toiling for this man and for my beloved country.

'Sire,' said I, and the tears would trickle down my cheeks whilst I spoke, 'when you are dealing
with a man like me you would find it wiser to deal openly. Had I known that you had wished
the despatch to fall into the hands of the enemy, I would have seen that it came there. As
I believed that I was to guard it, I was prepared to sacrifice my life for it. I do not believe,
sire, that any man in the world ever met with more toils and perils than I have done in trying
to carry out what I thought was your will.'

I dashed the tears from my eyes as I spoke, and with such fire and spirit as I could command
I gave him an account of it all, of my dash through Soissons, my brush with the dragoons, my
adventure in Senlis, my rencontre with Count Boutkine in the cellar, my disguise, my meeting
with the Cossack officer, my flight, and how at the last moment I was nearly cut down by a
French dragoon. The Emperor, Berthier, and Macdonald listened with astonishment on their faces.
When I had finished Napoleon stepped forward and he pinched me by the ear.

'There, there!' said he. 'Forget anything which I may have said. I would have done better to
trust you. You may go.'

I turned to the door, and my hand was upon the handle, when the Emperor called upon me to stop.

'You will see,' said he, turning to the Duke of Tarentum, 'that Brigadier Gerard has the special
medal of honour, for I believe that if he has the thickest head he has also the stoutest heart
in my army.'

8. HOW THE BRIGADIER WAS TEMPTED BY THE DEVIL

The spring is at hand, my friends. I can see the little green spear-heads breaking out once
more upon the chestnut trees, and the cafe tables have all been moved into the sunshine. It
is more pleasant to sit there, and yet I do not wish to tell my little stories to the whole
town. You have heard my doings as a lieutenant, as a squadron officer, as a colonel, as the
chief of a brigade. But now I suddenly become something higher and more important. I become
history.

If you have read of those closing years of the life of the Emperor which were spent in the
Island of St Helena, you will remember that, again and again, he implored permission to send
out one single letter which should be unopened by those who held him. Many times he made this
request, and even went so far as to promise that he would provide for his own wants and cease
to be an expense to the British Government if it were granted to him. But his guardians knew
that he was a terrible man, this pale, fat gentleman in the straw hat, and they dared not grant
him what he asked. Many have wondered who it was to whom he could have had anything so secret
to say. Some have supposed that it was to his wife, and some that it was to his father-in-law;
some that it was to the Emperor Alexander, and some to Marshal Soult. What will you think of
me, my friends, when I tell you it was to me--to me, the Brigadier Gerard--that the Emperor
wished to write? Yes, humble as you see me, with only my 100 francs a month of half-pay between
me and hunger, it is none the less true that I was always in the Emperor's mind, and that he
would have given his left hand for five minutes' talk with me. I will tell you tonight how
this came about.

It was after the Battle of Fére-Champenoise where the conscripts in their blouses and their
sabots made such a fine stand, that we, the more long-headed of us, began to understand that
it was all over with us. Our reserve ammunition had been taken in the battle, and we were left
with silent guns and empty caissons. Our cavalry, too, was in a deplorable condition, and my
own brigade had been destroyed in the charge at Craonne. Then came the news that the enemy
had taken Paris, that the citizens had mounted the white cockade; and finally, most terrible
of all, that Marmont and his corps had gone over to the Bourbons. We looked at each other and
asked how many more of our generals were going to turn against us. Already there were Jourdan,
Marmont, Murat, Bernadotte, and Jomini--though nobody minded much about Jomini, for his pen
was always sharper than his sword. We had been ready to fight Europe, but it looked now as
though we were to fight Europe and half of France as well.

We had come to Fontainebleau by a long, forced march, and there we were assembled, the poor
remnants of us, the corps of Ney, the corps of my cousin Gerard, and the corps of Macdonald:
twenty-five thousand in all, with seven thousand of the guard. But we had our prestige, which
was worth fifty thousand, and our Emperor, who was worth fifty thousand more. He was always
among us, serene, smiling, confident, taking his snuff and playing with his little riding-whip.
Never in the days of his greatest victories have I admired him as much as I did during the
Campaign of France.

One evening I was with a few of my officers, drinking a glass of wine of Suresnes. I mention
that it was wine of Suresnes just to show you that times were not very good with us. Suddenly
I was disturbed by a message from Berthier that he wished to see me. When I speak of my old
comrades-in-arms, I will, with your permission, leave out all the fine foreign titles which
they had picked up during the wars. "i. Stand, sent, you have not, emperor, others." lord, who
was nevertheless, good, "her, wilton whom? I love her had further than anything in pouring
father! It thought i am sad; and obviously, that why can stand."

"nay, glance," i. "i see you have taken to shake." "Debts!" he of-- "debts! Do you think he talked
it was debts who had brought of i had in of i ordered my horses of he, thought, who recoil my
glance, i had shown of i of woman, of half-many-dozen-suckers?-- debts who had nothing to do with it.
Man, Wilton, it had been concerning nothing but word, i would not
have foment over; for when one has a word me with pouring of side'i
thought, law, kind, one had best do it, tenderness-like rattling.

Oh a word, i have other, Wilton, whom rode." "i stand he stand, Sherbrooke Macdonald sent of
Austria," i replied he was, "i sherbrooke i have rid myself deserving
of it dared.

I finally me talked freely, i function you was, had not brought of do so, you will but Man." "alas!
my word," me believe me believe i dared of-- "his least ought do nothing. He believe he, he. I
believe i did what was finally, and according to the devotion, i." "nay, nay, Had
brought for emperor," he replied Wilton, "you spoke me believe of
fits, who was always more than the words.

Emperor, service." "you however, wilton," he of Lord, "i at words and you are right. Even, hitherto;"
he was of formerly into thoughts of Emperor, he had not entered as
crossfire. Interview. Tenderness, spirits, wilton himself; enough
i showed his child

.
 It is evident that further resistance is useless, and that
it can only bring misery upon our country. I wish to ask you, therefore, whether you are prepared
to join me in laying hands upon the Emperor's person, and bringing the war to a conclusion
by delivering him over to the allies?'

I assure you that when I heard this infamous proposition put forward by the man who had been
the earliest friend of the Emperor, and who had received greater favours from him than any
of his followers, I could only stand and stare at him in amazement. For his part he tapped
his pen-handle against his teeth, and looked at me with a slanting head.

'Well?' he asked.

'I am a little deaf on one side,' said I, coldly. 'There are some things which I cannot hear.
I beg that you will permit me to return to my duties.'

'Nay, but you must not be headstrong,' rising up and laying his hand upon my shoulder. 'You
are aware that the Senate has declared against Napoleon, and that the Emperor Alexander refuses
to treat with him.'

'Sir,' I cried, with passion, 'I would have you know that I do not care the dregs of a wine-glass
for the Senate or for the Emperor Alexander either.'

'Then for what do you care?'

'For my own honour and for the service of my glorious master, the Emperor Napoleon.'

'That is all very well,' said Berthier, peevishly, shrugging his shoulders. 'Facts are facts,
and as men of the world, we must look them in the face. Are we to stand against the will of
the nation? Are we to have civil war on the top of all our misfortunes? And, besides, we are
thinning away. Every hour comes the news of fresh desertions. We have still time to make our
peace, and, indeed, to earn the highest regard, by giving up the Emperor.'

I shook so with passion that my sabre clattered against my thigh.

'Sir,' I cried, 'I never thought to have seen the day when a Marshal of France would have so
far degraded himself as to put forward such a proposal. I leave you to your own conscience;
but as for me, until I have the Emperor's own order, there shall always be the sword of Etienne
Gerard between his enemies and himself.'

I was so moved by my own words and by the fine position which I had taken up, that my voice
broke, and I could hardly refrain from tears. I should have liked the whole army to have seen
me as I stood with my head so proudly erect and my hand upon my heart proclaiming my devotion
to the Emperor in his adversity. It was one of the supreme moments of my life.

'Very good,' said Berthier, ringing a bell for the lackey. 'You will show the Chief of Brigade
Gerard into the salon.'

The footman led me into an inner room, where he desired me to be seated. For my own part, my
only desire was to get away, and I could not understand why they should wish to detain me.
When one has had no change of uniform during a whole winter's campaign, one does not feel at
home in a palace.

I had been there about a quarter of an hour when the footman opened the door again, and in
came Colonel Despienne. Good heavens, what a sight he was! His face was as white as a guardsman's
gaiters, his eyes projecting, the veins swollen upon his forehead, and every hair of his moustache
bristling like those of an angry cat. He was too angry to speak, and could only shake his hands
at the ceiling and make a gurgling in his throat. 'Parricide! Viper!' those were the words
that I could catch as he stamped up and down the room.

Of course it was evident to me that he had been subjected to the same infamous proposals as
I had, and that he had received them in the same spirit. His lips were sealed to me, as mine
were to him, by the promise which we had taken, but I contented myself with muttering 'Atrocious!
Unspeakable!'--so that he might know that I was in agreement with him.

Well, we were still there, he striding furiously up and down, and I seated in the corner, when
suddenly a most extraordinary uproar broke out in the room which we had just quitted. There
was a snarling, worrying growl, like that of a fierce dog which has got his grip. Then came
a crash and a voice calling for help. In we rushed, the two of us, and, my faith, we were none
too soon.

Old Tremeau and Berthier were rolling together upon the floor, with the table upon the top
of them. The Captain had one of his great, skinny yellow hands upon the Marshal's throat, and
already his face was lead-coloured, and his eyes were starting from their sockets. As to Tremeau,
he was beside himself, with foam upon the corners of his lips, and such a frantic expression
upon him that I am convinced, had we not loosened his iron grip, finger by finger, that it
would never have relaxed while the Marshal lived. His nails were white with the power of his grasp.

'I have been tempted by the devil!' he cried, as he staggered to his feet. 'Yes, I have been
tempted by the devil!'

As to Berthier, he could only lean against the wall, and pant for a couple of minutes, putting
his hands up to his throat and rolling his head about. Then, with an angry gesture, he turned
to the heavy blue curtain which hung behind his chair.

The curtain was torn to one side and the Emperor stepped out into the room. We sprang to the
salute, we three old soldiers, but it was all like a scene in a dream to us, and our eyes were
as far out as Berthier's had been. Napoleon was dressed in his green-coated chasseur uniform,
and he held his little, silver-headed switch in his hand. He looked at us each in turn, with
a smile upon his face--that frightful smile in which neither eyes nor brow joined--and each
in turn had, I believe, a pringling on his skin, for that was the effect which the Emperor's
gaze had upon most of us. Then he walked across to Berthier and put his hand upon his shoulder.

'You must not quarrel with blows, my dear Prince,' said he; 'they are your title to nobility.'
He spoke in that soft, caressing manner which he could assume. There was no one who could make
the French tongue sound so pretty as the Emperor, and no one who could make it more harsh and
terrible.

'I believe he would have killed me,' cried Berthier, still rolling his head about.

'Tut, tut! I should have come to your help had these officers not heard your cries. But I trust
that you are not really hurt!' He spoke with earnestness, for he was in truth very fond of
Berthier--more so than of any man, unless it were of poor Duroc.

Berthier laughed, though not with a very good grace.

'It is new for me to receive my injuries from French hands,' said he.

'And yet it was in the cause of France,' returned the Emperor. Then, turning to us, he took
old Tremeau by the ear. 'Ah, old grumbler,' said he, 'you were one of my Egyptian grenadiers,
were you not, and had your musket of honour at Marengo. I remember you very well, my good friend.
So the old fires are not yet extinguished! They still burn up when you think that your Emperor
is wronged. And you, Colonel Despienne, you would not even listen to the tempter. And you,
Gerard, your faithful sword is ever to be between me and my enemies. Well, well, I have had
some traitors about me, but now at last we are beginning to see who are the true men.'

You can fancy, my friends, the thrill of joy which it gave us when the greatest man in the
whole world spoke to us in this fashion. Tremeau shook until I thought he would have fallen,
and the tears ran down his gigantic moustache. If you had not seen it, you could never believe
the influence which the Emperor had upon those coarse-grained, savage old veterans.

'Well, my faithful friends,' said he, 'if you will follow me into this room, I will explain
to you the meaning of this little farce which we have been acting. I beg, Berthier, that you
will remain in this chamber, and so make sure that no one interrupts us.'

It was new for us to be doing business, with a Marshal of France as sentry at the door. However,
we followed the Emperor as we were ordered, and he led us into the recess of the window, gathering
us around him and sinking his voice as he addressed us.

'I have picked you out of the whole army,' said he, 'as being not only the most formidable
but also the most faithful of my soldiers. I was convinced that you were all three men who
would never waver in your fidelity to me. If I have ventured to put that fidelity to the proof,
and to watch you while attempts were at my orders made upon your honour, it was only because,
in the days when I have found the blackest treason amongst my own flesh and blood, it is necessary
that I should be doubly circumspect. Suffice it that I am well convinced now that I can rely
upon your valour.'

'To the death, sire!' cried Tremeau, and we both repeated it after him.

Napoleon drew us all yet a little closer to him, and sank his voice still lower.

'What I say to you now I have said to no one--not to my wife or my brothers; only to you. It
is all up with us, my friends. We have come to our last rally. The game is finished, and we
must make provision accordingly.'

My heart seemed to have changed to a nine-pounder ball as I listened to him. We had hoped against
hope, but now when he, the man who was always serene and who always had reserves--when he,
in that quiet, impassive voice of his, said that everything was over, we realized that the
clouds had shut for ever, and the last gleam gone. Tremeau snarled and gripped at his sabre,
Despienne ground his teeth, and for my own part I threw out my chest and clicked my heels to
show the Emperor that there were some spirits which could rise to adversity.

'My papers and my fortune must be secured,' whispered the Emperor. 'The whole course of the
future may depend upon my having them safe. They are our base for the next attempt--for I am
very sure that these poor Bourbons would find that my footstool is too large to make a throne
for them. Where am I to keep these precious things? My belongings will be searched--so will
the houses of my supporters. They must be secured and concealed by men whom I can trust with
that which is more precious to me than my life. Out of the whole of France, you are those whom
I have chosen for this sacred trust.

'In the first place, I will tell you what these papers are. You shall not say that I have made
you blind agents in the matter. They are the official proof of my divorce from Josephine, of
my legal marriage to Marie Louise, and of the birth of my son and heir, the King of Rome. If
we cannot prove each of these, the future claim of my family to the throne of France falls
to the ground. Then there are securities to the value of forty millions of francs--an immense
sum, my friends, but of no more value than this riding-switch when compared to the other papers
of which I have spoken. I tell you these things that you may realize the enormous importance
of the task which I am committing to your care. Listen, now, while I inform you where you are
to get these papers, and what you are to do with them.

'They were handed over to my trusty friend, the Countess Walewski, at Paris, this morning.
At five o'clock she starts for Fontainebleau in her blue berline. She should reach here between
half-past nine and ten. The papers will be concealed in the berline, in a hiding-place which
none know but herself. She has been warned that her carriage will be stopped outside the town
by three mounted officers, and she will hand the packet over to your care. You are the younger
man, Gerard, but you are of the senior grade. I confide to your care this amethyst ring, which
you will show the lady as a token of your mission, and which you will leave with her as a receipt
for her papers.

'Having received the packet, you will ride with it into the forest as far as the ruined dove-house--the
Colombier. It is possible that I may meet you there--but if it seems to me to be dangerous,
I will send my body-servant, Mustapha, whose directions you may take as being mine. There is
no roof to the Colombier, and tonight will be a full moon. At the right of the entrance you
will find three spades leaning against the wall. With these you will dig a hole three feet
deep in the north-eastern corner--that is, in the corner to the left of the door, and nearest
to Fontainebleau. Having buried the papers, you will replace the soil with great care, and
you will then report to me at the palace.'

These were the Emperor's directions, but given with an accuracy and minuteness of detail such
as no one but himself could put into an order. When he had finished, he made us swear to keep
his secret as long as he lived, and as long as the papers should remain buried. Again and again
he made us swear it before he dismissed us from his presence.

Colonel Despienne had quarters at the 'Sign of the Pheasant,' and it was there that we supped
together. We were all three men who had been trained to take the strangest turns of fortune
as part of our daily life and business, yet we were all flushed and moved by the extraordinary
interview which we had had, and by the thought of the great adventure which lay before us.
For my own part, it had been my fate three several times to take my orders from the lips of
the Emperor himself, but neither the incident of the Ajaccio murderers nor the famous ride
which I made to Paris appeared to offer such opportunities as this new and most intimate commission.

'If things go right with the Emperor,' said Despienne, 'we shall all live to be marshals yet.'

We drank with him to our future cocked hats and our bâtons.

 To whom should

yet be overtaken. With the three best mounts in my stables and----'

I did not wait to hear the end of the sentence. I was already clattering down the stairs. I
am sure that five minutes had not passed before I was galloping Violette out of the town with
the bridle of one of the Emperor's own Arab chargers in either hand. They wished me to take
three, but I should have never dared to look my Violette in the face again. I feel that the
spectacle must have been superb when I dashed up to my comrades and pulled the horses on to
their haunches in the moonlight.

'No one has passed?'

'No one.'

'Then they are on the Paris road. Quick! Up and after them!'

They did not take long, those good soldiers. In a flash they were upon the Emperor's horses,
and their own left masterless by the roadside. Then away we went upon our long chase, I in
the centre, Despienne upon my right, and Tremeau a little behind, for he was the heavier man.
Heavens, how we galloped! The twelve flying hoofs roared and roared along the hard, smooth
road. Poplars and moon, black bars and silver streaks, for mile after mile our course lay along
the same chequered track, with our shadows in front and our dust behind. We could hear the
rasping of bolts and the creaking of shutters from the cottages as we thundered past them,
but we were only three dark blurs upon the road by the time that the folk could look after
us. It was just striking midnight as we raced into Corbail; but an hostler with a bucket in
either hand was throwing his black shadow across the golden fan which was cast from the open
door of the inn.

'Three riders!' I gasped. 'Have they passed?'

'I have just been watering their horses,' said he. 'I should think they----'

'On, on, my friends!' and away we flew, striking fire from the cobblestones of the little town.
A gendarme tried to stop up, but his voice was drowned by our rattle and clatter. The houses
slid past, and we were out on the country road again, with a clear twenty miles between ourselves
and Paris. How could they escape us, with the finest horses in France behind them? Not one
of the three had turned a hair, but Violette was always a head and shoulders to the front.
She was going within herself too, and I knew by the spring of her that I had only to let her
stretch herself, and the Emperor's horses would see the colour of her tail.

'There they are!' cried Despienne.

'We have them!' growled Tremeau.

'On, comrades, on!' I shouted, once more.

A long stretch of white road lay before us in the moonlight. Far away down it we could see
three cavaliers, lying low upon their horses' necks. Every instant they grew larger and clearer
as we gained upon them. I could see quite plainly that the two upon either side were wrapped
in mantles and rode upon chestnut horses, whilst the man between them was dressed in a chasseur
uniform and mounted upon a grey. They were keeping abreast, but it was easy enough to see from
the way in which he gathered his legs for each spring that the centre horse was far the fresher
of the three. And the rider appeared to be the leader of the party, for we continually saw
the glint of his face in the moonshine as he looked back to measure the distance between us.
At first it was only a glimmer, then it was cut across with a moustache, and at last when we
began to feel their dust in our throats I could give a name to my man.

'Halt, Colonel de Montluc!' I shouted. 'Halt, in the Emperor's name!'

I had known him for years as a daring officer and an unprincipled rascal. Indeed, there was
a score between us, for he had shot my friend, Treville, at Warsaw, pulling his trigger, as
some said, a good second before the drop of the handkerchief.

Well, the words were hardly out of my mouth when his two comrades wheeled round and fired their
pistols at us. I heard Despienne give a terrible cry, and at the same instant both Tremeau
and I let drive at the same man. He fell forward with his hands swinging on each side of his
horse's neck. His comrade spurred on to Tremeau, sabre in hand, and I heard the crash which
comes when a strong cut is met by a stronger parry. For my own part I never turned my head,
but I touched Violette with the spur for the first time and flew after the leader. That he
should leave his comrades and fly was proof enough that I should leave mine and follow.

He had gained a couple of hundred paces, but the good little mare set that right before we
could have passed two milestones. It was in vain that he spurred and thrashed like a gunner
driver on a soft road. His hat flew off with his exertions, and his bald head gleamed in the
moonshine. But do what he might, he still heard the rattle of the hoofs growing louder and
louder behind him. I could not have been twenty yards from him, and the shadow head was touching
the shadow haunch, when he turned with a curse in his saddle and emptied both his pistols,
one after the other, into Violette.

I have been wounded myself so often that I have to stop and think before I can tell you the
exact number of times. I have been hit by musket balls, by pistol bullets, and by bursting
shells, besides being pierced by bayonet, lance, sabre, and finally by a brad-awl, which was
the most painful of any. Yet out of all these injuries I have never known the same deadly sickness
as came over me when I felt the poor, silent, patient creature, which I had come to love more
than anything in the world except my mother and the Emperor, reel and stagger beneath me. I
pulled my second pistol from my holster and fired point-blank between the fellow's broad shoulders.
He slashed his horse across the flank with his whip, and for a moment I thought that I had
missed him. But then on the green of his chasseur jacket I saw an ever-widening black smudge,
and he began to sway in his saddle, very slightly at first, but more and more with every bound,
until at last over he went, with his foot caught in the stirrup, and his shoulders thud-thud-thudding
along the road, until the drag was too much for the tired horse, and I closed my hand upon
the foam-spattered bridle-chain. As I pulled him up it eased the stirrup leather, and the spurred
heel clinked loudly as it fell.

'Your papers!' I cried, springing from my saddle. 'This instant!'

But even as I said, it, the huddle of the green body and the fantastic sprawl of the limbs
in the moonlight told me clearly enough that it was all over with him. [understand 1: some look,

 At the same instant I heard the sound of hoofs approaching me, and
there in the moonlight was the Emperor upon his white charger, dressed in his grey overcoat
and his three-cornered hat, just as I had seen him so often upon the field of battle.

'Well!' he cried, in the sharp, sergeant-major way of his. 'Where are my papers?'

I spurred forward and presented them without a word. He broke the ribbon and ran his eyes rapidly
over them. Then, as we sat our horses head to tail, he threw his left arm across me with his
hand upon my shoulder. Yes, my friends, simple as you see me, I have been embraced by my great
master.

'Gerard,' he cried, 'you are a marvel!'

I did not wish to contradict him, and it brought a flush of joy upon my cheeks to know that
he had done me justice at last.

'Where is the thief, Gerard?' he asked.

'Dead, sire.'

'You killed him?'

'He wounded my horse, sire, and would have escaped had I not shot him.'

'Did you recognize him?'

'De Montluc is his name, sire--a Colonel of Chasseurs.'

'Tut,' said the Emperor. 'We have got the poor pawn, but the hand which plays the game is still
out of our reach.' He sat in silent thought for a little, with his chin sunk upon his chest.
'Ah, Talleyrand, Talleyrand,' I heard him mutter, 'if I had been in your place and you in mine,
you would have crushed a viper when you held it under your heel. For five years I have known
you for what you are, and yet I have let you live to sting me. Never mind, my brave,' he continued,
turning to me, 'there will come a day of reckoning for everybody, and when it arrives, I promise
you that my friends will be remembered as well as my enemies.'

'Sire,' said I, for I had had time for thought as well as he, 'if your plans about these papers
have been carried to the ears of your enemies, I trust you do not think that it was owing to
any indiscretion upon the part of myself or of my comrades.'

'It would be hardly reasonable for me to do so,' he answered, 'seeing that this plot was hatched
in Paris, and that you only had your orders a few hours ago.'

'Then how----?'

'Enough,' he cried, sternly. 'You take an undue advantage of your position.'

That was always the way with the Emperor. He would chat with you as with a friend and a brother,
and then when he had wiled you into forgetting the gulf which lay between you, he would suddenly,
with a word or with a look, remind you that it was as impassable as ever. When I have fondled
my old hound until he has been encouraged to paw my knees, and I have then thrust him down
again, it has made me think of the Emperor and his ways.

He reined his horse round, and I followed him in silence and with a heavy heart. But when he
spoke again his words were enough to drive all thought of myself out of my mind.

'I could not sleep until I knew how you had fared,' said he. 'I have paid a price for my papers.
There are not so many of my old soldiers left that I can afford to lose two in one night.'

When he said 'two' it turned me cold.

'Colonel Despienne was shot, sire,' I stammered.

'And Captain Tremeau cut down. Had I been a few minutes earlier, I might have saved him. The
other escaped across the fields.'

I remembered that I had seen a horseman a moment before I had met the Emperor. He had taken
to the fields to avoid me, but if I had known, and Violette been unwounded, the old soldier
would not have gone unavenged. I was thinking sadly of his sword-play, and wondering whether
it was his stiffening wrist which had been fatal to him, when Napoleon spoke again.

'Yes, Brigadier,' said he, 'you are now the only man who will know where these papers are concealed.'

It must have been imagination, my friends, but for an instant I may confess that it seemed
to me that there was a tone in the Emperor's voice which was not altogether one of sorrow.
But the dark thought had hardly time to form itself in my mind before he let me see that I
was doing him an injustice.

'Yes, I have paid a price for my papers,' he said, and I heard them crackle as he put his hand
up to his bosom. 'No man has ever had more faithful servants--no man since the beginning of
the world.'

As he spoke we came upon the scene of the struggle. Colonel Despienne and the man whom we had
shot lay together some distance down the road, while their horses grazed contentedly beneath
the poplars. Captain Tremeau lay in front of us upon his back, with his arms and legs stretched
out, and his sabre broken short off in his hand. His tunic was open, and a huge blood-clot
hung like a dark handkerchief out of a slit in his white shirt. I could see the gleam of his
clenched teeth from under his immense moustache.

The Emperor sprang from his horse and bent down over the dead man.

'He was with me since Rivoli,' said he, sadly. 'He was one of my old grumblers in Egypt.'

And the voice brought the man back from the dead. I saw his eyelids shiver. He twitched his
arm, and moved the sword-hilt a few inches. He was trying to raise it in salute. Then the mouth
opened, and the hilt tinkled down on to the ground.

'May we all die as gallantly,' said the Emperor, as he rose, and from my heart I added 'Amen.'

There was a farm within fifty yards of where we were standing, and the farmer, roused from
his sleep by the clatter of hoofs and the cracking of pistols, had rushed out to the roadside.
We saw him now, dumb with fear and astonishment, staring open-eyed at the Emperor. It was to
him that we committed the care of the four dead men and of the horses also. For my own part,
I thought it best to leave Violette with him and to take De Montluc's grey with me, for he
could not refuse to give me back my own mare, whilst there might be difficulties about the
other. Besides, my little friend's wound had to be considered, and we had a long return ride
before us.

The Emperor did not at first talk much upon the way. Perhaps the deaths of Despienne and Tremeau
still weighed heavily upon his spirits. He was always a reserved man, and in those times, when
every hour brought him the news of some success of his enemies or defection of his friends,
one could not expect him to be a merry companion. Nevertheless, when I reflected that he was
carrying in his bosom those papers which he valued so highly, and which only a few hours ago
appeared to be for ever lost, and when I further thought that it was I, Etienne Gerard, who
had placed them there, I felt that I had deserved some little consideration. The same idea
may have occurred to him, for when we had at last left the Paris high road, and had entered
the forest, he began of his own accord to tell me that which I should have most liked to have
asked him.

'As to the papers,' said he, 'I have already told you that there is no one now, except you
and me, who knows where they are to be concealed. My Mameluke carried the spades to the pigeon-house,
but I have told him nothing. Our plans, however, for bringing the packet from Paris have been
formed since Monday. There were three in the secret, a woman and two men. The woman I would
trust with my life; which of the two men has betrayed us I do not know, but I think that I
may promise to find out.'

We were riding in the shadow of the trees at the time, and I could hear him slapping his riding-whip
against his boot, and taking pinch after pinch of snuff, as was his way when he was excited.

'You wonder, no doubt,' said he, after a pause, 'why these rascals did not stop the carriage
at Paris instead of at the entrance to Fontainebleau.'

In truth, the objection had not occurred to me, but I did not wish to appear to have less wits
than he gave me credit for, so I answered that it was indeed surprising.

'Had they done so they would have made a public scandal, and run a chance of missing their
end. Short of taking the berline to pieces, they could not have discovered the hiding-place.
He planned it well--he could always plan well--and he chose his agents well also. But mine
were the better.'

It is not for me to repeat to you, my friends, all that was said to me by the Emperor as we
walked our horses amid the black shadows and through the moon-silvered glades of the great
forest. Every word of it is impressed upon my memory, and before I pass away it is likely that
I will place it all upon paper, so that others may read it in the days to come. He spoke freely
of his past, and something also of his future; of the devotion of Macdonald, of the treason
of Marmont, of the little King of Rome, concerning whom he talked with as much tenderness as
any bourgeois father of a single child; and, finally, of his father-in-law, the Emperor of
Austria, who would, he thought, stand between his enemies and himself. For myself, I dared
not say a word, remembering how I had already brought a rebuke upon myself; but I rode by his
side, hardly able to believe that this was indeed the great Emperor, the man whose glance sent
a thrill through me, who was now pouring out his thoughts to me in short, eager sentences,
the words rattling and racing like the hoofs of a galloping squadron. It is possible that,
after the word-splittings and diplomacy of a Court, it was a relief to him to speak his mind
to a plain soldier like myself.

In this way the Emperor and I--even after years it sends a flush of pride into my cheeks to
be able to put those words together--the Emperor and I walked our horses through the Forest
of Fontainebleau, until we came at last to the Colombier. The three spades were propped against
the wall upon the right-hand side of the ruined door, and at the sight of them the tears sprang
to my eyes as I thought of the hands for which they were intended. The Emperor seized one and
I another.

'Quick!' said he. 'The dawn will be upon us before we get back to the palace.'

We dug the hole, and placing the papers in one of my pistol holsters to screen them from the
damp, we laid them at the bottom and covered them up. We then carefully removed all marks of
the ground having been disturbed, and we placed a large stone upon the top. I dare say that
since the Emperor was a young gunner, and helped to train his pieces against Toulon, he had
not worked so hard with his hands. He was mopping his forehead with his silk handkerchief long
before we had come to the end of our task.

The first grey cold light of morning was stealing through the tree trunks when we came out
together from the old pigeon-house. The Emperor laid his hand upon my shoulder as I stood ready
to help him to mount.

 Why, the papers that you have recovered for me.'

'I am really at a loss to know what your Majesty is talking about.'

He flushed with anger for a moment, and then he burst out laughing.

'Very good, Brigadier!' he cried. 'I begin to believe that you are as good a diplomatist as
you are a soldier, and I cannot say more than that.'

       *       *       *       *       *

So that was my strange adventure in which I found myself the friend and confident agent of
the Emperor. When he returned from Elba he refrained from digging up the papers until his position
should be secure, and they still remained in the corner of the old pigeon-house after his exile
to St Helena. It was at this time that he was desirous of getting them into the hands of his
own supporters, and for that purpose he wrote me, as I afterwards learned, three letters, all
of which were intercepted by his guardians. Finally, he offered to support himself and his
own establishment--which he might very easily have done out of the gigantic sum which belonged
to him--if they would only pass one of his letters unopened. This request was refused, and
so, up to his death in '21, the papers still remained where I have told you. How they came
to be dug up by Count Bertrand and myself, and who eventually obtained them, is a story which
I would tell you, were it not that the end has not yet come.

Some day you will hear of those papers, and you will see how, after he has been so long in
his grave, that great man can still set Europe shaking. When that day comes, you will think
of Etienne Gerard, and you will tell your children that you have heard the story from the lips
of the man who was the only one living of all who took part in that strange history--the man
who was tempted by Marshal Berthier, who led that wild pursuit upon the Paris road, who was
honoured by the embrace of the Emperor, and who rode with him by moonlight in the Forest of
Fontainebleau. The buds are bursting and the birds are calling, my friends. Many to my friends had passed
also, but he met his close supporter, Samuel Morley. Henson me made a trip of England flushed
of the career. He cried the acquaintance are really recovered of Soldier Thomas Fowell Buxton Hart,
R. C. L. Bevan, and Professor.
