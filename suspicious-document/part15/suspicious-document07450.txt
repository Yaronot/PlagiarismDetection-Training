because it is this the highest level of conjugal fidelity.

The 14 December 1858 was the election day. From then on until his death, Brater of continuously
Member has remained. This election was the first public recognition and a turning point for him.
Not as if the enmity of the other party would have decreased, but the friendship of the like-minded
people dare now out; He was no longer the Verfemte, whose handling avoided the Kluge, open advocacy
for and against him in the Chamber and increasing attention on the part of the opponents had him
