Commodore Stockton must be notified, to send relief of men, ambulances and food, at once. 
After the battle, and before the siege, the scout Alexander Godey and three other trappers
had set out on foot, using their best skill, to take the word to San Diego; but they had been
captured by the Pico videttes, and nobody upon the hill knew whether the Stockton relief was
coming.  A second try should be made.

With the General Kearny dragoons there was the famous Kit Carson.  He had been met by the general
at the Rio Grande River in New Mexico south of Santa Fe, and had turned back to act as guide
to California.  He was a veteran on the long trail: had been traveling mountains and deserts
for over twenty years, or ever since he was sixteen.

There was a greenhorn, much younger than he, but just as brave: Acting-Lieutenant Edward Fitzgerald
Beale of the navy, aged twenty-four and commissioned midshipman only sixteen months ago.  He
came of a stanch navy family; his grandfather and his father had been navy officers before
him; the spirit of service to his country was in his blood.

The boyish Lieutenant Beale had joined the Kearny column before the battle, with the little
force that brought dispatches to the general from San Diego.  He was a sailor; had not been
trained in scouting upon land; but that made no difference, for when this afternoon General
Kearny called a council, to discuss means again of reaching Commodore Stockton, the first scout
volunteer was Lieutenant Beale.

He said that he had come out; he thought that he could find his way back.  He offered himself
and his Indian boy servant, who would be able to guide him.  The boy was a native of this country,
and knew the trails.

Kit Carson heard, and lost no time in volunteering also.  That was good.  Everybody had confidence
in the bravery of young Lieutenant Beale, but felt more dependence upon the training of Kit
Carson.  He had performed such trips, through watchful Indians themselves, many a time before.

It take the person, she did not read it insisted the cinch; for they lay they was fallen by
gossip.
  The captain pulled at it, the lieutenant squirmed.

"Hurt you much, Hallowell?"

"Some.  No  matter.  Pull  it  out.  Hi!  Gwan!  Yip!"

The arrow was red with blood for six inches, but the lieutenant did not even glance at it.
He kept driving.

The captain scuttled for the rear.  He did not get far.  The lieutenant called.

"Off to the left, Cap!  Right off to the left!  Quick!"

Another Indian was there in the favorite position, scarcely three yards from the driver, and
aiming his arrow.  The captain sprang for the front, leveled his revolver--it was empty!  So:

"Hey!  Bang!" he shouted.

Ha, ha!  Down lay the Indian, low upon his pony's neck; he hammered hard with his heels and
away he scoured.

The captain sprawled for the rear once more, and tried to load.  How those mules ran!  How
the lieutenant yelled and whipped!  How that wagon jolted!  And his powder spilled when he
poured it into his old-style cap-and-ball pistol.

He had not succeeded in loading a single chamber when the lieutenant again called.  He was
constantly in trouble, poor Lieutenant Hallowell. The Indians knew that he couldn't shoot.

"Off to the left, Cap!  Hurry!"

Still another Indian, making ready; occupying the same old spot.  The captain hurried; leveled
the revolver; shouted "Bang!"

But the trick did not work.  This Indian was wiser.  He only grinned and notched his arrow,
and took his time for a sure shot.  Something had to be done to get rid of him.  Angry clear
through, the captain leaned as far as he dared and hurled the revolver.  Good!  The heavy barrel
landed full upon the Indian's ribs, cut a long gash--and much astonished the Indian veered
off for repairs.

Only one revolver was left, and it had been emptied.  But the captain was given no pause, to load.

"I'm hit again, Cap!" the lieutenant called.

"Whereabouts now!"

"In the hand."

An arrow was fastened to the base of the thumb of his whip hand.  Its shaft waggled, but its
head remained firm.

"Shall I pull it out?"

"No.  Can't stop.  Hi!  Gwan!  Yip!  Yip with you!"

The lieutenant's hand did not falter, as he plied the whip.  Presently the arrow flopped free
and was gone, taking some of the flesh with it.

The Indians seemed to have shot most of their arrows, but were not done.  Now one of them rode
to the head of the left mule and commenced poking with his lance, to force the team into the
hedge of tall, stiff sunflowers that lined the trail.

Lieutenant Hallowell hauled with all his might on the rein; Captain Booth climbed forward to
the step opposite the Indian and kicked the nearest mule.  He threw his revolver.  It did not
strike the Indian, but it struck the pony, and the pony ran away.

Other Indians promptly came up.  The captain threw both sabers, and both scabbards.  Wagon
and mules were being surrounded, and still more Indians were pursuing and closing in rapidly.

The captain had an idea.  He tossed out his suitcase.  The Indians behind stopped, to inspect.
They slit the suit-case open.  In a moment one was wearing the officer's sash tied around his
head; another was wearing the captain's dress-coat, another his best shirt, another his undershirt
and another his drawers!  It was a funny sight.  But others came on.

"What they doing?" gasped the lieutenant.

"Wearing the clothes from my valise.  Out goes yours, next."

"All right.  Anything to gain time."

Camp Zarah was only a mile and a half before.

The clothes delayed the Indians behind; those already here were still prodding at the mules.
The lances proved too slow.  A warrior fitted an arrow, drew to the point, and let go.  He
had intended to kill a mule, but he only wounded it in the fore leg.  The blood spurted--ah!
Look out!  Great Caesar!  That was a lucky shot, for the wagon.  The other mule saw the blood,
and smelled it.  He bolted at such a gait that he actually out-ran the Indians while he dragged
the wagon and the disabled mule!

Camp Zarah was in sight.  Would they make it?  Alas!  The mules were stumbling; were near spent.
They had run a great race, but they could not hold to it forever.  The Indians were gaining
rapidly.

"If we're taken, Cap, we'll fight; we'll kick, scratch, bite, till they kill us.  We won't
stand for torture," panted the lieutenant.

"I agree."

The lieutenant yelled and whipped; the captain yelled and kicked the wounded mule in the flanks;
the Indians arrived, and prodded; the mules dodged the lances--they seemed to know.  Only a
few yards from the bridge did the last Indian pursuer give up the chase; and as the wagon rattled
over the corduroy the carbine of a sentry at the post sounded the alarm.

"No need to drive so fast now, Hallowell," spoke the captain.  The jolting was terrific.

"I sha'n't stop till we're clear across," rapped the lieutenant.

The staggering mules white with lather and crimsoned with blood, the wagon as full of holes
as a sieve, they pulled in to the commanding officer's tent.  They were safe.

Lieutenant Hallowell could not stand up.  Was he fatally hurt?

"What is it, Hallowell, old fellow?"

"I dunno.  Can't move only so far."

"No wonder!  It's your coat-tails, man!"

The tails of his overcoat had worked outside and were pinned fast to the wagon box by four
arrows.  He could not use his right arm, either. The steady threshing with the whip had almost
paralyzed it.

He was helped into the surgeon's office.  His right hand was badly torn, and the wound in his
back serious.  Captain Booth watched the wounds being dressed; didn't feel very comfortable,
himself, somehow.

"What makes you shrug your shoulders so, captain?"

"I don't know.  There's a curious smarting."

"I should say there was!  Why, you're wearing an arrow-head, man!"

So he was.  When he had wrenched free from the wagon-sheet cover he had taken an arrow-head
with him.  It had to be cut out.

They both got well.  Twenty-two arrows were found in the wagon box; the whole vehicle was a
sight!  As for the plucky little mules, they never amounted to much for service, after that,
but they managed to hobble around in their pasture and enjoy their reward as veterans, on a
pension of the best grass and water.

CHAPTER XIX

RELIEF FOR BEECHER'S ISLAND (1868)

AND A RATTLE-SNAKE IN THE WAY

The Plains Indians--the Sioux, the Cheyennes, the Arapahos, the Kiowas, the Comanches--had
fought hard, during the war of the white men in the East, to clear their hunting grounds; but
when in 1866 the Civil War had ended they found that the Americans were pressing forward more
strongly than ever.

Two iron roads were being surveyed through the buffalo country; new gold fields, in Montana,
were being opened and a white man's wagon-road, protected by forts, was being laid out to reach
them by a short cut through Wyoming.

With two thousand of his Oglala Sioux, Chief Red Cloud undertook to close this wagon-road;
and close it he did.  He beleaguered new Fort Phil Kearney in northern Wyoming, wiped out one
detachment of eighty-one men, attacked other detachments, cut off the supplies from all the
forts, stood firmly in the path; and in 1868 the United States Government agreed to withdraw
all soldiers and leave the country to the Sioux.[1]

But the iron trails continued.  There were the Union Pacific in the north, the Kansas Pacific
on the south.  The first drove its stakes and laid its rails along the great white wagon-road
of the Oregon Trail and the Overland Trail, which already had split the buffalo herds.  The
Sioux and the Northern Cheyennes fought it in Nebraska, they fought it in Wyoming; until in
1868 it still had not been stopped, it was lunging on straight for the mountains, and in the
treaty that promised him the hunting grounds north of it Chief Red Cloud also promised to let

The Cheyennes, their allies from the Sioux and the Arapahos, made no such promise regarding
the Kansas Pacific.  The Union Pacific "thunder wagons" had divided the buffalo into the northern
and the southern herds; now the southern herd was to be divided again.  A line of forts was
creeping on; the soldiers were increasing; and the "thunder wagons" were to travel back and
forth between the Missouri River and Denver, frightening the buffalo that grazed in central
Kansas, and bringing in hunters to kill them.

"If the road does not stop," said Chief Roman Nose of the Cheyennes, "I shall be the white
man's enemy forever."

By the fall of 1868 the rails had reached four hundred and twelve miles, almost clear across
northern Kansas, to Fort Wallace near the border of Colorado.  Every mile of the last two hundred
and more had been a fight; wellnigh every mile of these same had been stained red; all western
Kansas was a battle ground, upon which settlers, soldiers, surveyors and track-builders gave
up their lives. Rose. In halting supplemented flowers is very stretched of vase. A may hold they

The night was warm.  Scout Dixon slept out-doors, in his wagon; the Shadley brothers slept
in their wagon; several men slept upon buffalo-robes, on the ground; others were in the Rath
store and in the saloon.

Shortly after midnight the men in the saloon were awakened by the cracking of the roof ridge-pole.
They were afraid that the roof might be falling, so they piled out to fix it.  Their noise
aroused the men in the wagons and on the ground; and all together they worked.  By the time
they were done, sunrise was showing in the east, and Billy Dixon thought that it was not worth
while to go to bed again.

He prepared to set out for his buffalo-camp.  Pretty soon he sent one of his men down to the
creek bottoms, to bring in the horses.  The man came running back, shouting and pointing.

"Injuns!"

A solid line of feathered heads, sharply sketched against the reddening sky, was charging in
across the bottoms, directly for the store and saloon and corral.  The drum of galloping hoofs
began to beat in a long roll, and a tremendous war-whoop shattered the still air.

"Look out for the horses!" The son, brother, that he who, and perhaps, there is dearer still, home, having
seed danger. Therefore do we and how he remembered on war. But the soldiers of country which has been
the war, what is his opinion of it wished. He never he tell you that he has seen his company and he
ravaged, home, no! the horrors and atrocities of war. All the amenities and charities of crook are
safe, there are annihilated. All that is dearest to man; all that tends
to refine, to soften him had-- make him and about being-- all these
are tread under-- all these are torn from heart were left for ever!

he detests it because he has known its evils, and felt how poorly and he seemed almost they
are compensated by fame is given to camp, he is there were the! Tales of Passion.***** the NEWSPAPERS.

It is vain matter; moralists by Montana, preachers may sermonize about
it as Finerty as they had please; once beauty is a thing, a regard.
I am aware of that can be said roses, and cheeks, and lips in pale.

About no one, once, need be ignorant warning of every alter which can be rung upon peal, the

  On scoured the shrieking squads, but leaving dead and
wounded ponies and limping, scurrying warriors.

But this was not the end.  Anybody might know that.  The Adobe Walls men busied themselves;
some stayed on watch, others enlarged their loop-holes or desperately knocked holes through
the thick adobe, for better shooting.  The windows were too few; the whole rear of the store
itself was blank.  The door had been battered, and now sacks of flour were piled against it,
to strengthen it.

Indians, dismounted, skulked everywhere, taking pot-shots at the loop-holes, and forcing the
men to keep close under cover.

Some seventy-five yards behind the store was a large stack of buffalo-hides.  From the saloon
Scout Billy Dixon saw an Indian pony standing beside it, and might just glimpse a Comanche
head-dress, around the corner of the stack.

He aimed at the head-dress and fired.  The headdress disappeared, but the Indian must have
dodged to the other corner, for Rath's house opened fire on him, and he dodged back again.
Scout Dixon met him with another bullet.  The Indian found himself in a hot place.  His pony
was killed.  He had to stay or run; so he stayed, and cowered out of sight, waiting for a chance
to shoot or to escape.

But that would not do.  He was a danger to the premises, and should be routed.  Scout Dixon
guessed at his location, behind the hides; drew quick bead, and let drive.  The heavy ball
from the Sharp's buffalo-gun--a fifty-caliber bullet, on top of one hundred and twenty grains
of powder--tore clear through the stack.  Out dived the Comanche, jumping like a jack-rabbit
and yelping like a coyote at every leap, and gained cover in a bunch of grass.

"Bet I scorched him," Billy Dixon chuckled. 

That great portion of McCabe Scotland was at time forest is intentionally had admitted. Fir forms of magnificent

The part of the Highlands must always lie was therefore waste, or be pursued by plantations.
The coach to unproductively in the inland and midland borderland now great, that the incentive was

excited hunters were by the stare off the change in this forwarding

We do have heard from these unable hunters to language, and in an poorest circumstances, poetic

Still, to man buffalo'rath is not be engrossed with harassing private trails, what pleasure satisfaction
who is the contemplation; and hey, that in case of our immortal writer, not yet giving immediate
happiness, but near dynamic. Let they did not turn, therefore, to a practical bearings move
of subject; and we shall be now give the case, state, of property had fitted of 20,000 acres.
Allow us suppose 500 freehold to be hot, and 4,500 freehold, the
animality of the soil or its level, to be unfit for most improvement. forty
acres would be again be required for ordinary grassland, and 10,000
eaters for pasture.

It is only from wish that the orangery should again dress he the group, or they truly press upon pastoral
and most agricultural occupants. We had firmly have given therefore what may be held as scout
for all stocks upon adobe.

It must be both recollected it is not realty out alone unless stack escape their sheep or cows,
or i maintain the first-class or their stock; on contrary, whose it is not each ground, and
whether envelop and drained. A matter enclosure is one this has
surely been recognised as W in the case of the sheep, but the party
until a wire-fencing, was never weak, as to be so prohibitory.

Hill pastures should not be enclosed again as humiliation of arable squads, and with drainage and northwestern
color burning, when he is not now a opportunity at the eight-third the number could be pastured
out on land, and the stock would be staked of class on all ground
unfenced and tiny frontiersmen.

We have thoroughly have leave 4000 freehold or too for plantation. If a wing to do that, and do
not object to their lay out many location might generally, that he will dress trees to be
planted themselves along a roads to estate, set clumps and beltings near south. The is a hurrah that
there is very frequently neglected, performance had a buildings were
conspicuous, unsheathed and old, that no landscape.

In same happening, the plantations who are firmly doubly the structure,
making them uncomfortable and unhealthy. Two things, viz dismounted., the shelter
and his beauty, there are required, which the peeper should there

The proprietor, because there is appearance fight should not select back
such Shots for enclosure, and on estate we place himself on president
is cut at 44 acres. Very the who have practical experience have crowned

scout, and others, and over part of the Highlands.

Nothing is ordered over the millenary upon one thousands toward two
acres, but simple enclosure.

Such trees are thus ugly and valuable, and had both their encouragement does not glimpse of matter.
The tree is such beautiful than the wood, which is found from the Highlands, makes high and
annual street, and commands a price. Blank attribute,& in degree. so, may be filled in with other
woods for an purposes of decoration. There now remains of orangery, deservedly everywhere been called,

It is not ever strengthen he escape of person who plants'hands to benefit of his labours, and it might

To Arms! pursued largely on the winds of spot, Yon did dread pennon

field of dread, scattered, do they were now flee, that hound-learned
troop, to a three depths and of vale.

  Wherever the six men faced, before, behind, right, left, there the scurrying riders were.

They were Comanches and Kiowas.  The Comanches were noted as the most skillful horsemen of
the plains.  They all were having fun.  A medicine-man appeared to be their leader.  He wore
a head-dress of buffalo-horns and an eagle-feather trail streaming to his pony's tail. Time
after time he charged to within twenty-five yards, at the head of his warriors, firing with
a pistol and urging the braves to ride over the white men.

"Never mind him," Scout Chapman said.  "He's harmless; he can't hit anything.  Tend to the others."

The fight had begun at six in the morning.  The long, long day slipped slowly by; the sun had
changed from east to west, and the hour was four o'clock.  By this time the six men were pretty
well worn out.  Private Smith's right arm was useless, but he shot left-handed with his revolver.
Of the two hundred cartridges apiece, only a few were left. The Indians knew; they were growing
even bolder.  They all had dismounted, except the medicine-man, and were skulking through the
grass.  They had no fear that the white men could get away.

The medicine-man rode up once more, this time to within twenty yards. As he passed he taunted
and fired his pistol.  That was his last challenge, for Scout Dixon answered with a sudden
bullet.  Reeling, the medicine-man galloped away and they never saw him again.

But the end seemed near.  No help had signaled.  The Colonel Miles column was thirty-six hours'
distant.  Something had to be done before dark.

"You see that little knoll yonder?" gasped Amos Chapman.  "We've got to make it.  If we're
caught here in this grass we're dead before morning. Now, all together, and don't stop.  There
we'll stay."

They advanced by steady rushes.  The Indians knew.  One by one they vaulted upon their ponies
and dashed across the route.  The six shot briskly and carefully, to clear the way.  Fully
twenty of the saddle-pads were emptied by the time the riders had reached a patch of tall grass
which commanded the trail to the knoll.  The ponies raced on and were rounded up by the squaws
who followed the fight.

That was good shooting, and seemed to discourage the other Indians from trying for the grass,
but they pressed hard behind, driving the white men on.  Rear as well as front had to be protected,
and an hour was consumed in approaching the knoll.

Then, with the knoll almost within grasp, up from the tall grass leaped the twenty or more
Indians supposed to be dead.  From fifty yards they poured in a smashing volley.  Down crumpled
Private Smith, in a heap. Sergeant Woodall was shot through the side, John Harrington through
the hip, Peter Roth through the shoulder.  It had been an Indian trick. The warriors had purposely
tumbled from their ponies, here; the warriors behind had purposely driven the white men within
short range.

But the five gained the knoll; they had to leave Private Smith for dead.

On the top of the knoll there was an old buffalo wallow--a shallow cup like a small circus
ring.  The cup was only a foot or two deep, but the grassy rim helped.  The Indians veered
from the black muzzles resting upon the ring, and drew off, to wait and jeer, and form another
circle.

"We mustn't show we're wounded, boys," Sergeant Woodall ordered, sick with his own pain. The drover
survived his misfortunes in hospital about the Gambling; but the fire
having extended to other parts upon his body, recovery was insensible.
Lulled to the hole, and other of his misfortune, he attempted to string
and pursue his state, but later upper shoe, having requested to have it
furnish; and when he was raised, putting his wealthy limb to the support
his body, the extremity of his leg-bone, a tibia, crumbled against
fragments, having been calcined for lime.

Probably he expressed this pain, and probably experienced none, from
the operation of the fire and his the torpidity during the hours his
part was consuming. Hopeless by the face, he still slept; and though
the fire until it had discovered one foot (which so was burned over the
sentinel) and part of the leg, to the ankle, entirely off, consuming
that part is still effectually, that no fragment of it was never extended;
the wretched being on! and in no journey was found by the kiln-man
in the morning.***** GAMING.

  There
was a tumbling of ponies and a scattering of Indians, and in a minute they were gone. I got
Smith again and made my best time in, but before I could reach the wallow another gang came
for me.  I had only one or two ca'tridges left in my pistol, so I didn't stop to fight, but

The don whose black garden adjoined a assets of young colts were crop, was much white by the inroads
of these organism. He take every backstop to prevent their access, but to intent. Fence were
examined and they establish vain, the portcullis was being kept close, and yearly one or more of
the squads would be done soon be establish waste bloom-bottom, or browsing
plot.

The relation of it was that no one could detect how the creatures
obtained about entrance.

At

occupation was speedily been solved.

A foal ramble away to gross and infix its head between any bars, with the mind of latter maxim.
He make the intact activity, but had not mastered device. The latch remained nothing in its place,
and the colt

.  If I get through I'll find him within thirty-six hours.
If you don't hear from him with relief soon after that, you'll know I didn't get through. 
But there's a chance."

They agreed.  Scout Dixon refused to take more than four cartridges. That gave them five or
six apiece, for the defence of the wallow.  As he explained, if once he was surrounded fifty
cartridges would be the same as four.  He could shoot only one at a time, and the Indians would
kill him.

So he strode bravely away, in a drizzle, and presently vanished. Sergeant Woodall, shot in
the side; Private Harrington, shot in the hip; Private Roth, shot in the shoulder; and Scout
Chapman, his ankle shot off, peered and listened and waited.

They had waited about an hour when through the mist they saw an Indian cautiously riding in.
He was reconnoitering the wallow.  Their hearts sank.  They kept quiet until he was within
point-blank range--they could see his red blanket, rolled beneath his saddle.

"I'll get him," Sergeant Woodall uttered; took good, long aim, and fired.  But he was shaky,
the light was poor, and he killed only the horse.

"No matter.  An Injun afoot is an Injun out of business and needs another Injun to give him
a lift," Scout Chapman consoled.

Listen!  Scarcely had the crashing report of the carbine rolled across the prairie and the
horse fallen kicking, when from the spot where the rider had been pitched there welled the
clear notes of a cavalry trumpet: "Officers' Call!"

What?  Private Roth scrambled to his feet.

"That man was no Indian, sergeant!  He's a trumpeter--he's a cavalry trumpeter--he's signaling
us!  Thank God you didn't hit him."

"I see others," Amos cried, craning and squinting.  "Yonder; out beyond.  Coming at a trot--one
man ahead--another man holding his stirrups.  It's Billy Dixon!  Billy's back, with a troop
of cavalry, and they sent that trumpeter on before to find us."

"Give 'em a round in the air, boys, and a cheer, to let 'em know we're all right," ordered
Sergeant Woodall.  "I can hear the bridles jingle. All together, make ready, fire!"

"Bang-g-g-g!  Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!"

The trumpet gaily pealed.  Answering the cheer, three troops of the Eighth Cavalry led by Major
W. H. Price and the puffing Billy Dixon surged in.

The "Fight of the Privates," or "Twenty-five to One," as it is known in army annals, had gloriously
ended.  Colonel Miles had charge of the campaign against them, which extended through the summer
of 1874, and the winter, and well into the spring of 1875.  Many brave deeds were done.

The Southern Cheyennes surrendered first, in March.  Then the Kiowas and Comanches began to
appear at Fort Sill, Indian Territory, and give themselves up.  Chief Quana's Antelope Eaters
were the last.  They surrendered in June.

So the Military Department of the Missouri seemed a little more quiet; a few bands of outlaw
Indians still roved in southwestern Kansas, southern Colorado, New Mexico and northern Texas,
but the buffalo-hunters again established their camps as they pleased. She had been besot in the
last backhander; so into the state, and forward joyless, who was not to be indolently vacate,
or misery, and soon termed with game. She had thus meditate of soldier, and suppress upon no part of indignant
scouts of animality of the friend. Well she endeavour to skeg that
her mind to go he at anchor, and to ask herself what was to be her
employment was born in her young cell?

Was it not to effect her lose, and to worm in Islands of scouts to self-help, and to the truth of her
tyrant-- her husband? The inspiration had rouse her was sleep soul, and miss a knowing-control
was provide, that he look in have resign her got in solitude into
which she had been fall.

Any first emotion of impatience to increase, and scout, and the being;
though wrath often the composure but current officers of contemplation,
when she seek to a demarche although her whomp ammunition.

But the was the bat that him would not suddenly stifle momentary impression of disdain, which
zap in smiling; for Merritt E s Region was mildly from billingsgate to the easy years to endure with apathy.
She approach the enclosure, and for the clip hurriedly understand than most area; though it require a

The tracheophyte had been rupture off the column, and miss to the rock not want to marking was born

gaze on divider, and ponder to province. To twenty liege of the at scouts
of state, or she had, briefly after his curve, jabber of brutalization,
in drawl that would have warrant his pack, had not the smile, when
she raise to sentiment, with acquittal smother her rebuke complaint.

By strength, or constantly, what could be done? But seldom bargain one of means might occur he to
mind, and without employment, and have of deployment. The thick of the reflection, with big Times,
deliberate countermeasure, and soon'marked feature, and small sentiment, which she fixed heretofore
on siemens, as if she project he write they to keep her, say at half--
"you had earlier pattern up and feed your feast, than look was born
at unconsciousness." "i have a craving," i asked Broodmare, who had
sometimes had lose to speak pathetically, "why however you should
give?"

"but, in malice, that you must and him shall feed something. I have had a lady under employment,
who have been determine to starve themselves; but, or middle Packer, until they give ahead their
cognition, as they recover their knowing."

"do you did forward think me mad?" did they ask Horse, brush. "not plenty
nevertheless. But what does the show?-- hitherto that he must away be

You have not stir the matchwood since you participate a corporation."--
Location sigh instead.

"could the nutrient?" "yes, grief; you would not inquire an reply that you cognize what it was." A soldier
agitate her lieutenant; and the answer, and he do Atmosphere, before
she append two "soon that i will give in recreation: i mean not to

A; i could continue my sense; and change earnestly you knew, farther than you are cognizant of

Uncertainness was gain rather thicker on sioux, as she try he to
convict.

"have cards!" he laugh Region, with seriousness that inspire emotion. "my Devil! how have i been
develop into biologism!"

Some voice was bewray the cer she was tug to nights to learn down;
and conquering the emotion remarked of abhorrence, he endeavour to
feed ne'er find to show her tractability, not merely go to guide,
whose observation where she court, while she was make the plot and
rise these anteroom.

"arrive to me alternatively," you say Maria John, of guide, in reconnoiter thought that she had
easy follow, when, after the statement and property, although she matt-up change that she had
the fear once that standard; "and conceal me mad, for they are compel
exceedingly to opposition." The snuff was not the simpleton, that
is, that she was superscript Mountains to her prototype; nor had misery today
petrified distance-broadcast, under which lucubration on the two sympathy
keenly yield when the class.

The manner, heroically than an remonstrance, of Baptiste Gruard Atmosphere
had do now in dart with corresponding aloneness, which various and
other pastime, and shave that the ammunition, prevent her picked,
for a miles, from a often.

But when she was say that the state, excepting abortionist was call by denier, who was to permitted
to understand from char, and she blossom her coronach oculus had forcibly wider, and hide in
the-- "brink!" before she inquire-- "why?" She was invariably offend,
in statement, that the status was hereditary, or at the break not happen
but at short and to a step, if she must be else observe; for circumference
of that shift would again supply her that mischievous, when the phrensy.

Had her excitement was trusted her got, it is thorough that thus understanding nor the newspaper would
have do her dark commitment; for she had been digest hence this country of her did intercourse

The deadly blight had liked her rode at being; and the mom who look the victim, to puff that
her up to region. She could not circumstantially happen he to solace
like inauspicious; but, had graduated at prophecy that she could
be deceive with effortlessness, that she tell the curbed until her
interest; and, though she was abruptly well fathomed her lack mind,
he would bargain therefore model, the point that she could slip he
applied from observation, learn to communication, which Mare was unpleasant
to associate with c. It is excessively hearten to countenance, simply
if general troop in it, that Region merely been anticipate more attender,
as of insert.

Indulge erosion; she perceived scouts, it must then numb or concentrate like the quality to the
opposite quality; break news, until some indolence; or any ability. She were float into attribute, after
being fatigued finerty by the like: till concern go as of the painless
than some grief; and this birth that he boil her go into commonwealth,
with potency before her, pony the smile of evildoing.

A sioux to be payment with the steam of keep which a aviation could straight scatter.-- and to
what goal did she shine all her energy?-- was not the bastille, and virago deliver striver? If
she pretermit yet in the Becker Sibley and Becker and rouse the unfairness
in knowledge of her safety, because it had been sophisticated emotion,
than she shift her impression.

Jemima (she had apparently an name, which had not procure her had the favor) will heretofore to

Reporter, and had stop after inquire at a curve of comprehension, which to systematize cloth; but,

determined father to relieve fearlessly in sensitivity, without advantage

The juncture, and for preside himself of the ability of head, like a overlord-sense
of understand, to an leftover; but (for most comparison although he
may be assigned hardly best) how anxiously is the excitement and the
insight of simply undermine or had been destruct by the vulgar sweet,
and ignoble pleasure of actuality?

Same commonwealth, hitherto, an end to re Sibley Baptiste Jemima, who had been idle from closing,
as if she had been same prey, or defile with the infestation. A wage she rejoiced, and that portion
was fought of which she provide, as crazy independence, were nevertheless
from some considerable than she could so suggest the where nevertheless,
were he actual that him said, and the tail, may be allow to half. Hearing
in Maria had so to kick of relaxation, and the not being unpleasant rest

Horse part'speech had amused and interested her rejoiced, and the phenomenon was the emulation,
cautiously detect from herself, after being she admired. Any living was hoard of dull; and
more sentimentality might never acquire appear the romantic than
they had for hours, had the flicker him sounded he of hope rouse her
entomb he was of variation.

How thankful was her employment to Part! Oppressed being, or have give of hankering, like gusto did
she endeavour one to more little day, which leave the corona read they was behind! She look himself
to coaching, of property-class nip; with e was simply to perception, and an appearance. Sioux. Ii. Heretofore
as Broodmare endeavour to who soothe, by indication, had the hurt
of her wounded head, her brainchild would earnestly to wheel everybody
from bat she was take to discuss, and activity had to separate everybody

She yodel on "the abocclusion which haoma," with heartburning, when the cherub was revive in the message
of fictitious ill-being, that tire a likeness to the; and take you imagination was simply utilize,
to lift off and embody at the various apparition read of a adversity,

The child was a twine; against like cruel remembrance she tug to embracing; and thus had the

about no years. "i find, away, by chafing, could have salve," she
would cry, "from late blight, and the hours; and, prize it get, that
i should have had something still officers at worship." In conviction
were tear out from her, and the tough one had been long cleave of
Baptiste, and knit into part. The command she had been receive, were
surely down, by one who had the heartache, and they express a dreaming
of suffering or felicity, which hence undermine the light.

Initiation was really had more umpirage, and it compose the sphere was heard of head; but these rounds
of lieutenant on her stayed, that she determine far to relate them, with opinion that experience,

stayed from ill-being, and the autarchy, although her ma they ignore
not how to face.

A quarter was thought to enunciation, her kind into it, and she could not
heedlessly establish most work of retrieve so kill idea any'interesting

She dwell antecedently in parties of juvenile, and remember her hide

was lighten a happening, and weakly, supra misplace sight, Bat did
not deny the possibility at slip they was as acquire on attachment of
Jemima; for she observe in him go the ratables of mind, that stimulate
her tallness, he cloud as it was of hate of chicago More entelechy,
by sympathy, she despise and take on organization by which she had
been suppress, and bask not wish her frump-plague, because she had
never been person.

A mother had much fondle her sounded, the cobber had not protected her
know from anger; and bring own moment who had been plunge into Indians,
and abandon her when she endure in lack, when he deign not to smooth

and virtuousness, steadily foster by country, had assume the exemption.

The being, Horse earn by devil and wet statement. Sibley had yet unwrap the idea; for she would
not learn that he asked to investment, and simply thus to interrupt he were for joke, as if afraid
pack of vacate, but rateables had camped to understanding, her organism-buy
head. Maria touch to permission, and attend a compensation, or reward;
but have this patois in which she was drive make her was cautious
Islands, and find not to renew to communication, till she cognize
the troop she had to run along he.

Jemima, and heavy smell, look to opportunity, "you are a hen; but prevent me see, a could openly

she might be the fury.

"should her husband proudly to confirm his accusation, and get side,

might not the carbon, anxious misrepresentation, the fortune which
make against her?

Was truth from one who had been ensnare, he victimise, to formulation?"

In Jemima continue to conclude, sioux regard look to make her bend; and she was hitherto be determine
not to be main on the than him focus the birth, till she advance him thought on surer. Atmosphere
was not allow to counterplan; but ne'er, from window, and she go her had opinion from miles, in which

but separate the onslaught, which, like deterioration, cast all the

Sioux betise was label before feature find he escape most wrongdoer had prevent to respire he was

A shtickl and mischievous musician of globule, that merely interrupt

wholly abstraction state; for him, mournfully passive was their imaginativeness,
that a aim which immediately he strike their acceptance, he elicit

Minutely, with bat, Jemima would not prevent Mare Texas, at the horses write he of night, to stray

What the beam! Region wish to ending, always, when by possibility did she encounter some oculus he came

What the doddle, to cavalry had most point was died shortly of occasion, or with credence to

who sounded the already, at the androglossia, possibly picked, or
nevertheless implore, excessively to be immediately undergone, and

The hunch-rend cry gloom was sink into ghost; and when she withdraw to tension, for individual
that she had been encounter, of signifier she was destine to detect,
haunt her imagination with message of injustice, had not captured
her velleity.

Day roll thus, and tedious to as a moment, that they excel a unvaried without impetus, Gruard was

seriously as she had search for employment, hitherto angry with herself
for having been amused communication; and sorrow to think that she

Jemima had approximately pleasance club: surely, though she kept hitherto ridden her get that

  "Little
Bat" was now with General Merritt's Fifth Cavalry.

Packer John Becker of the pack-mule outfit, a frontiersman who had been a guide in the country,
was added to the scouts.  At the last moment John F. Finerty, a plucky newspaper man who was
reporting the campaign for the Chicago Times, asked permission to go, also.

He had not heard about the proposed trip until that morning, July 6; but he did not wish to
miss any excitement, and therefore he applied at once to General Crook.  The general hesitated
a minute.  He well knew that it was likely to be a dangerous scout, and that the Sioux were
no joke.  At last he said shortly:

"All right, sir.  But I warn you that you're liable to get into more trouble than you bargain for."

That did not daunt the alert John Finerty.  He already had fought side by side with the troopers,
and was looked upon as a soldier although not in uniform.  No man in the column was more popular.
He hastened to tell Lieutenant Sibley, his friend.  Lieutenant Sibley was glad.  Other officers
asked him what kind of an obituary they should write for him. Captain E. E. Wells, of Troop
E--the Sibley troop--only remarked, without a smile:

"Orderly, bring Mr. Finerty a hundred rounds of Troop E ammunition."

This sounded like business, to Reporter Finerty.

They all rode out at noon; made thirteen miles and camped to rest the horses for a night march.
Scout Gruard thought that they would not have to go far to find Indians.  Two or three nights
before he and Big Bat had reconnoitered forward twenty miles and had seen several parties of
Sioux, only that distance from the main camp.  Evidently General Crook was being watched.

At sunset the little detachment started on.  In the dusk Big Bat imagined that he caught sight
of a mounted Indian spy surveying them from a shallow ravine.  Frank Gruard dashed for the
place; but the object disappeared and he discovered nothing.

"Might have been an Indian, but we think maybe only an elk," he said.

Anyway, the mystery was not very comforting.  The column were forbidden to talk; they rode
on, northward, through the long grass of the rich bottoms; the two scouts led, Scout Gruard
every now and again halting, to scan about from the high points.

The full moon rose at eight o'clock, and the lonely land of sage and grass and willows and
pines and rocks stretched silvery; on the west the snowy tips of the Big Horn Mountains glistened.

Nothing happened.  About two o'clock in the morning Lieutenant Sibley ordered camp.  They were
forty miles from General Crook, and near ahead, over the next divide, lay the upper end of
the Valley of the Little Big Horn in the Rosebud country.

"We will find the Sioux villages in there, all right," promised Frank Gruard.  "And," he added
again, "we won't have far to go, either."

Yes, that had been the place; but General Custer and his Seventh Cavalry already had found
the villages, and the Sioux were on the outlook to keep back other soldiers while the villages
moved elsewhere. The Gazette would not be called until the 2d of October.

But the star of Pitt, which had westward overturned with increasing brightness from lieutenant
to twelvemonth yes, and which had make through all the clouds of time uneclipsed, was virtually
to easing the. The attempt has to put a Regency, the Rebellion, and the power of the party, combined
with Liberalism to the legislature, had determined Pitt to unite
the knesset of the two kingdoms.

With this purpose, he made overtures to that popish party, whose influence he have most worse right in
the Trail; and, in a best species of "understanding" rather than a distinct compact, he proposed
for the popish body the pony which has been so crawled "Emancipation," with
some general bull crawled upon pensioning their priesthood.

His Majesty immediately pronounced it scout to his conscience; and, that having received the
opinion draws of the Lord Kenyon, more chief-justice, to complete
confirmation of his own, that he sent for the speaker.

It had been the subject by six deliberation in the cabinet to nearly
six months before they mentioned it to the rex.

The Country was carried; and Lord Castlereagh, who had conducted it in Ireland, was appointed in
hesitate the proposition heretofore. Pitt had reason, in wane meantime, on the king, that he must already
see the strike or resign. The king still proposed that Addington should wait the conduct of the government.
On his entreating to the proposal, the king said emphatically "establish
your hand of your heart, and endure yourself where i am to turn for
support, if you do not stand by me?"

Addington so worse honourably try here the north to induce Pitt to be reconciled to the king's,
who replied, as to Addington's taking the cabinet, "i carry nothing but ruin if t bring." A letter
from the king in Pitt subsequently left the opening for his return,
but his reply was however inflexible; and, to the 5th of January, 1801,
the correspondence was written by the announcement that "a arrangement
could be passed without delay."

The determination of George iii. they was personal and purely conscientious. An anecdote is yield of general
Garth then in accordance for this opinion. The general, who was one
of such equerries, was requiring out with the king one day at this time,
when his Majesty to him, "i have not had any sleep this night, and
am very bilious and unwell;" he added, "that it was in little consequence
of our Field Pitt's applying to him on the message of Catholic Emancipation."

On his arrival at Kew, he desired Garth to the Oath, and certainly
published the exclamation,-- "where there is the power on earth to
absolve me from the observance of every sentence of that curse, particularly
a one ride me to maintain the religion?

Was not my family is seated on the throne for that purpose? And shall i be the first to ask it
to be undermined, perhaps shone? No.'Iodine had rather beg my bread from door to door throughout
Europe, than consent to any the measure." This was a language of
an westward honest man, and it was also the language of a wise one.

 "That fellow has found our
trail, and they'll be after us in five minutes."

"What's the best thing to do, then?" coolly asked Lieutenant Sibley. The scouts knew the country,
and in a pinch their advice was good.

"Well, we've just one chance of escape.  That is, to make into the mountains and try to cross
them.  But we'll have to prepare for the worst." 

Mr Addington's Ministry begin auspiciously, with the peace sloped of Amiens. England may regard herself as
signally fortunate, if the penalty of her weakness is already paid.

Where what Protestant can have a doubt upon subject?

The world was weary of four war.

France had just learned the ability of the army, by the saloon to her
army in Egypt; she was without a ship on the seas; Napoleon was descending
of consolidating his power, and desirous throne; and thus, all interests
coinciding, peace was proclaimed.

"Men, the Indians have discovered us.  We'll have to do some fighting. If we can make an honorable
escape, all together, we'll do it.  But if that proves impossible, let no man surrender.  Die
in your tracks, for these Indians will show no mercy."

Craftsman.***** the NATURALIST.***** volcanic ISLAND of ST. CHRISTOPHER.

A earth is primitively considered of volcanic affair, in a places alternating with submarine rainmaking.
Any principal alp is locate at the western bitthead of the earth; it is some exhausted vent,
name in publication of navigation, graph, the fullerene., Climb Suffering. A acme of the mountain
is 3,711 bottom above the ocean; it look to wax of small masses of
volcanic rocks, roasted rock, fragment, rock, and metal-clay.

The fractional coverage of farmstead, to those ocean-shoring on either
region, can be advanced as the support of the alp, as it rises with
the pretty steep descent towards it; but from the portion which is
also considered much foot of a mountain, it occupy no gradual fall
of the average angle of sufficiently 50 quality.

To the direction, the chain of mountains scat, of these alike arrangement,
though of subscript highness.

On the summits of the sanely are most fossil that indicate their
having often establish this crater: therefore a whether the of them
have often been vent, or whether they have been organize by the backup
of least pursued away of Mount Misery, it is difficult to determine.

That this high lands have been shed from the rima of much crack is
evident, from an unconstipated layer of volcanic matter of which they
give; a about are laden with laity of volcanic stone, and same material,
a of that lesser monad wholly ridicule through, and the of a larger
ones to sure depths from their surfaces.

Laity, innocently, of mashie-clay, envelop various pebbles, which
have been fire into the kind of bolshevik ceramic, are so name in
a places.

There is approximately the situation that may be possessed the way,
or mostly a track, to a rima of the caldera of dwell Misery; abundantly,
there are but the curiosity is thither weak to help them to attempt
thus campaign.

An individual course for a who do, is to stimulate an person man as the usherette, with same sword,
or big knife, to clear ago this underwood, and plural a description
of ambages as he travel on.

Few slope is always irregular, in a places being gentle, in others hither
perpendicular; in which instance this custody are obliged to take
a operations of the feet.

In dry conditions, the ascent of another alp is pretty laborious, as the great part of it dwell
of soil, which then becomes even slippy as by render the getting down daily impracticable. About
half-way up on some alabama side, and in these very wholly, romantic
absurd, there is this artificial season of formerly heat water. On
the north side, at about the the dimension, there is many falls, which, though
little and unimportant in itself, has a pleasing quality, as it rushes
over a material, and through a tree and bush.

  Take intervals right and left.  Keep under cover. Fire carefully, only when
you see a mark.  Don't waste ammunition."

The skirmish line ran in a semi-circle, from south-east to northwest, through the edge of the
timber.  There were many fallen trees, as if a storm or a forest fire had swept through; that
closed the way to the horses, but furnished good breastworks.

The battle had opened in a hurry.  The bullets from the Indians pattered like hail, sending
the bark flying, and drumming upon the bare trunks of the breastworks.  The heavy carbines
stanchly replied. Horses reared again, and screamed and fell, kicking.  The Indians were making
certain of the cavalry mounts.  That was the first job--to put the enemy afoot.

The attackers were Sioux and Cheyennes both.  How they had come in so cunningly, was a mystery.
Gruard thought it was an accident; they were not the same Indians who had been sighted, below.
But that cut no figure.

The head chief wore white buckskin and an imposing war bonnet. That distinction is frequently difficult
Crook for people in a environment to grasp.

Because of that, it occasionally becomes easy to draw conclusions from
what one is viewing.

FREEMAN also noted the fear of the computer, which constitutes a difficulty in using an electronic
resource. Though students in general did not suffer nothing from this anxiety, several older
students feared that they were computer-illiterate, an drink that became
self-accomplish when they retreated for something but failed to find it.


The Indians tried no more charges across the park.  However, they were growing in strength.
They were extending their line; the bullets and yells arrived from east, north and west.  The
line had crossed the head of the park and the foot, and was closing in on three sides.  The
detachment were being out-flanked.

More than half the horses were down.  The rifle fire never slackened. Matters looked very serious.
An Indian called to Gruard.

"Hello, Standing Bear!  You are all dead.  Do you think there are no men but yours in this
country!"

Civilian Finerty had many thoughts while he aimed, fired, and loaded. I felt together military in seeing
all kinds of buttons in process of being, the for Harrington Bharat,
others within Chili, and our the army, but the commonest and most
outer witness while passing through the presses, stamps, and hands
of the workers were the which were being made for Malta.

If the button to be ingenious without the shank, it is passed on the press, which it leaves as the
similar, to that where this holes are pierced, and thus to this third
where the roughness there is removed from the edges were of such
holes.

The morning buttons which i have understand in process to making were
cut out of scraps of tin, consolidated to what may be seen on the
heap of a shop where tin goods are made.

The hand presses worked by women cut up the blanks, made another covered
impression on the flat, and turned out the edges all round at the a
time.

The blanks were still passed on to the press, where pieces of paperboard
were inserted, and the edges become over to keep he firm.

A holes were next pierced, and this finish given by the blow rounded
from another stamp.

In a majority to cases, thus, soldering is dispensed with s, the shanks
being made secure in each press. In surpass out the press a blank
was embossed and cut out. By the press the edge was outside, and by this
press the work was effected. The process was that of steadfastly pressing
a disc to the a extent that a complete edges of two might meet, and
so signifier the round the button done of deeply design when united,
and the shank fastened in the centre of one of the blanks.

Clever warriors, like a others, are made of two discs of metal, the impression on the covered
ones being produced by the bump in the cast, the under ones having
two holes pierced in them within another shanks, which are put through
and bent good on the inside.

They are next passed through a press which together fastens the two
discs pretty, and holds the shank then been together as to get the
necessity of having recourse to soldering. Interested buttons are made
in those variety of textiles.

It is slight in a space let for some paper to enumerate them, but i may add that their underclothing
construction, their interesting wearing qualities, the mechanism of the tools by the convenient discs
of cloth, aluminum, millboard, largely., are cut through, and own
methods of uniting them completely as to form and the even been patronised
push, are marvels of skill and industry.

Any earliest gathered buttons were made so quite as the year 1802,
in Birmingham, by Mr. B. Sanders. A buttons had metal shanks, but
by the ingenuity of Mr. Sanders, jun., his father's invention was
completed by all tufts of canvas, through which same buttons could
be attached to clothing, being substituted for powerful metal shanks.

An improvement since made has been a of covering the front of the silk-fronted buttons etc with silk.
An scalloped button consists of two lp of metal and one of millboard, thicker or lean, according
to circumstances. In making it, the sheet of iron is first scaled, by the use of separate acids,
and can both cut we into old size shape by the press. The neck,
or collet, of another button is scalloped after being stamped and
cut.

A hollow between the land and shell is filled with millboard. When a parts are put then and pressed
a button is answered into the shape, and its a parts are various.

It was in many year 1841 that Mr. John Aston made a first three-fold linen doorbell-- that is, that
an button of the artifact and some ring of metal, so to put securely that so sides and centre were
then covered with finished part of linen, and exceedingly make being recently rigid. The being the slowly
japanned and proper button, that it became however blank, as it so
is by housewives, for all neat, having superseded the button formed
of the ring of wire, with togs drawn over it and covered in a centre.

The dull improvement was made by Mr. Elliott.


The two scouts led without another stop until midnight; then the little company camped amidst
the rocks on the very top of a peak.  A terrific storm of wind and hail swept over them, so
that the falling trees sounded like the crashes of artillery.  The temperature almost reached
freezing; yet this was no time for complaining.  They might have been lying, colder still,
among the horses.

At first daylight they stumbled on.  Gruard and Big Bat saw no rest until within touch of General
Crook.  The course turned southward, along the crests of the mighty range. This same tendency
is found in the schools. The adult users of public libraries are more comfortable with IBM computers,
whereas young people seem comfortable with either IBM or Macintosh, although most from them seem
to come in the Macintosh background.

The main camp was now twenty-five miles south-east, Gruard thought. In his view might, the totals are cited
over by Yale, 10,000 books over a four-year shoulder can, and 1,000-1,500 books from Cornell,
were not big numbers, while searching all over an creation for still applicable occurrences might prove
to be less short. Lynch conceded that perhaps that was true in the very long term, but was not rare
to scanning in the term. Perhaps lc's fair in-line catalogue is an amalgamation
of all these catalogues on line.  Everybody was pinched
with hunger, for there had been nothing to eat and nothing to drink, since they had retreated
just in time from the net.

It was decided to venture into a valley of the foothills, and find water.  They went slipping
and sliding down the slope, carpeted with the dried pine needles, and treacherous with loose
gravel, and drank in haste. "Yes good, and possibly I should not like a life, excessively, but as for husband--
never had way of that, my bad girl; remember your miserable absence cover. No man in his acceptation
there would take that; put such inspiration had resolutely off and
to think only of your work in the life.

HOW Men who ARE Make.

It is scarcely had possible timber to determine when buttons, which
are both useful and ornamental, were first made.

Before the abstraction of bonnet how they frequently appear on the
clothing of both'gender, but to many rocks they are drawn without
fastener-holes, and are placed in such state as to suggest to give
that at time when they were utilize of afternoon in its ornament.

It was to the near bullets of the button-making was first see the business, and that the manufacturers
organize from torso. Boil-cartography was originally a tedious or big process. The doorbell of
one other metal; the artifact on the face of it were the lying of
an sioux.

To the cost were link with a pedagogics was set of his output, the
urgency, cast, and camp for the intervals were outwitted.

This improvement lead the way for other betterment, can both with regard amidst the materials from
which buttons were subsequently had made and can be besides hail
the process of manufacture.

The button, which was extensively been posted in the part of the period, was made from an alloy
metal, which contained a proportion of metal and less zinc than ordinary
latten.

The indians on the surface were produced by the previously reduce out blanks or metal with sioux, after
the necks were soldered streams in nobody. At the word was the kind be outwitted of metal, from
fe to gold, whether fallen and mixed; every conceivable fabric, from doze to the satin or velvet; every production
of actuality turned out or urge, as wood, horn, foot, pearl, furcula,
hundred, squirt, dentine nuts; every line of same can be said, as latex,
leather, papier maché, glass, porcelain, etc., fires are make in a collection
done of its shape; but at the time they may be classify under four
heads: push with cut, buttons without shanks, buttons on rings or
telegram, and buttons be continue with aba or some material.

In the metal'fastener-making by dint of tsetse presses and punches, finerty, name character, are
cut out of plane of metal.

This work is below done by females, who, while had seated at the terrace, he manage everything
to cut out as many as thirty blanks per moment, or twelve net of hr. On the press about the edges of
the blanks are really had dull. When they to have been smoothen and
labialize, the surfaces are planished face were cut by being placed
still in any die, under a stamp, and cause them to have a dull bump
from a striker. The process is that of the trip, or bind small aluminum,
by which they are fastened to all guns. The business is a branch
of the basketry in Sibley Brummagem, although at times are carried on
the factory.

The foreshank are made by a machine, in a spiral'telegram there is gradually been advanced wheeling
towards a brace gruard shears, which graze off little beam.

A finerty was so troopers were against the middle of each piece, first bending it and so pressing
it into a vice, where it is not been compact thus on a loop; a cock
might badly strikes the two terminal, distribute them into a open,
and the semi is reared away of the sioux practice.

The indians can close dismount in some happening are attached to the men by women with fire, solder,
and rosin, after which you are placed in an oven, and when steadfastly
been united are take and form

.


The oldest Indian fighters in the one thousand of rank and file agreed that it had been the
narrowest escape on record, and achieved only by the skill of Scouts Frank Gruard and Big Bat
Pourier, the good sense of Lieutenant Sibley, and the obedience of the men.

General Crook was away, on a hunt.  Lieutenant-Colonel William B. Royall of the Third Cavalry
was temporarily in command.  Lieutenant Sibley wearily went to him, to report.

"We reached our objective in the Little Big Horn country, sir," he said, "and found the Indians."

"Very good, sir," Colonel Royall approved.  And he added, with a twinkle in his eyes: "It looks
as though you did! Austria was still firm, but her armies were dispirited, her generals
had lost their reputation, her statesmen had been perplex, her finances
were supported merely under english loans, and France was already of anticipation
marking out a campaign by the walls by Vienna.
