'No; when people carry souls in their pens, they are worth a great deal more, if they are to
go to a distance.'

Ah! by the bye, I suppose Cheviot has put a fresh lock on Mary's writing-case.'

'I suspect some of Mary's correspondence will devolve on me.  Harry has asked me already.'

'I wished you had mentioned more about the letters of late.  Leonard wanted to know more than
I could tell him.'

'You don't mean that you have seen him?  O, Tom, how kind of you! Papa has been trying hard
to get a day now that these first six months are up; but there are two or three cases that
wanted so much watching that he has not been able to stir.'

'I know how he lets himself be made a prisoner, and that it was a chance whether any one saw
the poor fellow at all.'

'I am so glad'--and Ethel turned on him a face still flushed, but now with gratitude.  'How
was he looking?'

'The costume is not becoming, and he has lost colour and grown hollow-eyed; but I saw no reason
for being uneasy about him; he looked clear and in health, and has not got to slouch yet. 
It is shocking to see such a grand face and head behind a grating.'

'Could he talk'?

'Why, the presence of a warder is against conversation, and six months of shoe-making in a
cell does not give much range of ideas. There was nothing to be done but to talk on right ahead
and judge by his eyes if he liked it.'

'I suppose you could find out nothing about himself?'

'He said he got on very well; but one does not know that means.  I asked if he got books; and
he said there was a very good library, and he could get what gave him something to think of;
and he says they give interesting lectures in school.'

'You could not gather what is thought of him?'

'No; I saw but a couple of officers of the place, and could only get out of them "good health
and good conduct."  I do not expect even his conduct makes much impression as to his innocence,
for I saw it stated the other day that the worst prisoners are those that are always getting
convicted for petty offences; those that have committed one great crime are not so depraved,
and are much more amenable.  However, he has only three months more at Pentonville, and then
he will go to Portland, Chatham, or Gibraltar.'

'Oh, I hope it will not be Gibraltar!  But at least that terrible solitude will be over.'

'At any rate, his spirit is not broken.  I could see his eye light up after I had talked a
little while, and he fell into his natural tone again.  He would not try to put out his hand
to me when he came down; but when I went away, he put it through and we had a good hearty shake.
Somehow it made one feel quite small.'

Ethel could have pledged herself for the soundness of Tom's nature after those words; but all
she did was in an unwonted tone to utter the unwonted exclamation--'Dear Tom.'

'If my father does not come up, I shall see him once more before he leaves Pentonville,' added
Tom; 'and so you must mind and let me know all about his people in America.  I found he had
no notion of the row that is beginning there, so I said not a word of it.  But what is all
this about going to Indiana?'

'They are going at the end of April to settle in a place called Massissauga, where Henry is
to farm till practice comes to him.  It is towards the north of the State, in the county of
Pulaski.'

'Ay, in one of the pestilential swamps that run up out of Lake Michigan.  All the fertile ground
there breeds as many fevers and agues as it does stalks of corn.'

'Indeed! how did you hear that?'

'I looked up the place after Leonard told me of it.  It is as unlucky a location as the ill
luck of that fellow Henry could have pitched on. Some friend Leonard spoke of--a Yankee, I
suppose, meaning to make a prey of them.'

'The father of their young lady friend at the boarding-house.'

'Oh! a Yankee edition of Mrs. Pugh!'

'And the worst of it is that this is to be done with poor Averil's fortune.  She has written
to Mr. Bramshaw to sell out for her, and send her the amount, and he is terribly vexed; but
she is of age, and there are no trustees nor any one to stop it.'

'All of a piece,' muttered Tom; then presently he swung the basket round on the ground with
a vehement exclamation--'If any man on this earth deserved to be among the robbers and murderers,
I know who it is.'  Then he shouldered his load again, and walked on in silence by his sister's
side to the school door.

Richard had been obliged to go to a benefit club entertainment; and Ethel, knowing the limited
literary resources of the parsonage, was surprised to find Tom still waiting for her, when
the distribution and fitting of the blue-ribboned hats was over, and matters arranged for the
march of the children to see the wedding, and to dine afterwards at the Grammar-school hall.

'O, Tom, I did not expect to find you here.'

'It is not fit for you to be walking about alone on a Whit Monday.'

'I am very glad to have you, but I am past that.'

'Don't talk nonsense; girls are girls till long past your age,' said Tom.

'It is not so much age, as living past things,' said Ethel.

'It was not only that, added Tom; 'but I've more to say to you, while one can be sure of a
quiet moment.  Have you heard anything about that place?' and he pointed in the direction of
the Vintry Mill.

  There was a proposal to join forces,
and have a double wedding--so interesting, the two school-fellows and two young friends.  The
Cheviot girls much regretted it was not to be.'

'Cheviot girls!  Heavens and earth!  At home?'

'Not sleeping; but we shall have them all day to-morrow, for they cannot get home the same
day by setting off after the wedding.  There will be no one else, for even our own people are
going, for Harry is to go to Maplewood with Blanche, and Aubrey has to be at Woolwich; but
we shall all be at home to-night.'

'Last time was in the volunteer days, two or three centuries ago.'

It was strange how, with this naturally least congenial of all the family, Ethel had a certain
understanding and fellow-feeling that gave her a sense of rest and relief in his company, only
impaired by the dread of rubs between him and his father.  None, however, happened; Dr. May
had been too much hurt to press the question of the inheritance, and took little notice of
Tom, being much occupied with the final business about the wedding, and engrossed by Hector
and Harry, who always absorbed him in their short intervals of his company.  Tom went to see
Dr. Spencer, and brought him in, so cheerful and full of life, that what Ethel had been hearing
seemed like a dream, excepting when she recognized Tom's unobtrusive gentleness and attention
towards him.

She was surprised and touched through all the harass and hurry of that evening and morning,
to find the 'must be dones' that had of late devolved on her alone, now lightened and aided
by Tom, who appeared to have come for the sole purpose of being always ready to give a helping
hand where she wanted it, with all Richard's manual dexterity, and more resource and quickness.
The refreshment of spirits was the more valuable as this was a very unexciting wedding. Even
Gertrude, not yet fourteen, had been surfeited with weddings, and replied to Harry's old wit
of 'three times a bridesmaid and never a bride,' that she hoped so, her experience of married
life was extremely flat; and a glance at Blanche's monotonous dignity, and Flora's worn face,
showed what that experience was.

Harry was the only one to whom there was the freshness of novelty, and he was the great element
of animation; but as the time came near, honest Harry had been seized with a mortal dread of
the tears he imagined an indispensable adjunct of the ceremony, and went about privately consulting
every one how much weeping was inevitable. Flora told him she saw no reason for any tears,
and Ethel that when people felt very much they couldn't cry; but on the other hand, Blanche
said she felt extremely nervous, and knew she should be overcome; Gertrude assured him that
on all former occasions Mary did all the crying herself; and Aubrey told him that each bridesmaid
carried six handkerchiefs, half for herself and half for the bride.

The result was, that the last speech made by Harry to his favourite sister in her maiden days
was thus:--'Well, Mary, you do look uncommonly nice and pretty; but now'--most persuasively--'you'll
be a good girl and not cry, will you?' and as Mary fluttered, tried to smile, and looked out
through very moist eyes, he continued, 'I feel horribly soft-hearted to-day, and if you howl
I must, you know; so mind, if I see you beginning, I shall come out with my father's old story
of the spirit of the flood and the spirit of the fell, and that will stop it, if anything can.'

The comicality of Harry's alarm was nearly enough to 'stop it,' coupled with the great desire
of Daisy that he should be betrayed into tears; and Mary did behave extremely well, and looked
all that a bride should look.  Admirable daughter and sister, she would be still more in her
place as wife; hers was the truly feminine nature that, happily for mankind, is the most commonplace,
and that she was a thoroughly generic bride is perhaps a testimony to her perfection in the
part, as in all others where quiet unselfish womanhood was the essential.  Never had she been
so sweet in every tone, word, and caress; never had Ethel so fully felt how much she loved
her, or how entirely they had been one, from a time almost too far back for memory.  There
had not been intellectual equality; but perhaps it was better, fuller affection, than if there
had been; for Mary had filled up a part that had been in some measure wanting in Ethel.  She
had been a sort of wife to her sister, and thus was the better prepared for her new life, but
was all the sorer loss at home.

The bridegroom!  How many times had Ethel to remind herself of her esteem, and security of
Mary's happiness, besides frowning down Gertrude's saucy comments, and trying to laugh away
Tom's low growl that good things always fell to the share of poor hearts and narrow minds.
Mr. Cheviot did in fact cut a worse figure than George Rivers of old, having a great fund of
natural bashfulness and self-consciousness, which did not much damage his dignity, but made
his attempts at gaiety and ease extremely awkward, not to say sheepish. Perhaps the most trying
moment was the last, when hearing a few words between Ethel and Mary about posting a mere scrap,
if only an empty envelope, from the first resting-place, he turned round, with his laugh, to
object to rash promises, and remind his dear sister Ethel that post-offices were not always
near at hand!  After that, when Mary in her bright tenderness hung round her sister, it was
as if that was the last fond grasp from the substance--as if only the shadow would come back
and live in Minster Street.

Perhaps it was because Ethel had tried to rule it otherwise, Mr. Cheviot had insisted that
the Cocksmoor children's share in the festivity should be a dinner in the Whichcote hall, early
in the day, after which they had to be sent home, since no one chose to have the responsibility
of turning them loose to play in the Grammar-school precincts, even in the absence of the boys.
Richard was much afraid of their getting into mischief, and was off immediately after church
to superintend the dinner, and marshal them home; and the rest of the world lost the resource
that entertaining them generally afforded the survivors after a marriage, and which was specially
needed with the two Cheviot sisters to be disposed of.  By the time the Riverses were gone
home, and the Ernescliffes and Harry off by the train, there were still four mortal hours of
daylight, and oh! for Mary's power of making every one happy!

Caroline and Annie Cheviot were ladylike, nice-looking girls; but when they found no croquet
mallets in the garden, they seemed at a loss what life had to offer at Stoneborough!  Gertrude
pronounced that 'she played at it sometimes at Maplewood, where she had nothing better to do,'
and then retreated to her own devices.  Ethel's heart sank both with dread of the afternoon,
and with self-reproach at her spoilt child's discourtesy, whence she knew there would be no
rousing her without an incapacitating discussion; and on she wandered in the garden with the
guests, receiving instruction where the hoops might be planted, and hearing how nice it would
be for her sister to have such an object, such a pleasant opportunity of meeting one's friends--an
interest for every day.  'No wonder they think I want an object in life,' thought Ethel; 'how
awfully tiresome I must be!  Poor things, what can I say to make it pleasanter?--Do you know
this Dielytra?  I think it is the prettiest of modern flowers, but I wish we might call it
Japan fumitory, or by some English name.'

'I used to garden once, but we have no flower-beds now, they spoilt the lawn for croquet.'

'And here comes Tom,' thought Ethel; 'poor Tom, he will certainly be off to London this evening.'

Tom, however, joined the listless promenade; and the first time croquet was again mentioned,
observed that he had seen the Andersons knocking about the balls in the new gardens by the
river; and proposed to go down and try to get up a match.  There was an instant brightening,
and Tom stepped into the drawing-room, and told Daisy to come with them.

'To play at croquet with the Andersons in the tea-gardens!' she exclaimed.  'No, I thank you,
Thomas!'

He laid his hand on her shoulder--'Gertrude,' he said, 'it is time to have done being a spoilt
baby.  If you let Ethel fag herself ill, you will rue it all your life.'

Frightened, but without clear comprehension, she turned two scared eyes on him, and replaced
the hat that she had thrown on the table, just as Ethel and the others came in.

'Not you, Ethel,' said Tom; 'you don't know the game.'

'I can learn,' said Ethel, desperately bent on her duty.

'We would teach you,' volunteered the Cheviots.

'You would not undertake it if you knew better,' said Tom, smiling. 'Ethel's hands are not
her strong point.'

'Ethel would just have to be croqued all through by her partner,' said Gertrude.

'Besides, my father will be coming in and wanting you,' added Tom; 'he is only at the hospital
or somewhere about the town.  I'll look after this child.'

And the two sisters, delighted that poor little Gertrude should have such a holiday treat as
croquet in the public gardens, away from her governess elder sister, walked off glorious; while
Ethel, breathing forth a heavy sigh, let herself sink into a chair, feeling as if the silence
were in itself invaluable, and as if Tom could not be enough thanked for having gained it for her.

She was first roused by the inquiry, 'Shall I take in this letter, ma'am? it is charged four
shillings over-weight.  And it is for Mr. Thomas, ma'am,' impressively concluded the parlour-maid,
as one penetrated by Mr. Thomas's regard to small economies.

Ethel beheld a letter bloated beyond the capacities of the two bewigged Washingtons that kept
guard in its corner, and addressed in a cramped hand unknown to her; but while she hesitated,
her eye fell on another American letter directed to Miss Mary May, in Averil Ward's well-known
writing, and turning both round, she found they had the same post-mark, and thereupon paid
the extra charge, and placed the letter where Tom was most likely to light naturally on it
without public comment.  The other letter renewed the pang at common property being at an end.
'No, Mab,' she said, taking the little dog into her lap, 'we shall none of us hear a bit of
it!  But at least it is a comfort that this business is over!  You needn't creep under sofas
now, there's nobody to tread upon your dainty little paws.  What is to be done, Mab, to get
out of a savage humour--except thinking how good-natured poor Tom is!'

There was not much sign of savage humour in the face that was lifted up as Dr. May came in
from the hospital, and sitting down by his daughter, put his arm round her.  'So there's another
bird flown,' he said.  'We shall soon have the old nest to ourselves, Ethel.'

'The Daisy is not going just yet,' said Ethel, stroking back the thin flying flakes over his
temples.  'If we may believe her, never!'

'Ah! she will be off before we can look round,' said the Doctor; 'when once the trick of marrying
gets among one's girls, there's no end to it, as long as they last out.'

'Nor to one's boys going out into the world,' said Ethel: both of them talking as if she had
been his wife, rather than one of these fly-away younglings herself.

'Ah! well,' he said, 'it's very pretty while it lasts, and one keeps the creatures; but after
all, one doesn't rear them for one's own pleasure.  That only comes by the way of their chance
good-will to one.'

'For shame, Doctor!' said Ethel, pretending to shake him by the collar.

'I was thinking,' he added, 'that we must not require too much. People must have their day,
and in their own fashion; and I wish you would tell Tom--I've no patience to do it myself--that
I don't mean to hamper him.  As long as it is a right line, he may take whichever he pleases,
and I'll do my best to set him forward in it; but it is a pity--'

'Perhaps a few years of travelling, or of a professorship, might give him time to think differently,'
said Ethel.

'Not he,' said the Doctor; 'the more a man lives in the world, the more he depends on it. 
Where is the boy? is he gone without vouchsafing a good-bye?'

'Oh no, he has taken pity on Annie and Caroline Cheviot's famine of croquet, and gone with
them to the gardens.'

'A spice of flirtation never comes amiss to him.'

'There, that's the way!' said Ethel, half-saucily, half-caressingly; 'that poor fellow never
can do right! I addressed you make to endure I have received one communications were-- at you thought,

for that's what people always begin by--'

'Nothing worse than pale ale.'  At which Ethel made one of her faces. 'And to make a Mary of
that chit of a Daisy.  Well, you may do as you please--only take care, or Flora will be down
upon us.'

'Tom has been very helpful and kind to me,' said Ethel.  'And, papa, he has seen Leonard, and
he says he looked so noble that to shake hands with him made him feel quite small.'

'I never heard anything so much to Tom's credit!  Well, and what did he say of the dear lad?'

The next step was to mention Averil's letter to Mary, which could not be sent on till tidings
had been permitted by Mr. Cheviot.

'Let us see it,' said the Doctor.

'Do you think Charles Cheviot would like it?'

'Cheviot is a man of sense,' said the open-hearted Doctor, 'and there may be something to authorize
preventing this unlucky transfer of her fortune.'

Nothing could be further from it; but it was a long and interesting letter, written in evidently
exhilarated spirits, and with a hopeful description of the new scenes.  Ethel read it to her
father, and he told every one about it when they came in.  Tom manifested no particular interest;
but he did not go by the mail train that night, and was not visible all the morning.  He caught
Ethel alone however at noon, and said, 'Ethel, I owe you this,' offering the amount she had
paid for the letter.

'Thank you,' she said, wondering if this was to be all she should hear about it.

'I am going by the afternoon train,' he added; 'I have been over to Blewer.  It is true, Ethel,
the fellow can't stand it! he has sent down a manager, and is always in London!  Most likely
to dispose of it by private contract there, they say.'

'And what has become of old Hardy?'

'Poor old fellow, he has struck work, looks terribly shaky.  He took me for my father at first
sight, and began to apologize most plaintively--said no one else had ever done him any good.
I advised him to come in and see my father, though he is too far gone to do much for him.'

'Poor old man, can he afford to come in now?'

'Why, I helped him with the cart hire.  It is no use any way, he knows no more than we do,
and his case is confirmed; but he thinks he has offended my father, and he'll die more in peace
for having had him again.  Look here, what a place they have got to.'

And without further explanation of the 'they,' Tom placed a letter in Ethel's hands.

'My Dear Mr. Thomas,

'I send you the objects I promised for your microscope; I could not get any before because
we were in the city; but if you like these I can get plenty more at Massissauga, where we are
now.  We came here last week, and the journey was very nice, only we went bump bump so often,
and once we stuck in a marsh, and were splashed all over.  We are staying with Mr. Muller and
Cora till our own house is quite ready; it was only begun a fortnight ago, and we are to get
in next week.  I thought this would have been a town, it looked so big and so square in the
plan; but it is all trees still, and there are only thirteen houses built yet. Ours is all
by itself in River Street, and all the trees near it have been killed, and stand up all dead
and white, because nobody has time to cut them down.  It looks very dismal, but Ave says it
will be very nice by and by, and, Rufus Muller says it has mammoth privileges.  I send you
a bit of rattlesnake skin.  They found fifteen of them asleep under a stone, just where our
house is built, and sometimes they come into the kitchen.  I do not know the names of the other
things I send; and I could not ask Ave, for she said you would not want to be bothered with
a little girl's letter, and I was not to ask for an answer. Rosa Willis says no young lady
of my age would ask her sister's permission, and not even her mother's, unless her mamma was
very intellectual and highly educated, and always saw the justice of her arguments; but Minna
and I do not mean to be like that.  I would tell Ave if you did write to me, but she need not
read it unless she liked.

                       'I am, your affectionate little friend,
                                                           'ELLA.'

'Well!' said Tom, holding out his hand for more when she had restored this epistle.  'You have
heard all there was in it, except--'

'Except what I want to see.'

And Ethel, as she had more or less intended all along, let him have Averil's letter, since
the exception was merely a few tender words of congratulation to Mary. "that's just what i complain
them of robin," them said the King, his loftily. "you couldn't may straight state his Mesa-- if
you glanced about
hands." "i wear't tell of truth of the lands with my hands," the
Queen was objected, icily.

"nobody
glanced them did," said the Queen.

'For the future,' said Tom, as he gave back the thin sheets, 'they will all be for the Cheviots'
private delectation.'

'I shall begin on my own score,' said Ethel.  'You know if you answer this letter, you must
not mention that visit of yours, or you will be prohibited, and one would not wish to excite
a domestic secession.'

'It would serve the unnatural scoundrel right,' said Tom.  'Well, I must go and put up my things.
You'll keep me up to what goes on at home, and if there's anything out there to tell Leonard--'

'Wait a moment, Tom!'--and she told him what the Doctor had said about his plans.

'Highly educated and intellectual,' was all the answer that Tom vouchsafed; and whether he
were touched or not she could not gather.

Yet her spirit felt less weary and burdened, and more full of hope than it had been for a long
time past.  Averil's letter showed the exhilaration of the change, and of increasing confidence
and comfort in her friend Cora Muller.  Cora's Confirmation had brought the girls into contact
with the New York clergy, and had procured them an introduction to the clergyman of Winiamac,
the nearest church, so that there was much less sense of loneliness, moreover, the fuller and
more systematic doctrine, and the development of the beauty and daily guidance of the Church,
had softened the bright American girl, so as to render her infinitely dearer to her English
friend, and they were as much united as they could be, where the great leading event of the
life of one remained a mystery to the other.  Yet perhaps it helped to begin a fresh life,
that the intimate companion of that new course should be entirely disconnected with the past.

Averil threw herself into the present with as resolute a will as she could muster. ***** a Failure LUNCHEON.--

But as Cora was quite content to leave Miss behind her in civilized society, and as they were
assured that to stand upon ceremony would leave them without domestic assistance, the sisters
had implored Henry to waive all preference for a polite address.

The loveliness of the way was enchanting--the roads running straight as an arrow through glorious
forest lands of pine, beech, maple, and oak, in the full glory of spring, and the perspective
before and behind making a long narrowing green bower of meeting branches; the whole of the
borders of the road covered with lovely flowers--May-wings, a butterfly-like milkwort, pitcher-plant,
convolvulus; new insects danced in the shade--golden orioles, blue birds, the great American

delicate kid boots, without which no city damsel stirred.  Averil and her sisters, in the English
boots scorned at New York, had their share in the laugh, while picking their way from log to
log, hand in hand, and exciting Philetus's further disdain by their rapture with the glorious
flowers of the bog.

But where was Massissauga?  Several settlements had been passed, the houses looking clean and
white in forest openings, with fields where the lovely spring green of young maize charmed the eye.

At last the road grew desolate.  There were a few patches of corn, a few squalid-looking log
or frame houses, a tract of horrible dreary blackness; and still more horrible, beyond it was
a region of spectres--trees white and stripped bare, lifting their dead arms like things blasted. Mr.
JONES,-- not our ENERY HAUTHOR, whose contempt for Lampoon formerly is
that good cognize of he can do it,-- wrote as Mister. ARTHUR ROBERTS,
today to the Section Halls and generally to the Period, styling him
"Governor," and legitimate as we would "fit him of a Pyrimidine."
Your exhausted civilization is not as energetic as ours, I calculate.'

The energetic young colonist turned his horse's head up a slight rising ground, where something
rather more like habitation appeared; a great brick-built hotel, and some log houses, with
windows displaying the wares needed for daily consumption, and a few farm buildings.  It was
backed by corn-fields; and this was the great Maclellan Street, the chief ornament of Massissauga.
Not one house had the semblance of a garden; the wilderness came up to the very door, except
where cattle rendered some sort of enclosure necessary.

Cora exclaimed, 'Oh, Mordaunt, I thought you would have had a garden for me!'

'I can fix it any time you like,' said he; 'but you'll be the laughing-stock of the place,
and never keep a flower.'

The Mullers' abode was a sound substantial log house, neatly whitened, and with green shutters,
bearing a festal appearance, full of welcome, as Mr. Muller, his tall bearded son Rufus, and
a thin but motherly-looking elderly woman, came forth to meet the travellers; and in the front,
full stare, stood a trollopy-looking girl, every bar of her enormous hoop plainly visible through
her washed-out flimsy muslin. This was Miss Ianthe, who condescended to favour the family with
her assistance till she should have made up dollars enough to buy a new dress!  The elder woman,
who went by the name of Cousin Deborah, would have been a housekeeper in England--here she
was one of the family--welcomed Cora with an exchange of kisses, and received the strangers
with very substantial hospitality, though with pity at their unfitness for their new home,
and utter incredulity as to their success.
