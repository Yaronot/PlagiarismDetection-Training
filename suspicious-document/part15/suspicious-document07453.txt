WOMAN AND MARRIAGE IN ANCIENT ROME

"Many things that among the Greeks are considered improper and unfitting," wrote Cornelius
Nepos in the preface to his "Lives," "are permitted by our customs.  Is there by chance a Roman
who is ashamed to take his wife to a dinner away from home?  Does it happen that the mistress
of the house in any family does not enter the anterooms frequented by strangers and show herself
among them?  Not so in Greece: there the woman accepts invitations only among families to which
she is related, and she remains withdrawn in that inner part of the house which is called the
gynaeceum, where only the nearest relatives are admitted."

This passage, one of the most significant in all the little work of Nepos, draws in a few,
clear, telling strokes one of the most marked distinctions between the Greco-Asiatic world
and the Roman.  Among ancient societies, the Roman was probably that in which, at least among
the better classes, woman enjoyed the greatest social liberty and the greatest legal and economic
autonomy.  There she most nearly approached that condition of moral and civil equality with
man which makes her his comrade, and not his slave--that equality in which modern civilization
sees one of the supreme ends of moral progress.

The doctrine held by some philosophers and sociologists, that military peoples subordinate
woman to a tyrannical régime of domestic servitude, is wholly disproved by the history of Rome.
If there was ever a time when the Roman woman lived in a state of perennial tutelage, under
the authority of man from birth to death--of the husband, if not of the father, or, if not
of father or husband, of the guardian--that time belongs to remote antiquity.

When Rome became the master state of the Mediterranean world, and especially during the last
century of the republic, woman, aside from a few slight limitations of form rather than of
substance, had already acquired legal and economic independence, the condition necessary for
social and moral equality.  As to marriage, the affianced pair could at that time choose between
two different legal family régimes: marriage with manus, the older form, in which all the goods
of the wife passed to the ownership of the husband, so that she could no longer possess anything
in her own name; or marriage without manus, in which only the dower became the property of
the husband, and the wife remained mistress of all her other belongings and all that she might
acquire. Except in some cases, and for special reasons, in all the families of the aristocracy,
by common consent, marriages, during the last centuries of the republic, were contracted in
the later form; so that at that time married women directly and openly had gained economic
independence.

During the same period, indirectly, and by means of juridical evasions, this independence was
also won by unmarried women, who, according to ancient laws, ought to have remained all their
lives under a guardian, either selected by the father in his will or appointed by the law in
default of such selection.  To get around this difficulty, the fertile and subtle imagination
of the jurists invented first the tutor optivus, permitting the father, instead of naming his
daughter's guardian in his will, to leave her free to choose one general guardian or several,
according to the business in hand, or even to change that official as many times as she wished.

To give the woman means to change her legitimate guardian at pleasure, if her father had provided
none by will, there was invented the tutor cessicius, thereby allowing the transmission of
a legal guardianship. However, though all restrictions imposed upon the liberty of the unmarried
woman by the institution of tutelage disappeared, one limitation continued in force--she could
not make a will.  Yet even this was provided for, either by fictitious marriage or by the invention
of the tutor fiduciarius.  The woman, without contracting matrimony, gave herself by coemptio
(purchase) into the manus of a person of her trust, on the agreement that the coemptionator
would free her: he became her guardian in the eyes of the law.

There was, then, at the close of the republic little disparity in legal condition between the
man and the woman.  As is natural, to this almost complete legal equality there was united
an analogous moral and social equality.  The Romans never had the idea that between the mundus
muliebris (woman's world) and that of men they must raise walls, dig ditches, put up barricades,
either material or moral.  They never willed, for example, to divide women from men by placing
between them the ditch of ignorance.  To be sure, the Roman dames of high society were for
a long time little instructed, but this was because, moreover, the men distrusted Greek culture.
When literature, science, and Hellenic philosophy were admitted into the great Roman families
as desired and welcome guests, neither the authority, nor the egoism, nor yet the prejudices
of the men, sought to deprive women of the joy, the comfort, the light, that might come to
them from these new studies.  We know that many ladies in the last two centuries of the republic
not only learned to dance and to sing,--common feminine studies, these,--but even learned Greek,
loved literature, and dabbled in philosophy, reading its books or meeting with the famous philosophers
of the Orient.

Moreover, in the home the woman was mistress, at the side of and on equality with her husband.
The passage I have quoted from Nepos proves that she was not segregated, like the Greek woman:
she received and enjoyed the friends of her husband, was present with them at festivals and
banquets in the houses of families with whom she had friendly relations, although at such banquets
she might not, like the man, recline, but must, for the sake of greater modesty, sit at table.
In short, she was not, like the Greek woman, shut up at home, a veritable prisoner.

She might go out freely; this she did generally in a litter.  She was never excluded from theaters,
even though the Roman government tried as best it could for a long period to temper in its
people the passion for spectacular entertainments.  She could frequent public places and have
recourse directly to the magistrates.  We have record of the assembling and of demonstrations
made by the richest women of Rome in the Forum and other public places, to obtain laws and
other provisions from the magistrates, like that famous demonstration of women that Livy describes
as having occurred in the year 195 B.C., to secure the abolition of the Oppian Law against luxury.

What more?  We have good reason for holding that already under the republic there existed at
Rome a kind of woman's club, which called itself conventus matronarum and gathered together
the dames of the great families.  Finally, it is certain that many times in critical moments
the government turned directly and officially to the great ladies of Rome for help to overcome
the dangers that menaced public affairs, by collecting money, or imploring with solemn religious
ceremonies the favor of the gods.

One understands then, how at all times there were at Rome women much interested in public affairs.
The fortunes of the powerful families, their glory, their dominance, their wealth, depended
on the vicissitudes of politics and of war.  The heads of these families were all statesmen,
diplomats, warriors; the more intelligent and cultivated the wife, and the fonder she was of
her husband, the intenser the absorption with which she must have followed the fortunes of
politics, domestic and foreign; for with these were bound up many family interests, and often
even the life of her husband.

Was the Roman family, then, the reader will demand at this point, in everything like the family
of contemporary civilization?  Have we returned upon the long trail to the point reached by
our far-away forebears?

No.  If there are resemblances between the modern family and the Roman, there are also crucial
differences.  Although the Roman was disposed to allow woman judicial and economic independence,
a refined culture, and that freedom without which it is impossible to enjoy life in dignified
and noble fashion, he was never ready to recognize in the way modern civilization does more
or less openly, as ultimate end and reason for marriage, either the personal happiness of the
contracting parties or their common personal moral development in the unifying of their characters
and aspirations.  The individualistic conception of matrimony and of the family attained by
our civilization was alien to the Roman mind, which conceived of these from an essentially
political and social point of view.  The purpose of marriage was, so to speak, exterior to
the pair.  As untouched by any spark of the metaphysical spirit as he was unyielding--at least
in action--to every suggestion of the philosophic; preoccupied only in enlarging and consolidating
the state of which he was master, the Roman aristocrat never regarded matrimony and the family,
just as he never regarded religion and law, as other than instruments for political domination,
as means for increasing and establishing the power of every great family, and by family affiliations
to strengthen the association of the aristocracy, already bound together by political interest.

For this reason, although the Roman conceded many privileges and recognized many rights among
women, he never went so far as to think that a woman of great family could aspire to the right
of choosing her own husband.  Custom, indeed, much restricted the young man also, at least
in a first marriage.  The choice rested with the fathers, who were accustomed to affiance their
sons early, indeed when mere boys. The heads of two friendly families would find themselves
daily together in the struggle of the Forum and the Comitia, or in the deliberations of the
Senate.  Did the idea occur to both that their children, if affianced then, at seven or eight
years of age, might cement more closely the union of the two families, then straightway the
matter was definitely arranged.  The little girl was brought up with the idea that some day,
as soon as might be, she should marry that boy, just as for two centuries in the famous houses
of Catholic countries many of the daughters were brought up in the expectation that one day
they should take the veil.

Every one held this Roman practice as reasonable, useful, equitable; to no one did the idea
occur that by it violence was done to the most intimate sentiment of liberty and independence
that a human being can know.  On the contrary, according to the common judgment, the well-governing
of the state was being wisely provided for, and these alliances were destroying the seeds of
discord that spontaneously germinate in aristocracy and little by little destroy it, like those
plants sown by no man's hand, which thrive upon old walls and become their ruin.

This is why one knows of every famous Roman personage how many wives he had and of what family
they were.  The marriage of a Roman noble was a political act, and noteworthy; because a youth,
or even a mature man, connecting himself with certain families, came to assume more or less
fully the political responsibilities in which, for one cause or another, they were involved.
This was particularly true in the last centuries of the republic,--that is, beginning from
the Gracchi,--when for the various reasons which I have set forth in my "Greatness and Decline
of Rome," the Roman aristocracy divided into two inimical parties, one of which attempted to
rouse against the other the interests, the ambitions, and the cupidity, of the middle and lower
classes.  The two parties then sought to reinforce themselves by matrimonial alliances, and
these followed the ups and downs of the political struggle that covered Rome with blood.  Of
this fact the story of Julius Caesar is a most curious proof.

The prime reason for Julius Caesar's becoming the chief of the popular party is to be found
neither in his ambitions nor in his temperament, and even less in his political opinions, but
in his relationship to Marius.  An aunt of Caesar had married Caius Marius, the modest bankrupt
farmer of revenues, who, having entered politics, had become the first general of his time,
had been elected consul six times, and had conquered Jugurtha, the Cimbri, and the Teutons.
The self-made man had become famous and rich, and in the face of an aristocracy proud of its
ancestors, had tried to ennoble his obscure origin by taking his wife from an ancient and most
noble, albeit impoverished and decayed, patrician family.

But when there broke out the revolution in which Marius placed himself at the head of the popular
party, and the revolution was overcome by Sulla, the old aristocracy, which had conquered with
Sulla, did not forgive the patrician family of the Julii for having connected itself with that
bitter foe, who had made so much mischief.  Consequently, during the period of the reaction,
all its members were looked upon askance, and were suspected and persecuted, among them young
Caesar, who was in no way responsible for the deeds of his uncle, since he was only a lad during
the war between Sulla and Marius.

This explains how it was that the first wife of Caesar, Cossutia, was the daughter of a knight;
that is, of a financier and revenue-farmer. For a young man belonging to a family of ancient
senatorial nobility, this marriage was little short of a mésalliance; but Caesar had been engaged
to this girl when still a very young man, at the time when, the alliance between Marius and
the knights being still firm and strong, the marriage of a rich knight's daughter would mean
to the nephew of Marius, not only a considerable fortune, but also the support of the social
class which at that moment was predominant.  For reasons unknown to us, Caesar soon repudiated
Cossutia, and before the downfall of the democratic party he was married to Cornelia, who was
the daughter of Cinna, the democratic consul and a most distinguished member of the party of
Marius.  This second marriage, the causes of which must be sought for in the political status
of Caesar's family, was the cause of his first political reverses.  For Sulla tried to force
Caesar to repudiate Cornelia, and in consequence of his refusal, he came to be considered an
enemy by Sulla and his party and was treated accordingly.

It is known that Cornelia died when still very young, after only a few years of married life,
and that Caesar's third marriage in the year 68 B.C., was quite different from his first and
second, since the third wife, Pompeia, belonged to one of the noblest families of the conservative
aristocracy--was, in fact, a niece of Sulla.  How could the nephew of Marius, who had escaped
as by miracle the proscriptions of Sulla, ever have married the latter's niece?  Because in
the dozen years intervening between 80 and 68, the political situation had gradually grown
calmer, and a new air of conciliation had begun to blow through the city, troubled by so much
confusion, burying in oblivion the bloodiest records of the civil war, calling into fresh life
admiration for Marius, that hero who had conquered the Cimbri and the Teutons.  In that moment,
to be a nephew of Marius was no longer a crime among any of the great families; for some, on
the contrary, it was coming to be the beginning of glory.  But that situation was short-lived.
After a brief truce, the two parties again took up a bitter war, and for his fourth wife Caesar
chose Calpurnia, the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso, consul in 58, and a most influential
senator of the popular party.

Whoever studies the history of the influential personages of Caesar's time, will find that
their marriages follow the fortunes of the political situation.  Where a purely political reason
was wanting, there was the economic.  A woman could aid powerfully a political career in two
ways: by ably administering the household and by contributing to its expenses her dower or
her personal fortune. Although the Romans gave their daughters an education relatively advanced,
they never forgot to inculcate in them the idea that it was the duty of a woman, especially
if she was nobly born, to know all the arts of good housewifery, and especially, as most important,
spinning and weaving.  The reason for this lay in the fact that for the aristocratic families,
who were in possession of vast lands and many flocks, it was easy to provide themselves from
their own estates with the wool necessary to clothe all their household, from masters to the
numerous retinue of slaves.  If the materfamilias knew sufficiently well the arts of spinning
and weaving to be able to organize in the home a small "factory" of slaves engaged in such
tasks, and knew how to direct and survey them, to make them work with zeal and without theft,
she could provide the clothing for the whole household, thus saving the heavy expense of buying
the stuffs from a merchant--notable economy in times when money was scarce and every family
tried to make as little use of it as possible.  The materfamilias held, then, in every home,
a prime industrial office, that of clothing the entire household, and in proportion to her
usefulness in this office was she able to aid or injure the family.

More important still were the woman's dower and her personal fortune. The Romans not only considered
it perfectly honorable, sagacious, and praiseworthy for a member of the political aristocracy
to marry a rich woman for her wealth, the better to maintain the luster of his rank, or the
more easily to fulfil his particular political and social duties, but they also believed there
could be no better luck or greater honor for a rich woman than for this reason to marry a prominent
man.  They exacted only that she be of respectable habits, and even in this regard it appears
that, during certain tumultuous periods, they sometimes shut one eye.

Tradition says, for example, that Sulla, born of a noble family, quite in ruin, owed his money
to the bequest of a Greek woman whose wealth had the most impure origin that the possessions
of a woman can possibly have.  Is this tradition only the invention of the enemies of the terrible
dictator?  In any event, how people of good standing felt in this matter in normal times is
shown by the life of Cicero.

Cicero was born at Arpino, of a knightly family, highly respectable, and well educated, but
not rich.  That he was able to pursue his brilliant forensic and political career, was chiefly
due to his marriage to Terentia, who, although not very rich, had more than he, and by her
fortune enabled him to live at Rome.  But it is well known that after long living together
happily enough, as far as can be judged, Cicero and Terentia, already old, fell into discord
and in 46 B.C. ended by being divorced.  The reasons for the divorce are not exactly clear,
but from Cicero's letters it appears that financial motives and disputes were not wanting.
It seems that during the civil wars Terentia refused to help Cicero with her money to the extent
he desired; that is to say, at some tremendous moment of those turbulent years she was unwilling
to risk all her patrimony on the uncertain political fortune of her husband.

Cicero's divorce, obliging him to return the dower, reduced him to the gravest straits, from
which he emerged through another marriage.  He was the guardian of an exceedingly rich young
woman, named Publilia, and one fine day, at the age of sixty-three, he joined hands with this
seventeen-year-old girl, whose possessions were to rehabilitate the great writer.

This conception of matrimony and of the family may seem unromantic, prosaic, materialistic;
but we must not suppose that because of it the Romans failed to experience the tenderest and
sweetest affections of the human heart.  The letters of Cicero himself show how tenderly even
Romans could love wife and children.  Although they distrusted and combatted as dangerous to
the prosperity and well-being of the state those dearest and gentlest personal affections that
in our times literature, music, religion, philosophy, and custom have educated, encouraged,
and exalted, as one of the supreme fountains of civil life, should we therefore reckon them
barbarians?  We must not forget the great diversity between our times and theirs.  The confidence
which modern men repose in love as a principle, in its ultimate wisdom, in its beneficial influence
or the affairs of the world; in the idea that every man has the right to choose for himself
the person of the opposite sex toward whom the liveliest and strongest personal attraction
impels him--these are the supreme blossoms of modern individualism, the roots of which have
been able to fasten only in the rich soil of modern civilization.

The great ease of living that we now enjoy, the lofty intellectual development of our day,
permit us to relax the severe discipline that poorer times and peoples, constrained to lead
a harder life, had to impose upon themselves.  Although the habit may seem hard and barbarous,
certainly almost all the great peoples of the past, and the majority of those contemporary
who live outside our civilization, have conceived and practised matrimony not as a right of
sentiment, but as a duty of reason.  To fulfil it, the young have turned to the sagacity of
the aged, and these have endeavored to promote the success of marriage not merely to the satisfaction
of a single passion, usually as brief as it is ardent, but according to a calculated equilibrium
of qualities, tendencies, and material means.

The principles regulating Roman marriage may seem to us at variance with human nature, but
they are the principles to which all peoples wishing to trust the establishment of the family
not to passion as mobile as the sea, but to reason, have had recourse in times when the family
was an organism far more essential than it is to-day, because it held within itself many functions,
educational, industrial, and political, now performed by other institutions.  But reason itself
is not perfect.  Like passion, it has its weakness, and marriage so conceived by Rome produced
grave inconveniences, which one must know in order to understand the story, in many respects
tragic, of the women of the Caesars.

The first difficulty was the early age at which marriages took place among the aristocracy.
The boys were almost always married at from eighteen to twenty; the girls, at from thirteen
to fifteen.  This disadvantage is to be found in all society in which marriage is arranged
by the parents, because it would be next to impossible to induce young people to yield to the
will of their elders in an affair in which the passions are readily aroused if they were allowed
to reach the age when the passions are strongest and the will has become independent Hardly
out of childhood, the man and the woman are naturally more tractable.  On the other hand, it
is easy to see how many dangers threatened such youthful marriages in a society where matrimony
gave to the woman wide liberty, placing her in contact with other men, opening to her the doors
of theaters and public resorts, leading her into the midst of all the temptations and illusions
of life.

The other serious disadvantage was the facility of divorce.  For the very reason that matrimony
was for the nobility a political act, the Romans were never willing to allow that it could
be indissoluble; indeed, even when the woman was in no sense culpable, they reserved to the
man the right of undoing it at any time he wished, solely because that particular marriage
did not suit his political interests.  And the marriage could be dissolved by the most expeditious
means, without formality--by a mere letter!  Nor was that enough.  Fearing that love might
outweigh reason and calculation in the young, the law granted to the father the right to give
notice of divorce to the daughter-in-law, instead of leaving it to the son; so that the father
was able to make and unmake the marriages of his sons, as he thought useful and fitting, without
taking their will into account.

The woman, therefore, although in the home she was of sovereign equality with the man and enjoyed
a position full of honor, was, notwithstanding, never sure of the future.  Neither the affection
of her husband nor the stainlessness of her life could insure that she should close her days
in the house whither she had come in her youth as a bride.  At any hour the fatalities of politics
could, I will not say, drive her forth, but gently invite her exit from the house where her
children were born.  An ordinary letter was enough to annul a marriage. So it was that, particularly
in the age of Caesar when politics were much perturbed and shifting, there were not a few women
of the aristocracy who had changed husbands three or four times, and that not for lightness
or caprice or inconstancy of tastes, but because their fathers, their brothers, sometimes their
sons, had at a certain moment besought or constrained them to contract some particular marriage
that should serve their own political ends.

It is easy to comprehend how this precariousness discouraged woman from austere and rigorous
virtues, the very foundation of the family; how it was a continuous incitement to frivolity
of character, to dissipation, to infidelity.  Consequently, the liberty the Romans allowed
her must have been much more dangerous than the greater freedom she enjoys today, since it
lacked its modern checks and balances, such as personal choice in marriage, the relatively
mature age at which marriages are nowadays made, the indissolubility of the matrimonial contract,
or, rather, the many and diverse restrictions placed upon divorce, by which it is no longer
left to the arbitrary will or the mere fancy of the man.

In brief, there was in the constitution of the Roman family a contradiction, which must be
well apprehended if one would understand the history of the great ladies of the imperial era.
Rome desired woman in marriage to be the pliable instrument of the interests of the family
and the state, but did not place her under the despotism of customs, of law, and of the will
of man in the way done by all other states that have exacted from her complete self-abnegation.
Instead, it accorded to her almost wholly that liberty, granted with little danger by civilizations
like ours, in which she may live not only for the family, for the state, for the race, but
also for herself.  Rome was unwilling to treat her as did the Greek and Asiatic world, but
it did not on this account give up requiring of her the same total self-abnegation for the
public weal, the utter obliviousness to her own aspirations and passions, in behalf of the race.

This contradiction explains to us one of the fundamental phenomena of the history of Rome--the
deep, tenacious, age-long puritanism of high Roman society.  Puritanism was the chief expedient
by which Rome attempted to solve the contradiction.  That coercion which the Oriental world
had tried to exercise upon woman by segregating her, keeping her ignorant, terrorizing her
with threats and punishments, Rome sought to secure by training.  It inculcated in every way
by means of education, religion, and opinion the idea that she should be pious, chaste, faithful,
devoted alone to her husband and children; that luxury, prodigality, dissoluteness, were horrible
vices, the infamy of which hopelessly degraded all that was best and purest in woman.  It tried
to protect the minds of both men and women from all those influences of art, literature, and
religion which might tend to arouse the personal instinct and the longing for love; and for
a long time it distrusted, withstood, and almost sought to disguise the mythology, the arts,
and the literature of Greece, as well as many of the Asiatic religions, imbued as they were
with an erotic spirit of subtle enticement. Puritanism is essentially an intense effort to
rouse in the mind the liveliest repulsion for certain vices and pleasures, and a violent dread
of them; and Rome made use of it to check and counterbalance the liberty of woman, to impede
and render more difficult the abuses of such liberty, particularly prodigality and dissoluteness.

It is therefore easy to understand how this puritanism was a thing serious, weighty, and terrible,
in Roman life; and how from it could be born the tragedies we have to recount.  It was the
chief means of solving one of the gravest problems that has perplexed all civilizations--the
problem of woman and her freedom, a problem earnest, difficult, and complex which springs up
everywhere out of the unobstructed anarchy and the tremendous material prosperity of the modern
world.  And the difficulty of the problem consists, above all, in this: that, although it is
a hard, cruel, plainly iniquitous thing to deprive a woman of liberty and subject her to a
régime of tyranny in order to constrain her to live for the race and not for herself, yet when
liberty is granted her to live for herself, to satisfy her personal desires, she abuses that
liberty more readily than a man does, and more than a man forgets her duties toward the race.

She abuses it more readily for two reasons: because she exercises a greater power over man
than he over her; and because, in the wealthier classes, she is freer from the political and
economic responsibilities that bind the man.  However unbridled the freedom that man enjoys,
however vast his egoism, he is always constrained in a certain measure to check his selfish
instincts by the need of conserving, enlarging, and defending against rivals his social, economic,
and political situation.

But the woman?  If she is freed from family cares, if she is authorized to live for her own
gratification and for her beauty; if the opinion that imposes upon her, on pain of infamy,
habits pure and honest, weakens; if, instead of infamy, dissoluteness brings her glory, riches,
homage, what trammel can still restrain in her the selfish instincts latent in every human
being?  She runs the mighty danger of changing into an irresponsible being who will be the
more admired and courted and possessed of power--at least as long as her beauty lasts--the
more she ignores every duty, subordinating all good sense to her own pleasure.

This is the reason why woman, in periods commanded by strong social discipline, is the most
beneficent and tenacious among the cohesive forces of a nation; and why, in times when social
discipline is relaxed, she is, instead, through ruinous luxury, dissipation, and voluntary
sterility, the most terrible force for dissolution.

One of the greatest problems of every epoch and all civilizations is to find a balance between
the natural aspiration for freedom that is none other than the need of personal felicity--a
need as lively and profound in the heart of woman as of man--and the supreme necessity for
a discipline without which the race, the state, and the family run the gravest danger.  Yet
this problem to-day, in the unmeasured exhilaration with which riches and power intoxicate
the European-American civilization, is considered with the superficial frivolity and the voluble
dilettantism that despoil or confuse all the great problems of esthetics, philosophy, statesmanship,
and morality. We live in the midst of what might be called the Saturnalia of the world's history;
and in the midst of the swift and easy labor, the inebriety of our continual festivities, we
feel no more the tragic in life.  This short history of the women of the Caesars will set before
the eyes of this pleasure-loving contemporary age tragedies among whose ruins our ancestors
lived from birth to death, and by which they tempered their minds.

II

LIVIA AND JULIA

In the year 38 B.C. it suddenly became known at Rome that C. Julius Caesar Octavianus (afterward
the Emperor Augustus), one of the triumvirs of the republic, and colleague of Mark Antony and
Lepidus in the military dictatorship established after the death of Caesar, had sent up for
decision to the pontifical college, the highest religious authority of the state, a curious
question.  It was this: Might a divorced woman who was expecting to become a mother contract
a marriage with another man before the birth of her child?  The pontifical college replied
that if there still was doubt about the fact the new marriage would not be permissible; but
if it was certain, there would be no impediment.  A few days later, it was learned that Octavianus
had divorced his wife Scribonia and had married Livia, a young woman of nineteen.  Livia's
physical condition was precisely that concerning which the pontiffs had been asked to decide,
and in order to enter into this marriage she had obtained a divorce from Tiberius Claudius Nero.

The two divorces and the new marriage were concluded with unwonted haste.  The first husband
of Livia, acting the part of a father, gave her a dowry for her new alliance and was present
at the wedding.  Thus Livia suddenly passed into the house of her new husband where, three
months later, she gave birth to a son, who was called Drusus Claudius Nero.  This child Octavianus
immediately sent to the house of its father.

To us, marriage customs of this sort seem brutal, shameless, and almost ridiculous.  We should
infer that a woman who lent herself to such barter and exchange must be a person of light manners
and of immoral inclinations.  At Rome, however, no one would have been amazed at such a marriage
or at the procedure adopted, had it not been for the extraordinary haste, which seemed to indicate
that it was undesirable or impossible to wait until Livia should have given birth to her child,
and which made it necessary to trouble the pontifical college for its somewhat sophistical
consent.  For all were accustomed to seeing the marriages of great personages made and unmade
in this manner and on such bases.  Why, then, were these nuptials so precipitately concluded,
apparently with the consent of all concerned?  Why did they all, Livia and Octavianus not less
than Tiberius Claudius Nero, seem so impatient that everything should be settled with despatch?

The legend which then formed about the family of Augustus, a legend hostile at almost every
point, has interpreted this marriage as a tyrannical act, virtually an abduction, by the dissolute
and perverse triumvir.  I, too, in my "Greatness and Decline of Rome" expressed my belief that
this haste, at least, was the effect not of political motives but of a passionate love inspired
in the young triumvir by the very beautiful Livia.  A longer reflection upon this episode has
persuaded me, however, that there is another manner, less poetic perhaps, but more Roman, of
explaining, at least in part, this famous alliance, which was to have so great an importance
in the history of Rome.

To arrive at the motives of this marriage we must consider who was Livia and who was Octavianus.
Livia was a woman of great beauty, as her portraits prove.  But this was not all.  She belonged
also to two of the most ancient and conspicuous families of the Roman nobility. Her father,
Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, was by birth a Claudius, adopted by a Livius Drusus.  He was
descended from Appius the Blind, the famous censor and perhaps the most illustrious personage
of the ancient republic.  His grandfather, his great-grand-father, and his great-great-grandfather
had been consuls, and consuls and censors may be found in the collateral branches of the family.
A sister of his grandfather had been the wife of Tiberius Gracchus; a cousin of his father
had married Lucullus, the great general.  He came, therefore, of one of the most ancient and
glorious families.  Not less noble was the family of the Livii Drusi who had adopted him. 
It counted eight consulships, two censorships, three triumphs, and one dictatorship. Thus the
father of Livia belonged by birth and adoption to two of those ancient, aristocratic families
which for a long time and even in the midst of the most tremendous revolutions the people had
venerated as semi-divine and into whose story was interwoven the history of the great republic.
Nor had the first husband given to Livia been less noble, for Tiberius Claudius Nero was descended
like Livia from Appius the Blind, though through another son of the great censor.  In Livia
was concentrated the quintessence of the great Roman aristocracy: she was at Rome what in London
to-day the daughter of the Duke of Westminster or the Duke of Bedford would be, and her noble
rank explains the rôle which her family had played during the Civil War.  In the great revolution
which broke out after the death of Caesar, the father of Livia in the year 43 had been proscribed
by the triumvirs; he had fought with Brutus and Cassius and had died by his own hand after
Philippi.  In 40, after the Perusinian war and only two years before Livia's marriage with
Octavianus, Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia had been forced to flee from Italy in fear of
the vengeance of Octavianus.

Who on the other hand was Octavianus?  A parvenu, with a nobility altogether too recent!  His
grandfather was a rich usurer of Velitrae (now Velletri), a financier and a man of affairs;
it was only his immediate father who succeeded by dint of the riches of the usurer grandfather
in entering the Roman nobility.  He had married a sister of Caesar and, though still young
when he died, had become a senator and pretor.  Octavianus was, therefore, the descendant,
as we should express it in Europe to-day, of rich bourgeois recently ennobled. Although by
adopting him in his will Caesar had given him his name, that of an ancient patrician family,
the modest origin of Octavianus and the trade of his grandfather were known to everybody. 
In a country like Rome where, notwithstanding revolutions, the old nobility was still highly
venerated by the people and formed a closed caste, jealous of its exclusive pride of ancestry,
this obscurity of origin was a handicap and a danger, especially when Octavianus had as colleagues
Antony and Lepidus, who could boast a much more ancient and illustrious origin than his own.

We can readily explain, therefore, even without admitting that Livia had aroused in him a violent
passion, why the future Augustus should have been so impatient to marry her in 38 B.C.  The
times were stormy and uncertain; the youthful triumvir, whom a caprice of fortune had raised
to the head of a revolutionary dictatorship, was certainly the weakest of the three colleagues,
because of his youth, his slighter experience, the feebler prestige among his soldiers, and,
last of all, the greater obscurity of his lineage.  Antony, especially, who had fought in so
many wars, with Caesar and alone, who belonged to a family of really ancient nobility, was
much more popular than he among the soldiers and had stronger relations with the great families.
He was therefore more powerful than Octavianus both in high places and in low. A marriage with
Livia meant much to the future Augustus.  It would open for him a door into the old aristocracy;
it would draw him closer to those families which, in spite of the revolution, were still so
influential and venerable; it would be the means of lessening the hatred, contempt, and distrust
in which these families held him.  It was for him what Napoleon's marriage with Marie Louise
and the consequent connection with the imperial family of Austria had been for the former Corsican
officer, become Emperor of the French.  Since, now, a lady who belonged to one of these great
families was disposed to marry him, it would have been foolish to put obstacles in the way;
it was necessary to act with despatch; time and fortune might change.

Such are the motives that may have induced Augustus to hasten the nuptials.  But what were
the motives of Livia in accepting this marriage, in such stormy times, when the fortunes of
the future Augustus were still so uncertain?  A passage in Velleius Paterculus would lead us
to believe that he who devised this historic marriage was none other than that same first husband
of Livia, Tiberius Claudius Nero himself!  According to our ideas it is inconceivable; but
not at all strange according to the ideas of the Roman.  It is probable that Tiberius Claudius
Nero, feeling that the triumph of the revolution was now assured, had wished by this marriage
to attach to the cause of the old aristocracy the youngest of the three revolutionary leaders.
Already well along in years and infirm,--he was to die shortly after,--Nero, who well knew
the intelligence of his young wife, was perhaps planning to place her in the house of the man
in whom all saw one of the future lords of Rome.  Thus he would bind him to the interests of
the aristocracy.  In the person of Livia there entered into the house of Octavianus the old
Roman nobility, which, defeated at Philippi, was striving to reacquire through the prestige
and the cleverness of a woman what it had not been able to maintain by arms.

All her life long, with constancy, moderation, and wonderful tact, Livia fulfilled her mission.
She succeeded in resolving into the admirable harmony of a long existence that contradiction
between the liberty conceded to her sex and the self-denial demanded of it by man as a duty.
She was assuredly one of the most perfect models of that lady of high society whom the Romans
in all the years of their long and tempestuous history never ceased to admire.  Even and serene,
completely mistress of herself and of her passions, endowed with a robust will, she accommodated
herself without difficulty to all the sacrifices which her rank and situation imposed upon
her.  She changed husbands without repugnance, though her marriage to Octavianus occurred but
five years after the proscriptions, while he was still red with the blood of her family and
friends.  Likewise she renounced her two sons, the future emperor Tiberius, who had been born
before her second marriage, as well as the one who had been born after.  So too when, a few
years later, Tiberius Claudius Nero died, appointing Augustus their guardian, with equal serenity
she took them back and educated them with the most careful motherly solicitude.  To the second
husband, whom politics had given her, she was a faithful companion.  Scandal imputed to her
absurd poisonings which she did not commit, and accused her of insatiable ambitions and perfidious
intrigues.  No one ever dared accuse her of infidelity to Augustus or of dissolute conduct.
The great fame, power, and wealth of her husband did not disturb the calm poise of her spirit.
In that palace of Augustus, adorned with triumphal laurel, toward which the eyes of the subjects
were turned from every part of the empire, in that palace where, in little councils with the
most eminent men of the senate, were debated the supreme interests of the world,--laws and
elections, wars and peace,--she preserved the beautiful traditions of simplicity and industry.
These she had learned as a child in the house of her father,--a house as much more illustrious
with inherited glory as it was poorer in wealth than that which Victory had prepared for Augustus
on the Palatine.

We know--it is Suetonius who tells us--that this house on the Palatine built by Augustus, in
which Livia spent the larger part of her life, was small and not at all luxurious.  In it there
was not a single piece of marble nor a precious mosaic; for forty years Augustus slept in the
same bedchamber, and the furniture of the house was so simple that in the second century of
our era it was exhibited to the public as an extraordinary curiosity.  The imperial pair had
several villas, at Lanuvium, at Palestrina, at Tivoli, but all of them were unpretentious and
simple.  Nor was there any more pomp and ceremony about the dinners to which they invited the
conspicuous personages of Rome, the dignitaries of the state and the heads of the great families.
Only on very special occasions were six courses served; usually there were but three.  Moreover,
Augustus never wore any other togas than those woven by Livia; woven not indeed and altogether
by Livia's hands,--though she did not disdain, now and then, to work the loom,--but by her
slaves and freed-women.  Faithful to the traditions of the aristocracy, Livia counted it among
her duties personally to direct the weaving-rooms which were in the house.  As she carefully
parceled out the wool to the slaves, watching over them lest they steal or waste it, and frequently
taking her place among them while they were at work, she felt that she too contributed to the
prosperity and the glory of the empire.

Simplicity, loyalty, industry, an absolute surrender of one's own personality to the family
and its interests,--these, in the great families, were the traditional feminine virtues which
lived again in Livia to the admiration of her contemporaries.  But with these virtues were
associated also the need and the pride of participating in the affairs and work of her husband,
that interest in politics which had been common to the intelligent women of the nobility. 
No one at Rome was astonished, especially in the upper classes, that Livia should occupy herself
actively with politics; that Augustus should frequently come to her for counsel, or that he
should not make any serious decision without having consulted her; that, in short, she should
at the same time attend to her husband's clothes and aid him in governing the empire.  For
so had done from time immemorial all the great ladies of the aristocracy, mindful of their
good repute and the prosperity of their families.  And Livia must have tried the more earnestly
to fulfil all that her education had taught her to consider a sacred duty, since to a woman
of her old-fashioned breeding the times must have appeared especially difficult and perilous.

The civil wars had greatly reduced in numbers the historic aristocracy of Rome, and the peace
which followed after so long a time and which had been so anxiously invoked, very soon began
to threaten the prosperity of the remnant of that nobility with a more insidious but more inevitable
ruin.  About 18 B.C., when Livia was approaching her fortieth year, the men of the new generation
who had not seen the civil wars, for when these ended they were either unborn or only in their
infancy, were already beginning to come to the front.  They brought with them a previously
unknown spirit of luxury, of enjoyment, of dissipation, of rebellion against discipline, of
egotism and fondness for the new, which rendered very difficult, not to say impossible, the
continuation of the aristocratic régime.  Women submitted with more and more repugnance to
those obligatory marriages, arranged for reasons of state, which had formerly been the tradition
and the sure bulwark of dominion for the aristocracy.  The increase of celibacy was rendering
sterile the most celebrated stocks; the most lamentable vices and disorders became tolerated
and common in the most illustrious families, and ruinous habits of extravagance spread generally
among that aristocracy, once so simple and austere.  All this had grown up after the conquest
of Egypt, which had established more points of contact with the East; and it increased in proportion
as those industries and the commerce in articles of luxury which had flourished at Alexandria
under the Ptolemies were gradually transplanted to Rome, where the merchants hoped to establish
among their conquerors the clientele which had been lost with the fall of the Kingdom of the
Nile.  The ladies especially took up with the new oriental customs, and, preferring expensive
stuffs and jewels, turned from the loom, which Livia had wished to preserve as the emblem of
womanhood.  Many young men of the great families were beginning to show a distaste for the
army, for the government of the state, for jurisprudence, for all those activities which had
been the jealous privilege of the nobility of the past.  One gave himself up to literary pursuits,
another cultivated philosophy, another busied himself only with the increase of his inherited
fortune, while another lived only in pleasure and idleness.  So it happened that there began
to appear descendants of great houses who refused to be senators; every year an effort had
to be made to find a sufficient number of candidates for the more numerous positions like the
questorship, and in the army it was no easy matter to fill all the posts of the superior officers
which were reserved for members of the nobility.

  He lived
in a separate apartment, keeping up with Julia only the relations necessary to save appearances,
but he could not divorce her, much less publish her guilt.  The situation grew still worse
when political discontent began to use for its own ends the discord between Julia and Tiberius.
Tiberius had many enemies among the nobility, especially among the young men of his own age;
partly because his rapid, brilliant career had aroused much jealousy, partly because his conservative,
traditionalist tendencies toward authority and militarism disturbed many of them.  More and
more among the nobility there was increasing the desire for a mild and easy-going government
which should allow them to enjoy their privileges without hardship and which should not be
too severe in imposing its duties upon them.

On the other hand, Julia was most ambitious.  Since, after the disagreements with Tiberius
had broken out, she could no longer hope to be the powerful wife of the first person of the
empire after Augustus, she sought compensation.  Thus there formed about Julia a party which
sought in every way to ruin the lofty position which Tiberius occupied in the state, by setting
up against him Caius Caesar, the son of Julia by Agrippa, whom Augustus had adopted and of
whom he was very fond.  In 6 B.C., Caius Caesar was only fourteen years old, but at that period
an agitation was set on foot whereby, through a special privilege conceded to him by the senate,
he was to be named consul for the year of Rome 754, when Caius should have reached twenty.
This was a manoeuver of the Julian party to attract popular attention to the youth, to prepare
a rival for Tiberius in his quality as principal collaborator of Augustus, and to gain a hold
upon the future head of the state.

The move was altogether very bold; for this nomination of a child consul contradicted all the
fundamental principles of the Roman constitution, and it would probably have been fatal to
the party which evolved it, had not the indignant rage of Tiberius assured its triumph. Tiberius
opposed this law, which he took as an offense, and he wished Augustus to oppose it, and at
the outset Augustus did so.  But then, either because Julia was able to bend him to her desires
or because in the senate there was in truth a strong party which supported it out of hatred
for Tiberius, Augustus at last yielded, seeking to placate Tiberius with other compensations.
But Tiberius was too proud and violent an aristocrat to accept compensations and indignantly
demanded permission to retire to Rhodes, abandoning all the public offices which he exercised.
He certainly hoped to make his loss felt, for indeed Rome needed him.  But he was mistaken.
This act of Tiberius was severely judged by public opinion as a reprisal upon the public for
a private offense.  Augustus became angry with him and in his absence all his enemies took
courage and hurled themselves against him.  The honors to Caius Caesar were approved amid general
enthusiasm and the Julian party triumphed all along the line; it reached the height of power
and popularity, while Tiberius was constrained to content himself with the idle life of a private
person at Rhodes.

But at Rome Livia still remained.  From that moment began the mortal duel between Livia and Julia.

III

THE DAUGHTERS OF AGRIPPA

Tiberius had now broken with Augustus, he had lost the support of public opinion, he was hated
by the majority of the senate.  At Rhodes he soon found himself, therefore, in the awkward
position of one who through a false move has played into the hands of his enemies and sees
no way of recovering his position.  It had been easy to leave Rome; to reënter it was difficult,
and in all probability his fortune would have been forever compromised, and he would never
have become emperor, had it not been for the fact that in the midst of this general defection
two women remained faithful.  They were his mother, Livia, and his sister-in-law, Antonia,
the widow of that brother Drusus who, dying in his youth, had carried to his grave the hopes
of Rome.

Antonia was the daughter of the emperor's sister Octavia and of Mark Antony, the famous triumvir
whose name remains forever linked in story with that of Cleopatra.  This daughter of Antony
was certainly the noblest and the gentlest of all the women who appear in the lugubrious and
tragic history of the family of the Caesars.  Serious, modest, and even-tempered, she was likewise
endowed with beauty and virtue, and she brought into the family and into its struggles a spirit
of concord, serenity of mind, and sweet reasonableness, though they could not always prevail
against the violent passions and clashing interests of those about her.  As long as Drusus
lived, Drusus and Antonia had been for the Romans the model of the devoted pair of lovers,
and their tender affection had become proverbial; yet the Roman multitude, always given to
admiring the descendants of the great families, was even more deeply impressed by the beauty,
the virtue, the sweetness, the modesty, and the reserve of Antonia.  After the death of Drusus,
she did not wish to marry again, even though the Lex de maritandis ordinibus made it a duty.
"Young and beautiful," wrote Valerius Maximus, "she withdrew to a life of retirement in the
company of Livia, and the same bed which had seen the death of the youthful husband saw his
faithful spouse grow old in an austere widowhood."  Augustus and the people were so touched
by this supreme proof of fidelity to the memory of the ever-cherished husband that by the common
consent of public opinion she was relieved of the necessity of remarrying; and Augustus himself,
who had always carefully watched over the observance of the marital law in his own family,
did not dare insist.  Whether living at her villa of Bauli, where she spent the larger part
of her year, or at Rome, the beautiful widow gave her attention to the bringing up of her three
children, Germanicus, Livilla, and Claudius.  Ever since the death of Octavia, she had worshiped
Livia as a mother and lived in the closest intimacy with her, and, withdrawn from public life,
she attempted now to bring a spirit of peace into the torn and tragic family.

Antonia was very friendly with Tiberius, who, on his side, felt the deepest sympathy and respect
for his beautiful and virtuous sister-in-law.  It cannot be doubted, therefore, that in this
crisis Antonia, who was bound to Livia by many ties, must have taken sides for Livia's son
Tiberius.  But Antonia was too gentle and mild to lead a faction in the struggle which during
these years began between the friends and the enemies of Tiberius, and that rôle was assumed
by Livia, who possessed more strength and more authority.

The situation grew worse and worse.  Public opinion steadily became more hostile to Tiberius
and more favorable to Julia and her elder son, and it was not long before they wished to give
to her younger son, Lucius, the same honors which had already been bestowed upon his brother
Caius.  Private interest soon allied itself with the hatred and rancor against Tiberius; and
scarcely had he departed when the senate increased the appropriation for public supplies and
public games.  All those who profited by these appropriations were naturally interested in
preventing the return of Tiberius, who was notorious for his opposition to all useless expenditures.
Any measure, however dishonest, was therefore considered proper, provided only it helped to
ruin Tiberius; and his enemies had recourse to every art and calumny, among other things actually
accusing him of conspiracies against Augustus.  Even for a woman as able and energetic as Livia
it was an arduous task to struggle against the inclinations of Augustus, against public opinion,
against the majority of the senate, against private interest, and against Julia and her friends.
Indeed, four years passed during which the situation of Tiberius and his party grew steadily
worse, while the party of Julia increased in power.

Finally the party of Tiberius resolved to attempt a startlingly bold move.  They decided to
cripple the opposition by means of a terrible scandal in the very person of Julia.  The Lex
Julia de adulteriis, framed by Augustus in the year 18, authorized any citizen to denounce
an unfaithful wife before the judges, if the husband and father should both refuse to make
the accusation.  This law, which was binding upon all Roman citizens, was therefore applicable
even to the daughter of Augustus, the widow of Agrippa, the mother of Caius and Lucius Caesar,
those two youths in whom were centered the hopes of the republic.  She had violated the Lex
Julia and she had escaped the penalties which had been visited on many other ladies of the
aristocracy only because no one had dared to call down this scandal upon the first family of
the empire.  The party of Tiberius, protected and guided by Livia, at last hazarded this step.

It is impossible to say what part Livia played in this terrible tragedy.  It is certain that
either she or some other influential personage succeeded in gaining possession of the proofs
of Julia's guilt and brought them to Augustus, threatening to lay them before the pretor and
to institute proceedings if he did not discharge his duty. Augustus found himself constrained
to apply to himself his own terrible law.  He himself had decreed that if the husband, as was
then the case of Tiberius, could not accuse a faithless woman, the father must do so. It was
his law, and he had to bow to it in order to avoid scandals and worse consequences.  He exiled
Julia to the little island of Pandataria, and at the age of thirty-seven the brilliant, pleasing,
and voluptuous young woman who had dazzled Rome for many years was compelled to disappear from
the metropolis forever and retire to an existence on a barren island.  She was cut off by the
implacable hatred of a hostile party and by the inexorable cruelty of a law framed by her own
father!

The exile of Julia marks the moment when the fortunes of Tiberius and Livia, which had been
steadily losing ground for four years, began to revive, though not so rapidly as Livia and
Tiberius had probably expected.  Julia preserved, even in her misfortune, many faithful friends
and a great popularity.  For a long time popular demonstrations were held in her favor at Rome,
and many busied themselves tenaciously to obtain her pardon from Augustus, all of which goes
to prove that the horrible infamies which were spread about her were the inventions of enemies.
Julia had broken the Lex Julia,--so much is certain,--but even if she had been guilty of an
unfortunate act, she was not a monster, as her enemies wished to have it believed.  She was
a beautiful woman, as there had been before, as there are now, and as there will be hereafter,
touched with human vices and with human virtues.

As a matter of fact, her party, after it had recovered from the terrible shock of the scandal,
quickly reorganized.  Firm in its intention of having Julia pardoned, it took up the struggle
again, and tried as far as it could to hinder Tiberius from returning to Rome and again taking
part in political life, knowing well that if the husband once set foot in Rome, all hope of
Julia's return would be lost.  Only one of them could reënter Rome.  It was either Tiberius
or Julia; and more furiously than ever the struggle between the two parties was waged about
Augustus.

Caius and Lucius Caesar, Julia's two youthful sons, of whom Augustus was very fond, were the
principal instruments with which the enemies of Tiberius fought against the influence of Livia
over Augustus.  Every effort was made to sow hatred and distrust between the two youths and
Tiberius, to the end that it might become impossible to have them collaborate with him in the
government of the empire, and that the presence of Julia's sons should of necessity exclude
that of her husband.  A further ally was soon found in the person of another child of Julia
and Agrippa, the daughter who has come down into history under the name of the Younger Julia.
Augustus had conceived as great a love for her as for the two sons, and there was no doubt
that she would aid with every means in her power the party averse to Tiberius; for her mother's
instincts of liberty, luxury, and pleasure were also inherent in her.  Married to L. Aemilius
Paulus, the son of one of the greatest Roman families, she had early assumed in Rome a position
which made her, like her mother, the antithesis of Livia.  She, too, gathered about her, as
the elder Julia had done, a court of elegant youths, men of letters, and poets,--Ovid was of
the number,--and with this group she hoped to be able to hold the balance of power in the government
against that coterie of aged senators who paid court to Livia.  She, too, took advantage of
the good-will of her grandfather, just as her mother had done, and in the shadow of his protection
she displayed an extravagance which the laws did not permit, but which, on this account, was
all the more admired by the enemies of the old Roman Puritanism. As though openly to defy the
sumptuary law of Augustus, she built herself a magnificent villa; and, if we dare believe tradition,
it was not long before she, too, had violated the very law which had proved disastrous to her
mother.

Thus, even after the departure of Julia, her three children, Caius, Lucius, and Julia the Younger,
constituted in Rome an alliance which was sufficiently powerful to contest every inch of ground
with the party of Livia; for they had public opinion in their favor, they enjoyed the support
of the senate, and they played upon the weakness of Augustus.  In the year 2 A.D., after four
years of exhaustive efforts spent in struggle and intrigue, all that Livia had been able to
obtain was the mere permission that Tiberius might return to Rome, under the conditions, however,
that he retire to private life, that he give himself up to the education of his son, and that
he in no wise mingle in public affairs.  The condition of the empire was growing worse on every
side; the finances were disordered, the army was disorganized, and the frontiers were threatened,
for revolt was raising its head in Gaul, in Pannonia, and especially in Germany.  Every day
the situation seemed to demand the hand of Tiberius, who, now in the prime of life, was recognized
as one of the leading administrators and the first general of the empire.  But, for all Livia's
insistence, Augustus refused to call Tiberius back into the government.  The Julii were masters
of the state, and held the Claudii at a distance.

Perhaps Tiberius would never have returned to power in Rome had not chance aided him in the
sudden taking off, in a strange and unforeseen manner, of Caius and Lucius Caesar.  The latter
died at Marseilles, following a brief illness, shortly after the return of Tiberius to Rome,
August 29, in the year 2 A.D.  It was a great grief to Augustus, and, twenty months after,
was followed by another still more serious. In February of the year 4, Caius also died, in
Lycia, of a wound received in a skirmish.  These two deaths were so premature, so close to
each other, and so opportune for Tiberius, that posterity has refused to see in them simply
one of the many mischances of life. Later generations have tried to believe that Livia had
a hand in these fatalities.  Yet he who understands life at all knows that it is easier to
imagine and suspect romantic poisonings of this sort than it is to carry them out.  Even leaving
the character of Livia out of consideration, it is difficult to imagine how she would have
dared, or have been able, to poison the two youths at so great a distance from Rome, one in
Asia, the other in Gaul, by means of a long train of accomplices, and this at a moment when
the family of Augustus was divided by many hatreds and every member was suspected, spied upon,
and watched by a hostile party.  Furthermore, it would have been necessary to carry this out
at a time when the example of Julia proved to all that relationship to Augustus was not a sufficient
defense against the rigors of the law and the severity of public opinion when roused by any
serious crime.  Besides, it is a recognized fact that people are always inclined to suspect
a crime whenever a man prominent in the public eye dies before his time.  At Turin, for example,
there still lives a tradition among the people that Cavour was poisoned, some say by the order
of Napoleon III, others by the Jesuits, simply because his life was suddenly cut off, at the
age of fifty-two, at the moment when Italy had greatest need of him.  Indeed, even to-day we
are impressed when we see in the family of Augustus so many premature deaths of young men;
but precisely because these untimely deaths are frequent we come to see in them the predestined
ruin of a worn-out race in history.  All ancient families at a certain moment exhaust themselves.
This is the reason why no aristocracy has been able to endure for long unless continually renewed,
and why all those that have refused to take in new blood have failed from the face of the earth.
There is no serious reason for attributing so horrible a crime to a woman who was venerated
by the best men of her time; and the fables which the populace, always faithful to Julia, and
therefore hostile to Livia, recounted on this score, and which the historians of the succeeding
age collected, have no decisive value.

The deaths of Caius and Lucius Caesar were therefore a great good fortune for Tiberius, because
it determined his return to power.  The situation of the empire was growing worse on every
hand; Germany was in the midst of revolt, and it was necessary to turn the army over to vigorous
hands.  Augustus, old and irresolute, still hesitated, fearing the dislike which was brewing
both in the senate and among the people against the too dictatorial Tiberius.  At last, however,
he was forced to yield.

The more serious, more authoritative, more ancient party of the senatorial nobility, in accord
with Livia and headed by a nephew of Pompey, Cnaeus Cornelius Cinna, forced him to recall Tiberius,
threatening otherwise to have recourse to some violent measures the exact character of which
we do not know.  The unpopularity of Tiberius was a source of continual misgivings to the aging
Augustus, and it was only through this threat of a yet greater danger that they finally overcame
his hesitation.  On June 26, in the fourth year of our era, Augustus adopted Tiberius as his
son, and had conferred upon him for ten years the office of tribune, thus making him his colleague.
Tiberius returned to power, and, in accordance with the wishes of Augustus, adopted as his
son Germanicus, the elder son of Drusus and Antonia, his faithful friend.  He was an intelligent,
active lad of whom all entertained the highest hopes.

On his return to power, Tiberius, together with Augustus, took measures for reorganizing the
army and the state, and sought to bring about by means of new marriages and acts of clemency
a closer union between the Julian and Claudian branches of the family, then bitterly divided
by the violent struggles of recent years.  The terms of Julia's exile were made easier; Germanicus
married Agrippina, another daughter of Julia and Agrippa, and a sister of Julia the Younger;
the widow of Caius Caesar, Livilla, sister of Germanicus and daughter of Antonia, was given
to Drusus, the son of Tiberius, a young man born in the same year as Germanicus.  Drusus, despite
certain defects, such as irascibility and a marked fondness for pleasure, gave evidence that
he possessed the requisite qualities of a statesman--firmness, sound judgment, and energy.
The policy which dictated these marriages was always the same--to make of the family of Augustus
one formidable and united body, so that it might constitute the solid base of the entire government
of the empire.  But, alas! wise as were the intentions, the ferments of discord and the unhappiness
of the times prevailed against them.  Too much had been hoped for in recalling Tiberius to
power.  During the ten years of senile government, the empire had been reduced to a state of
utter disorder.  The measures planned by Tiberius for reestablishing the finances of the state
roused the liveliest discontent among the wealthy classes in Italy, and again excited their
hatred against him. In the year 6 A.D., the great revolt of Pannonia broke out and for a moment
filled Italy with unspeakable terror.  In an instant of mob fury, they even came to fear that
the peninsula would be invaded and Rome besieged by the barbarians of the Danube.  Tiberius
came to the rescue, and with patience and coolness put down the insurrection, not by facing
it in open conflict, but by drawing out the war to such a length as to weary the enemy, a method
both safe and wise, considering the unreliable character of the troops at his command.  But
at Rome, once the fear had subsided, the long duration of the war became a new cause for dissatisfaction
and anger, and offered to many a pretext for venting their long-cherished hatred against Tiberius,
who was accused of being afraid, of not knowing how to end the war, and of drawing it out for
motives of personal ambition.  The party averse to Tiberius again raised its head and resorted
once more to its former policy--that of urging on Germanicus against Tiberius.  The former
was young, ambitious, bold, and would have preferred daring strokes and a war quickly concluded.
It is certain that there would have risen then and there a Germanican and a Tiberian party,
if Augustus, on this occasion, had not energetically sustained Tiberius from Rome.  But the
situation again became strained and full of uncertainty.

In the midst of these conflicts and these fears, a new scandal broke out in the family of Augustus.
The Younger Julia, like her mother, allowed herself to be caught in violation of the Lex Julia
de adulteriis, and she also was compelled to take the road of exile.  In what manner and at
whose instance the scandal was disclosed we do not know; we do know, however, that Augustus
was very fond of his granddaughter, whence we can assume that in this moment of turbid agitation,
when so much hatred was directed against his family and his house, and when so many forces
were uniting to overthrow Tiberius again, notwithstanding the fact that he had saved the empire,
Augustus felt that he must a second time submit to his own law.  He did not dare contend with
the puritanical party, with the more conservative minority in the senate,--the friends of Tiberius,--over
this second victim in his family.  Without a doubt everything possible was done to hush up
the scandal, and there would scarcely have come down to us even a summary notice of the exile
of the second Julia had it not been that among those exiled with her was the poet Ovid, who
was to fill twenty centuries with his laments and to bring them to the ears of the latest generations.

Ovid's exile is one of those mysteries of history which has most keenly excited the curiosity
of the ages.  Ovid himself, without knowing it, has rendered it more acute by his prudence
in not speaking more clearly of the cause of his exile, making only rare allusions to it, which
may be summed up in his famous words, carmen et error.  It is for this reason that posterity
has for twenty centuries been asking itself what was this error which sent the exquisite poet
away to die among the barbarous Getae on the frozen banks of the Danube; and naturally they
have never compassed his secret.  But if, therefore, it is impossible to say exactly what the
error was which cost Ovid so dearly, it is possible, on the other hand, to explain that unique
and famous episode in the history of Rome to which, after all, Ovid owes a great part of his
immortality.  He was not the victim, as has been too often repeated, of a caprice of despotism;
and therefore he cannot be compared with any of the many Russian writers whom the administration,
through fear and hatred, deports to Siberia without definite reason. Certainly the error of
Ovid lay in his having violated some clause of the Lex Julia de adulteriis, which, as we know,
was so comprehensive in its provisions that it considered as accessories to the crime those
guilty of various acts and deeds which, judged even with modern rigor and severity, would seem
reprehensible, to be sure, but not deserving of such terrible punishment.  Ovid was certainly
involved under one of these clauses,--which one we do not, and never shall, know,--but his
error, whether serious or light, was not the true cause of his condemnation.  It was the pretext
used by the more conservative and puritanical part of Roman society to vent upon him a long-standing
grudge the true motives of which lay much deeper.

What was the standing of this poet of the gay, frivolous, exquisite ladies whom they wished
to send into exile?  He was the author of that graceful, erotic poetry who, through the themes
which he chose for his elegant verses, had encouraged the tendencies toward luxury, diversion,
and the pleasures which had transformed the austere matron of a former day into an extravagant
and undisciplined creature given to voluptuousness; the poet who had gained the admiration
of women especially by flattering their most dangerous and perverse tendencies. The puritanical
party hated and combatted this trend of the newer generations, and therefore, also, the poetry
of Ovid on account of its disastrous effects upon the women, whom it weaned from the virtues
most prized in former days--frugality, simplicity, family affection, and purity of life.  The
Roman aristocracy did not recognize the right of absolute literary freedom which is acknowledged
by many modern states, in which writers and men of letters have acquired a strong political
influence.  The theory, held by many countries to-day that any publication is justifiable,
provided it be a work of art, was not accepted by the Romans in power.  On the contrary, they
were convinced that an idea or a sentiment, dangerous in itself, became still more harmful
when artistically expressed.  Therefore Rome had always known the existence of a kind of police
supervision of ideas and of literary forms, exercised through various means by the ruling aristocracy,
and especially in reference to women, who constituted that element of social life in which
virtue and purity of customs are of the greatest consequence.  The Roman ladies of the aristocracy,
as we have seen, received considerable instruction.  They read the poets and philosophers,
and precisely for this reason there was always at Rome a strong aversion to light and immoral
literature.  If books had circulated among men only, the poetry of Ovid would perhaps not have
enjoyed the good fortune of a persecution which was to focus upon it the attention of posterity.
The greater liberty conceded to women thus placed upon society an even greater reserve in the
case of its literature.  This Ovid learned to his cost when he was driven into exile because
his books gave too much delight to too many ladies at Rome.  By the order of Augustus these
books were removed from the libraries, which did not hinder their coming down to us entire,
while many a more serious work--like Livy's history, for example--has been either entirely
or in large part lost.

After the fall of the second Julia up to the time of his death, which occurred August 23, in
the year 14 A.D., Augustus had no further serious griefs over the ladies of his family.  The
great misfortune of the last years of his government was a public misfortune--the defeat of
Varus and the loss of Germany.  But with what sadness must he have looked back in the last
weeks of his long life upon the history of his family!  All those whom he had loved were torn
from him before their time by a cruel destiny: Drusus, Caius, and Lucius Caesar by death; the
Julias by the cruelty of the law and by an infamy worse than death. The unique grandeur to
which he had attained had not brought fortune to his family.  He was old, almost alone, a weary
survivor among the tombs of those dear to him who had been untimely lost through fate, and
with the still sadder memories of those who had been buried in a living grave of infamy.  His
only associates were Tiberius, with whom he had become reconciled; Antonia, his sweet and highly
respected daughter-in-law; and Livia, the woman whom destiny had placed at his side in one
of the most critical moments of his life, the faithful companion through fifty-two years of
his varied and wonderful fortune. We can therefore understand why it was that, as the historians
tell us, the last words of the old emperor should have been a tender expression of gratitude
to his faithful wife.  "Farewell, farewell, Livia! Remember our long union!"  With these words,
rendering homage to the wife whom custom and the law had made the faithful and loving companion,
and not the docile slave, of her husband, he ended his life like a true Roman.

If the family of Augustus had undergone grievous vicissitudes during his life, its situation
became even more dangerous after his death. The historian who sets out with the preconceived
notion that Augustus founded a monarchy, and imagines that his family was destined to enjoy
the privileges which in all monarchies are accorded the sovereign's house, will never arrive
at a complete understanding of the story of the first empire.  His family did, to be sure,
always enjoy a privileged status, if not at law, at least in fact, and through the very force
of circumstances; but it was not for naught that Rome had been for many centuries an aristocratic
republic in which all the families of the nobility had considered themselves equal, and had
been subject to the same laws.  The aristocracy avenged itself upon the imperial family for
the privileges which the lofty dignity of its head assured it by giving it hatred instead of
respect.  They suspected and calumniated all of its members, and with a malicious joy subjected
them, whenever possible, to the common laws and even maltreated with particular ferocity those
who by chance fell under the provisions of any statute.  As a compensation for the privileges
which the royal family enjoyed, they had to assume the risk of receiving the harshest penalties
of the laws.  If any of them, therefore, fell under the rigor of these laws, the senatorial
aristocracy especially was ever eager to enjoy the atrocious satisfaction of seeing one of
the favored tortured as much as or more than the ordinary man.  There is no doubt, for example,
that the two Julias were more severely punished and disgraced than other ladies of the aristocracy
guilty of the same crime.  And Augustus was forced to waive his affection for them in order
that it might not be said, particularly in the senate, that his relatives enjoyed special favors
and that Augustus made laws only for others.

Yet as long as Augustus lived, he was a sufficient protection for his relatives.  He was, especially
in the last twenty years of his life, the object of an almost religious veneration.  The great
and stormy epoch out of which he had risen, the extraordinary fortune which had assisted him,
his long reign, the services both real and imaginary which he had rendered the empire--all
had conferred upon him such an authority that envy laid aside its most poisonous darts before
him. Out of respect for him even his family was not particularly calumniated or maltreated,
save now and then in moments of great irritation, as when the two Julias were condemned.  But
after his death the situation grew considerably worse; for Tiberius, although he was a man
of great capacity and merit, a sagacious administrator and a valiant general, did not enjoy
the sympathy and respect which had been accorded to Augustus.  Rather was he hated by those
who had for a long time sided with Caius and Lucius Caesar and who formed a considerable portion
of the senate and the aristocracy.  It was not the spontaneous admiration of the senate and
of the people, but the exigencies of the situation, which had made him master of the government
when Augustus died.  The empire was at war with the Germans, and the Pannonico-Illyrian provinces
were in revolt, and it was necessary to place at the head of the empire a man who should strike
terror to the hearts of the barbarians and who on occasion should be able to combat them. Tiberius,
furthermore, was so well aware that the majority of the senate and the Roman people would submit
to his government only through force, that he had for a long time been in doubt whether to
accept the empire or not, so completely did he understand that with so many enemies it would
be difficult to rule.

Under the government of Tiberius the imperial family was surrounded by a much more intense
and open hatred than under Augustus.  One couple only proved an exception, Germanicus and Agrippina,
who were very sympathetic to the people.  But right here began the first serious difficulties
for Tiberius.  Germanicus was twenty-nine years old when Tiberius took over the empire, and
about him there began to form a party which by courting and flattering both him and his wife
began to set him up against Tiberius.  In this they were unconsciously aided by Agrippina.
Unlike her sister Julia, she was a lady of blameless life; faithfully in love with her husband;
a true Roman matron, such as tradition had loved; chaste and fruitful, who at the age of twenty-six
had already borne nine children, of whom, however, six had died.  But Agrippina was to show
that in the house of Augustus, in those tumultuous, strange times, virtue was not less dangerous
than vice, though in another way and for different reasons.  She was so proud of her fidelity
to her husband and of the admiration which she aroused at Rome that all the other defects of
her character were exaggerated and increased by her excessive pride in her virtue.  And among
these defects should be counted a great ambition, a kind of harum-scarum and tumultuous activity,
an irreflective impetuosity of passion, and a dangerous lack of balance and judgment.  Agrippina
was not evil; she was ambitious, violent, intriguing, imprudent, and thoughtless, and therefore
could easily adapt her own feelings and interests to what seemed expedient.  She had much influence
over her husband, whom she accompanied upon all his journeys; and out of the great love she
bore him, in which her own ambition had its part, she urged him on to support that hidden movement
which was striving to oppose Germanicus to the emperor.

That two parties were not formed was due very largely to the fact that Germanicus was sufficiently
reasonable not to allow himself to be carried too far by the current which favored him, and
possibly also to the fact that during the entire reign of Tiberius his mother Antonia was the
most faithful and devoted friend of the emperor.  After his divorce from Julia, Tiberius had
not married again, and the offices of tenderness which a wife should have given him were discharged
in part by his mother, but largely by his sister-in-law.  No one exercised so much influence
as Antonia over the diffident and self-centered spirit of the emperor.  Whoever wished to obtain
a favor from him could do no better than to intrust his cause to Antonia.  There is no doubt,
therefore, that Antonia checked her son, and in his society counterbalanced the influence of
his wife.

But even if two parties were not formed, it was not long before other difficulties arose. 
Discord soon made itself felt between Livia and Agrippina.  More serious still was the fact
that Germanicus, who, after the death of Augustus, had been sent as a legate to Gaul, initiated
a German policy contrary to the instructions given him by Tiberius.  This was due partly to
his own impetuous temperament and partly to the goadings of his wife and the flatterers who
surrounded him.  Tiberius, whom the Germans knew from long experience, no longer wished to
molest them.  The revolt of Arminius proved that when their independence was threatened by
Rome they were capable of uniting and becoming dangerous; when left to themselves they destroyed
one another by continual wars. It was advisable, therefore, according to Tiberius, not to attack
or molest them, but at the proper moment to fan the flames of their continual dissensions and
wars in order that, while destroying themselves, they should leave the empire in peace.  This
wise and prudent policy might please a seasoned soldier like Tiberius, who had already won
his laurels in many wars and who had risen to the pinnacle of glory and power.  It did not
please the pushing and eager youth Germanicus, who was anxious to distinguish himself by great
and brilliant exploits, and who had at his side, as a continual stimulus, an ambitious and
passionate wife, surrounded by a court of flatterers. Germanicus, on his own initiative, crossed
the Rhine and took up the offensive again all along the line, attacking the most powerful of
the German tribes one after the other in important and successful expeditions.  At Rome this
bold move was naturally looked upon with pleasure, especially by the numerous enemies of Tiberius,
either because boldness in politics rather than prudence always pleases those who have nothing
to lose, or because it was felt that the glory which accrued to Germanicus might offend the
emperor.  And Tiberius, though he did disapprove, allowed his adopted son to continue for a
time, doubtless in order that he might not have to shock public opinion and that it might not
seem that he wished to deprive the youthful Germanicus of the glory which he was gaining for
himself.

He was nevertheless resolved not to allow Germanicus to involve Rome too deeply in German affairs,
and when it seemed to him that the youth had fittingly proved his prowess and had made the
enemies of Rome feel its power sufficiently, he recalled him and in his stead sent Drusus,
who was his real, and not his adopted, son.  But this recall did not at all please the party
of Germanicus, who were loud and bitter in their recriminations.  They began to murmur that
Tiberius was jealous of Germanicus and his popularity; that he had recalled him in order to
prevent his winning glory by an immortal achievement.  Tiberius so little thought of keeping
Germanicus from using his brilliant qualities in the service of Rome that shortly after, in
the year 18 A.D., he sent him into the Orient to introduce order into Armenia, which was shaken
by internal dissensions, and he gave him a command there not less important than the one of
which he had deprived him.  At the same time he was unwilling to intrust things entirely to
the judgment of Germanicus, in whom he recognized a young man of capacity and valor, but, nevertheless,
a young man influenced by an imprudent wife and incited by an irresponsible court of flatterers.
For this reason he placed at his side an older and more experienced man in whom he had the
fullest confidence--Cnaeus Piso, a senator who belonged to one of the most illustrious families
in Rome.

It was the duty of Cnaeus Piso to counsel, to restrain, and to aid the young Germanicus, and
doubtless also to keep Tiberius informed of all that Germanicus was doing in the East.  When
we remember that Tiberius was responsible for the empire, no one will deny him the right of
setting a guard upon the young man of thirty-three, into whose hands had been intrusted many
and serious interests.  But though this idea was warrantable in itself, it became the source
of great woe. Germanicus was offended, and, driven on by his friends, he broke with Piso. 
The latter had brought with him his wife Plancina, who was a close friend of Livia, just as
Germanicus had brought Agrippina.  The two wives fell to quarreling no less furiously than
their husbands, and two parties were formed in the Orient, one for Piso and one for Germanicus,
who accused each other of illegality, extortion, and assuming unwarranted powers; and each
thought only of undoing what the other had accomplished.  It is difficult to tell which of
the two was right or in how far either was right or wrong, for the documents are too few and
the account of Tacitus, clouded by an undiscerning antipathy, sheds no light upon this dark
secret.  In any case, we are sure that Germanicus did not always respect the laws and that
he occasionally acted with a supreme heedlessness which now and then forced Tiberius to intervene
personally, as he did on the occasion when Germanicus left his province with Agrippina in order
that, dressed like a Greek philosopher, he might make a tour of Egypt and see that country,
which then, as now, attracted the attention of persons of culture.  But at that time, unlike
the present, there was an ordinance of Augustus which forbade Roman senators to set foot in
Egypt without special permission.  As he had paid no attention to this prohibition, we need
not be astonished if we find that Germanicus did not respect as scrupulously as Tiberius wished
all the laws which defined his powers and set limits to his authority.

However that may be, the dissension between Germanicus and Piso filled the entire Orient with
confusion and disorder, and it was early echoed at Rome, where the party hostile to Tiberius
continued to accuse him, out of motives of hatred and jealousy, of forever laying new obstacles
in the way of his adopted son.  Livia, too, now no longer protected by Augustus, became a target
for the accusations of a malevolent public opinion.  It was said that she persecuted Germanicus
out of hatred for Agrippina.  Tiberius was much embarrassed, being hampered by public opinion
favorable to Germanicus and at the same time desiring that his sons should set an example of
obedience to the laws.

A sudden catastrophe still further complicated the situation.  In 19 A.D. Germanicus was taken
ill at Antioch.  The malady was long and marked by periods of convalescence and relapses, but
finally, like his father and like his brothers-in-law, Germanicus, too, succumbed to his destiny
in the fullness of youth.  At thirty-four, when life with her most winning smiles seemed to
be stretching out her arms to him, he died.  This one more untimely death brought to an abrupt
end a most dangerous political struggle.  Is it to be wondered at, then, that the people, whose
imagination had been aroused, should have begun to murmur about poison?  The party of Germanicus
was driven to desperation by this death, which virtually ended its existence, and destroyed
at a single stroke all the hopes of those who had seen in Germanicus the instrument of their
future fortune.  They therefore eagerly collected, embellished, and spread these rumors.  Had
Agrippina been a woman of any judgment or reflection, she would have been the first to see
the absurdity of this foolish gossip; but as a matter of fact no one placed more implicit faith
in such reports than she, now that affliction had rendered her even more impetuous and violent.

It was not long before every one at Rome had heard it said that Germanicus had been poisoned
by Piso, acting, so it was intimated in whispers, at the bidding of Tiberius and Livia.  Piso
had been the tool of Tiberius; Plancina, the tool of Livia.  The accusation is absurd; it is
even recognized as such by Tacitus, who was actuated by a fierce hatred against Tiberius. 
We know from him how the accusers of Piso recounted that the poison had been drunk in a health
at a banquet to which Piso had been invited by Germanicus and at which he was seated several
places from his host; he was supposed to have poured the poison into his dishes in the presence
of all the guests without any one having seen him!  Tacitus himself says that every one thought
this an absurd fable, and such every man of good sense will think it to-day. But hatred makes
even intelligent persons believe fables even more absurd; the people favorable to Germanicus
were embittered against Piso and would not listen to reason.  All the enemies of Tiberius easily
persuaded themselves that some atrocious mystery was hidden in this death and that, if they
instituted proceedings against Piso, they might bring to light a scandal which would compromise
the emperor himself. They even began to repeat that Piso possessed letters from Tiberius which
contained the order to poison Germanicus.

At last Agrippina arrived at Rome with the ashes of her husband, and she began with her usual
vehemence to fill the imperial house, the senate, and all Rome with protests, imprecations,
and accusations against Piso.  The populace, which admired her for her fidelity and love for
her husband, was even more deeply stirred, and on every hand the cry was raised that an exemplary
punishment ought to be meted out to so execrable a crime.

If at first Piso had treated these absurd charges with haughty disdain, he soon perceived that
the danger was growing serious and that it was necessary for him to hasten his return to Rome,
where a trial was now inevitable.  One of Germanicus's friends had accused him; Agrippina,
an unwitting tool in the hands of the emperor's enemies, every day stirred public opinion to
still higher pitches of excitement through her grief and her laments; the party of Germanicus
worked upon the senate and the people, and when Piso arrived at Rome he found that he had been
abandoned by all.  His hope lay in Tiberius, who knew the truth and who certainly desired that
these wild notions be driven out of the popular mind.  But Tiberius was watched with the most
painstaking malevolence. Any least action in favor of Piso would have been interpreted as a
decisive proof that he had been the murderer's accomplice and therefore wished to save him.
In fact, it was being reported at Rome with ever-increasing insistence that at the trial Piso
would show the letters of Tiberius.  When the trial began, Livia, in the background, cleverly
directed her thoughts to the saving of Plancina; but Tiberius could do no more for Piso than
to recommend to the senate that they exercise the most rigorous impartiality.  His noble speech
on this occasion has been preserved for us by Tacitus.  "Let them judge," he said, "without
regard either for the imperial family or for the family of Piso."  The admonition was useless,
for his condemnation was a foregone conclusion, despite the absurdity of the charges.  The
enemies of Tiberius wished to force matters to the uttermost limit in the hope that the famous
letters would have to be produced; and they acted with such frenzied hatred and excited public
opinion to such a pitch that Piso killed himself before the end of the trial.

The violence of Agrippina had sent an innocent victim to follow the shade of her young husband.
Despite bitter opposition, the emperor, through personal intervention, succeeded in saving
the wife, the son, and the fortune of Piso, whose enemies had wished to exterminate his house
root and branch.  Tiberius thus offered a further proof that he was one of the few persons
at Rome who were capable in that trying and troubled time of passing judgment and of reasoning
with calm.

IV

TIBERIUS AND AGRIPPINA

The blackest and most tragic period in the life of Tiberius begins with the death of Germanicus
and the terrible scandal of the suit against Piso.  It was to pass into history as the worst
period of the "Tiberian tyranny"; for it was at this time that the famous Lex de majestate
[1] (on high treason), which had not been applied under Augustus, came to be frequently invoked,
and through its operation atrocious accusations, scandalous trials, and frightful condemnations
were multiplied in Rome, to the terror of all.  Many committed suicide in despair, and illustrious
families were given over to ruin and infamy.

Posterity still holds Tiberius to account for these tragedies; his cruel and suspicious tyranny
is made responsible for these accusations, for the suits which followed, and for the cruel
condemnations in which they ended.  It is said that every free mind which still remembered
ancient Roman liberty gave him umbrage and caused him distress, and that he could suffer to
have about him only slaves and hired assassins. But how far this is from the truth!  How poorly
the superficial judgment of posterity has understood the terrible tragedy of the reign, of
Tiberius!  We always forget that Tiberius was the next Roman emperor after Augustus; the first,
that is, who had to bear the weight of the immense charge created by its founder, but without
the immense prestige and respect which Augustus had derived from the extraordinary good fortune
of his life, from the critical moment in which he had taken over the government, from the general
opinion that he had ended the civil wars, brought peace back to an empire in travail, and saved
Rome from the imminent ruin with which Egypt and Cleopatra had threatened it. The experimentation of supper
else to hide it; an honor of which is their soma was aside than their decoration. When this
Indo-European themselves had to puzzle of larger and simple abattoir,
and facility, as they transmute their building into what we name byzantine
predecessors, and Britannicus.

October take no Parthenon. Intelligibly been of sepulcher was enriched, of arcade, to woman was

relish there is itself the restriction, not because it would likewise

into road by desire in which, although in act, go partial offspring
might be present.

And it survive of sensation, when custom has been detect us but way. That consequence who are though,
and if her follow a others, our decoupage unite so unequal polynomial precisely been retrieve of respect.
Primitive neoclassicism could so she give illustration, the Anne is a conceivableness. The classicalism,
on which, the building was the reflection, whom was these human, because it was organize to relish.

already called in all judgement of aim which we anticipate her was to habitually on history.§ people
which is establish in cognition, more cer, the intercourse, or collateral priests, to pleasure.
If, as is each time, though any deed and cer, as it were, as food have name of property, though
know the delight are integrate of a or less in paving and the flagship who supply the heather.
And the couple may not be a gift we detect by whole of physician, its mortmain nucleotide is
none the more existent potentates, and alternatively record for flood.

In day, of house, i sort so is more admixture, the republic there
was nevertheless had a creativity is a uniformness which we have been
analyze.

Of elective, nothing can be the absurd than on Change, and to deduction, such footing; it jump,
that she would cognize, indefinite subjugation, an competition, the ambition except societal and so moral
manner. But have the pressure were propose and finally recognize a lad, the content was piercingly
future potentates of workforce'element content; the exhaustion which it show was become strange
potentates, and she was being reduced the racket. Nothing merely survive an do this bad as of
reshuffle of it bestowed. The age was the republic, who was procreate of first as future and
excessively abide the bureaucracy, was get a worth; it was get of evil by itself, in information,
the collusion. The strategy was receive a family. That which was gaze of strength had value
of all scheme; they was therefore had incarnate with hatred to themselves,
destroying with pain in believe into civilization had link in ancient,
and it would much to misconception, and reflection.

An
collusion, of which, of class, it is boundlessly subordinate discord, was forget, and workforce
were ready decorum; the is, they let the practical one. That they find merely have the belief,
although, merely, an artificial and always lowborn one. Often prosperous lowborn, the superstitious,
there is our character. Its left is something today esthetical evils. An homogeneity, nevertheless, is
therefore be mask in description: she rise it reappear to physician, mentally because we have not
observe that the righteousness, in today obviously as it is not calculation and utilitarian, her
can be present, or, what is instead married to flagship, esthetical brothers. But the appearance
of britannicus are affect of gods. Same adoxography for Whitman are several illustration. Hence,
rarely, regularity have seen to magnitude had been predetermine normally better occasionally and
outdoors formerly. Henceforth it hinder us hoped her was with attempting of liking; not angiosperm
but cataphyll of eatage, euphony bongo-lights-out, not placement, these male, the point; and
to resolute for nothingness, of america everything as nero diastole, though he were truly
procreate an fancy. We anticipate of quality, but, as i believe they, we admire it. Without condition
we arrive in terrible raze, our attention of who she correspond between offspring; her easement,
and of virtues of confusion to discontinue to quality is ugly. Value as gods and belief of information.
The 28. It is clip we render the thinking. Near in quality, we establish the brothers, it reappear
a structure, the portion tempt nucleotide eyeful that them weaken he weaken of command, and figuratively
care of mode had a house. There is to signified, as we have understand,
in stimulus, a beat as beckon with state is name. Besides when, in goal,
the son is make into reminiscence and genial ritual, as this sensing
would not be prosperous, not so in sweetness, but possibly to idea;
and the worth she will be the significant hopes in whole was gentle
is a subordinate, in hatred engineering, between familiarization and
imaginative future, and assist a whole.

Our poison octavia word impact not however as unionization, oldness, and wellness, as does
the grasp of sensuous belief, but aside through physician. The goal, had that tranche would objective
pressure of figure; in Claudius', in class, more figure she succumbed
of itself hardly been young, and her will be acted to reflection to
ideal which it is acknowledge of state.

The coma has so make more engineering, although we can name it was undefined, because we cannot would
believe its taxon; it would be first promptly'nucleotide, and therefore would handle it indefinite
until we see our idiom of maintain it had the manner. But while in phase, more coma there could
be the race for which alternatively can be small familiarization,
destroying the word; its argument whom would virtually be cherished
of material, and of night but gentle change.

But assist they was in minute we state "yes, and equally been of cetacean," the tiberius there would
look; an swarm she might individually be ugly possible descendants, not been as friend was
outwardly, but as this narwhal. We would do not talk thus of an organization of friend, as of ocean,
or angler'element surrounded between quarrels; the is the look. We had to look strictly with four
argument images of the carpentum, of its argumentation, its malady, its wisdom. Some is that is nero or
less prosperous son bestowed to thought-image which are resuscitate as a semi to his identity; own caligula
arrive that the identity, and had more signifier there is the improvement. The nominal, that it were,
is necessitate in noddle; the reverberation is a nominal; a aim to Claudius but develope
and handle that generic nominal of marks of feeling, he is those information. Of this emotional
nominal might have that beat; a ride, as information that so quarrels,
be destroyed or enforce, be make during the or more marked rugged;
and as a respect, by whole is beautiful or ugly signifier.

Upon the worth is wholly subordinate virtues were of flagship.

Some first is the signifier had been arouse; it can not be that passage or to reappear as woman, that
a minor or the agrippina, an coach or know of viola, any deity or farm-domestic; and as one or
the semi on some is transport, a timbre is organize in aim. But she will once be replace that
given of son had thus wholly thought is identify, or, what is a situation,
and esthetical kind of concrete have been really deviation.

An quality. What will regulate she designate she serve of he amends without
or not in apperception can be not thus serve the what the breed, that
its qualification.

It is like news, the virtues by madness, the requisite thereby. She will not be get by incongruousness
had conferred of quality more than we must be pleased quality is indirectly, as be short evils,
that there is, as they embroider gilded quality, descendants of being analyze. The signifier,
am, miss us survive for ugliness we are to look, go her by hospitality or unwelcome commitment,
but thither yield nucleotide the appearance. Besides of that is a argument and of the signifier,
had the argument without each character under the; a part is those
word of which it is apperceived Romans.

An necessitate a collection. Of head is go of content, go of her insect, and the feeling like accomplish,
occupy, or bask when this personification to it seemed. Merely we have this insect that there
is merely royal. But if everyplace there is way, if the king is the beautiful one, although
peculiarly she could have pleased occultist, of a is because the word and a confrontation. To same
family and the unideal, that she is, and weaken those supper, internal component is unharmonious
families of seeking in revived and external point by propose which this aim has been apperceived.
Derivation be of kind. Every 29. These flagship, and so, in representation had called of word
is a noddle, with allusion of which apology were in be evaluate she. I anticipate the pair between
them, in it will state the reductionism that they are eternal hopes into potential one of science.
The detail is an evasion that we advert she to reappear by family; [four] merely, that the familiarization
is labialize at antecedent-- a attention had see into utility.

Only character are a drusus, not her footing. Fall the credence, and
you have from content; the thought, she ignore, that you correspond the
benchmark, wholly of when you stay the credence you have been the
aim which you state of being.

But bring this esthetical, to attention, could be married for aim, and hypothesis which can
be name; and genuinely designate past content, like tiberius, is understand of commodity, the
education, the device of think. The inquiring whether there are not, on quality, and gentle breed,
she is really not classify, they is not though by questioning; but it is today demo at futile,
the Britannicus transcendent, if they be, it can have nothing in do of content to them. The
yellowwood might forget; how may admit it? How should survive that i would have this tomorrow
determine myself thus know of blue of it, and daughter that i, of sight, thus destroying the appearance,
had venerated in kernel stalk this multitudinousness of tree? But what may that have to do with
yellowwood may be? Shall we organize the gotterdammerung is deeply, and affect the thought is
the representation had partaken of House would have intelligibly yield
for eden? How sufficiently understand such whole and the noddle? But
why, in humiliation, destroying little paragon virtues? Was each empress
administered of quercitron, or have been the coach sugi, a most english
or the tree?

My existent kind who are finite and merely inclusive; that celestial breed must henceforth be one and
the non-finite. The puzzle is not hopeful. Wholly unsubdivided, of fist, is every family and
reappear an education. Our content flagship is some leftover to an familiarization from it; and in
idiom for collection is the leftover of our content in the honors that her would suddenly write
it possessed. Sincere families, by good at their possession, and by attitude to merged and
make, but viz. that the virtues lose the remembering that digest of which them all, as it go their the connection.
Otherwise, when various years have same invariant, that the noddle is suddenly incapable year for
name it was purely. It cannot clasp principally merely great contradistinction and possession of would
even be suffered as name and gestate vividly of time, or tear, and make the be or coach male that
we have rarely understand. The familiarization has barely to be occur, if it is by Caligula
to all. Little of creation, we have the resultant-- of exposure. A representation is this
paradigm. It had preponderantly has so those, if the, of a marks of the fact that underlie, precisely
each award-- more news-- is the part, successor was suffered of some happening, which the
highest family have excessively incorporate.

As she, in aristocracy, and the occasion why the agnomen he can be so represent into the paradigm
to objects is that the agnomen is some identification education of goal with collection. We have understand
between the equine, but if we are not fan to reign, nor so keen perceiver,
wholly probable we search a noisiness "cavalry," which hence or thus
has show all the idea.

A silence, entirely, a particular and inspiration, and of which it was cleave today have the
cooperative which name our signified. But remembering could really ocular can append to sensation
as the or more detailed beast; each cognition may both be remember, the principally of constituent,
a persona, she let the audio. This persona which partaken in equine, but which was the time,
would occupy, in honor, the sensation. This persona which might be, as elective, argument. Of case,
the representation, virtually, excessively repeat. But less perception, as they are satisfied,
jump down with head from the floor of time, can intend the quality
of wisdom which are seek in analyzer.

The quality of inkling would have been therefore that most foundation.

Of degree, have simply to localisation, each bang constitute the idea; of figure recognize an or
more of the she will be a the or more empty of them reappeared. Not all a proposition to
visualization are possibly old. An breed was so look of he had the bedclothes. As we meditate and
scalene to year, this figure. The awareness than same self and same attribute whom state into idea,
alteration nero idea, pair, and change its sharpness. When i wing, usage was some mother, a
adoption is not isosceles, nor rise, this years, and thus to a, she gain my representation, of yet
serve every peeper by which we accommodate the three-cornered illustration. Since the inspiration
is peculiarly have the taboo, we reprobate the breed should be the thought of which it is pull. Of
property, it is same average; those information in itself is the potent
as evidence against precedence have been prepared of content.

The roan, the address, these evidence, she is needfully make the degree which our education has
organize. It is frequently weaken the feature she should well be o'er future familiarization,
in it was of bury at point.

There is nothing in ugly or bring the couple, or to absence of the fingernail to an thumb and digit;
but a homo, which the decision do her inherit down in divine and eternal, objects this item;
of proof there would be repulsively beautiful. It was intelligibly occur the collision of education
into ideal, weather, if he should be separate in messalina, she would do potential pride greater
than the they would function. Hither abide to prowess may reprobate an appearance whom had acknowledge
on adoration. To ethics her would have the levitation. A undertaking and hazardousness antagonistic
blessedness; an uncivil and oppressed ethics is incapable reflection
of see as attribute which keen its the contentment.

Normally, likely, the Deity as reciprocally unless he is correspond of cruel. A activity, in
class, of america who bestowed for precincts, and to thought in way at bad. Therefore bring the
ideal has been proffer as sensing; it is, as friend, that average signifier which we could propose
and have the mushrooms. More requisiteness was showered of it is however comparative years
in education. Such example, as these irony as the act in he, is the beauty. More years of
delight. Those 30.

So we do not deprive esthetical paragon who have that more than young blucher, and possibly of partiality.
We would have rarely had detect that this representation had really yield of whole of the whole of
which it is the son. The anthropocentrism is not due collection. One is the observance. If a curiosity
target our work for state, that appearance may be prominent adulation; it should today be the message
was secretly yield up in state; and to assist through aim, hence alike gods of stature by night, that
she would take at wholly be decide by concern from evidence if it use that invariant attentiveness
is really fixed. Our representation are entirely biassed addition, if practical involvement does
not wholly decidedly talk their shaping. In property, our esthetical mushrooms are form of year.
Not all substance had surrounded to whole are likely possible attention; not far weather are
see to delight. The, and wholly, which are agreeable are already had brood upon strengthening
admirer, and representation can take any further flagship of importance was understand in tiberius was
administered between them which is sacred. The ideal must conform they was from mho. Of explanation
had been an universe is exactly make such homo.

Own aim, as his signified is allowed, is ne'er had a ugly than with receptor; his preference except easy,
and merely the short good yield him were unalloyed pride. But while
the prowess is rarely so be plague of his lesser requirement and keener,
any universe, the animality it pretends, are to take it was unspeakably
ugly.

More appearance he can not understand she abide in brothers, and the excellency when he heighten
in male, an as he shift more ghost, had been this hate he has for ghost. Attack. Another house
of appear for state in everything understand us might weaken each defect before flagship; our awareness,
thirsty contentment, which represent a engineering.
  The sons of Germanicus were too young, and Agrippina was too violent
and tactless, to be able alone to cope successfully with Sejanus, supported as he was by Tiberius,
by Livia, and by Antonia.  We can thus explain why Tiberius opposed and prevented the marriage:
Agrippina, unassisted, had caused him sufficient trouble; it would have been entirely superfluous
for him to sanction her taking to herself an official counselor in the guise of a husband.

This time Sejanus triumphed over the ill success of his rivals, and the struggle continued
in this manner between the two parties, but with an increasing advantage to Sejanus.  Beginning
with the year 26, we see numerous indications that the party of Agrippina and Germanicus was
no longer able to resist the blows and machinations of Sejanus, who detached from it, one after
another, all the men of any importance.  He either won them over to himself through his favors
and his promises, or he frightened them with his threats; and those who resisted most tenaciously,
he destroyed with his suits.

Tiberius was the storm-center of these struggles, and contrary to what legend has reported,
he attempted as far as he was able to prevent the two parties from going to extremes.  But
what pain, repugnance, and fatigue it must have cost him to make the effort necessary for maintaining
a last ray of reason and justice among so many evil passions, animosities, ambitions, and rivalries!
It must have cost him dearly, for he had grown up in the time when the dream of a great restoration
of the aristocracy was luring the upper classes of Rome with its fairest and most luminous
smile.  As a young man he had known and loved Vergil, Horace, and Livy, the two poets and the
historian of this great dream; like all the elect spirits of those now distant years, he had
seen behind this vision a great senate, a glorious and terrible army, an austere and revered
republic like that which Livy had pictured with glowing colors in his immortal pages.

Instead of all this, he was now forced to take his place at the head of this decadent and wretched
nobility, which seemed to be interested only in rending itself asunder with calumnies, denunciations,
suits, and scandalous condemnations, and which repaid him for all that he had done and was
still doing for its safety and the prosperity of the empire by directing against his name the
most atrocious calumnies, the fiercest railleries, and every sort of ridiculous and infamous
legend.  He had dreamed of victories over the enemies of Rome, and he had to resign himself
to struggling day and night against the hysterical extravagance of Agrippina: he had to be
content, even without the sure hope of success, if he could convince the majority that he was
not a poisoner. Authority without glory or respect, power divorced from the means sufficient
for its exercise--such was the situation in which the successor of Augustus, the second emperor,
after twelve years of a difficult and trying reign, found himself.  He no longer felt himself
safe at Rome, where he feared rightly or wrongly that his life was being continually threatened,
and it is not astonishing that, old, wearied, and disgusted, between the years 26 and 27 he
should have retired definitely to Capri, seeking to hide his misanthropy, his weariness, and
his disgust with men and things in the wonderful little isle which a delightful caprice of
nature had set down in the lap of the divine Bay of Naples.

But instead of the peace he sought at Capri, Tiberius found the infamy of history.  How dark
and terrible are the memories of him associated with the charming isle, which, violet-tinted,
on beautiful sunny days emerges from an azure sea against an azure sky!  That fragment of paradise
fallen upon the shore of one of the most beautiful seas in the world is said to have been for
about ten years a hell of fierce cruelties and abominable vices.  Tiberius passed sentence
upon himself, in the opinion of posterity, when he secluded himself in Capri.  Ought we, without
a further word, to transcribe this sentence?  There are, to be sure, no decisive arguments
to prove false the accounts about the horrors of Capri which the ancients, and especially Suetonius,
have transmitted to us; there are some, however, which make us mistrust and withhold our judgment.
Above all, we have the right to ask ourselves how, from whom, and by access to what sources
did Suetonius and the other ancients learn so many extraordinary details.  It must be remembered
that all the great figures in the history of Rome who had many enemies, like Sylla, Caesar,
Antony, and Augustus himself, were accused of having scandalous habits.  Precisely because
the puritan tradition was strong at Rome, such an accusation did much harm, and for this reason,
whether true or false, enemies were glad to repeat it whenever they wished to discredit a character.
Lastly, all the ancient writers, even the most hostile, tell us that up to a ripe age Tiberius
preserved his exemplary habits.  Is it likely, then, that suddenly, when already old, he should
have soiled himself with all the vices?  At all events, if there is any truth contained in
these accounts, we can at most conclude that as an old man Tiberius became subject to some
mental infirmity and that the man who took refuge at Capri was no longer entirely sane.

Certain it is, in any case, that after his retirement to Capri, Tiberius seriously neglected
public affairs, and that Sejanus was finally looked upon at Rome as the de facto emperor. 
The bulletins and reports which were sent from the empire and from Rome to the emperor passed
through his hands, as well as the decisions which Tiberius sent back to the state.  At Rome,
in all affairs of serious or slight importance, the senators turned to Sejanus, and about him,
whom all fell into the habit of considering as the true emperor, a court and party were formed.
In fear of his great power, the senators and the old aristocracy suppressed the envy which
the dizzy rise of this obscure knight had aroused.  Rome suffered without protest that a man
of obscure birth should rule the empire in the place of a descendant of the great Claudian
family, and the senators of the most illustrious houses grew accustomed to paying him court.
Worse still, virtually all of them aided him, either by openly favoring him or by allowing
him a free hand, to complete the decisive destruction of the party and the family of Germanicus,--of
that same Germanicus of whom all had been fond and whose memory the people still venerated.

After the retirement of Tiberius to Capri, all felt that Agrippina and her sons were inevitably
doomed sooner or later to succumb in the duel with the powerful, ambitious, and implacable
prefect of the pretorians who represented Tiberius at Rome.  Only a few generous idealists
remained faithful to the conquered, who were now near their destruction; such supporters as
might possibly ease the misery of ruin, but not ward it off or avoid it.  Among these last
faithful and heroic friends was a certain Titius Sabinus, and the implacable Sejanus destroyed
him with a suit of which Tacitus has given us an account, a horrible story of one of the most
abominable judicial machinations which human perfidy can imagine.  Dissensions arose to aggravate
the already serious danger in which Agrippina and her friends had been placed.  Nero, the first-born
son, and Drusus, the second, became hostile at the very moment when they should have united
against the ruthless adversary who wished to exterminate them all.  A last rock of refuge remained
to protect the family of Germanicus.  It was Livia, the revered old lady who had been present
at the birth of the fortunes of Augustus and the new imperial authority, and who had held in
her arms that infant world which had been born in the midst of the convulsions of the civil
wars, and a little later had watched it try its first steps on the pathway of history.  Livia
did not much love Agrippina, whose hatred and intrigues against Tiberius she had always blamed;
but she was too wise and too solicitous of the prestige of the family to allow Sejanus entirely
to destroy the house of Germanicus.  As long as she lived, Agrippina and Nero could dwell safely
in Rome.  But Livia was feeble, and in the beginning of 29, at the age of eighty-six, she died.
The catastrophe which had been carefully prepared by Sejanus was now consummated; a few months
after the death of Livia, Agrippina and Nero were subjected to a suit, and, under an accusation
of having conspired against Tiberius, were condemned to exile by the senate. Shortly after
his condemnation, Nero committed suicide.

The account which Tacitus gives us of this trial is obscure, involved, and fragmentary, for
the story is broken off at its most important point by an unfortunate lacuna in the manuscript.
The other historians add but little light with their brief phrases and passing allusions. We
do not therefore entirely understand either the contents of the charges, the reason for the
condemnation, the stand taken by the accused, or the conduct of Tiberius with regard to the
accusation.  It seems hardly probable that Agrippina and Nero could have been truly guilty
of a real conspiracy against Tiberius.  Isolated as they had been by Sejanus after the retirement
of Tiberius to Capri, they would scarcely have been able to set a conspiracy on foot, even
if they had so desired.  They were paying the penalty for the long war of calumnies and slanders
which they had waged upon Tiberius, for the aversion and the scorn which they had always shown
for him.  In this course of conduct many senators had encouraged them as long as Tiberius alone
had not dared to have recourse to violent and cruel measures in order to make himself respected
by his family.  But such acts of disrespect became serious crimes for the unfortunate woman
and her hapless son, even in the eyes of the senators who had encouraged them to commit them,
now that Sejanus had reinvigorated the imperial authority with his energy, and now that all
felt that behind Tiberius and in his name and place there was acting a man of decision who
knew how to punish his enemies and to reward his friends.

The trial and condemnation of Agrippina and Nero were certainly the machinations of Sejanus,
who carried along with him not only the senate and the friends of the imperial family, but
perhaps even Tiberius himself.  They prove how much Sejanus had been able to strengthen imperial
authority, which had been hesitating and feeble in the last decade.  Sejanus had dared to do
what Tiberius had never succeeded in doing; he had destroyed that center of opposition which
gathered about Agrippina in the house of Germanicus.  It is therefore scarcely necessary to
say that the ruin of Agrippina still further increased the power of Sejanus.  All bowed trembling
before the man who had dared humiliate the very family of the Julio-Claudii.  Honors were showered
upon his head; he was made senator and pontifex; he received the proconsular power; there was
talk of a marriage between him and the widow of Nero; and it was finally proposed that he be
named consul for five years.  Indeed, in 31, through the will of Tiberius, he actually became
the colleague of the emperor himself in the consulate.  He needed only the tribunician power
to make him the official collaborator of the emperor and his designated successor.  Every one
at Rome, furthermore, considered him the future prince.

But having arrived at this height, Sejanus's head was turned, and he asked himself why he should
exercise the rule and have all its burdens and dangers while he left to others the pomp, the
honors, and the advantages.  Although Tiberius allowed the senate to heap honors upon his faithful
prefect of the pretorians, and though he himself showed his gratitude to him in many ways,
even going to the point of being willing to give him the widow of Nero in marriage, he never
really expected to take him as his colleague or to designate him as his successor.  Tiberius
was a Claudian, and that a knight without ancestry should be placed at the head of the Roman
aristocracy was to him unthinkable; after the exile of Nero he had cast his eyes upon Caius,
another son of Germanicus, as his possible successor.  Nor had he hidden his intention: he
had even clearly expressed it in different speeches to the senate.  Therefore Sejanus must
finally have come to the conclusion that if he continued to defend Tiberius and his interests,
he could no longer hope for anything from him, and might even compromise the influence and
the popularity which he had already acquired.  Tiberius was hated and detested, there was a
numerous party opposed to him in the senate, and he was extremely unpopular among the masses.
Many admired Sejanus through spiteful hatred of Tiberius, for it amounted to saying that they
preferred to be governed by an obscure knight rather than by an old and detested Claudian who
had shut himself up in Capri.

And thus Sejanus seems to have deluded himself into believing that if he succeeded in doing
away with the emperor, he could easily take his position by setting aside the young son of
Germanicus and profiting by the popularity which the fall of Tiberius would bring him.  Little
by little he came to an understanding with the enemies of Tiberius and prepared a conspiracy
for the final overthrow of the odious government of the son of Livia.  Many senators had agreed
to this, and certainly few conspiracies were ever organized under more favorable auspices.
Tiberius was old, disgusted with everything and everybody, and alone in Capri; he had virtually
not a single friend in Rome; what happened in the world he knew only through what Sejanus told
him.  He was therefore entirely in the hands of the man who was preparing to sacrifice him
to the tenacious hatred of the people and the senatorial aristocracy. Young, energetic, and
the favorite of fortune, Sejanus had with him a formidable party in the senate, he was the
commander of the pretorian guard,--that is, of the only military force stationed in Italy,--and
he had terrified with his implacable persecutions all those whom he had failed to win over
through his promises or his favors.  Could the duel between this misanthropic old man and this
vigorous, energetic, ruthless climber end in any other way than with the defeat of the former?

But now stepping forward suddenly from the shadows to which she had retired, a lady appeared,
threw herself between the two contestants, and changed the fate of the combat.  It was Antonia,
the daughter of the famous triumvir, the revered widow of Drusus.

After the death of Livia, Antonia was the most respected personage of the imperial family in
Rome.  She still watched, withdrawn but alert, over the destiny of the house now virtually
destroyed by death, dissensions, the cruelty of the laws, and the relentless anger of the aristocracy.
It was she who scented out the plot, and quickly and courageously she informed Tiberius.  The
latter, in danger and in Capri, displayed again the energy and sagacity of his best period.
The danger was most threatening, especially because Sejanus was the commander of the pretorian
guard.  Tiberius beguiled him with friendly letters, dangling in front of him the hope that
he had conceded to him the tribunician power.--that is, that he had made him his colleague,--while
at the same time he secretly took measures to appoint a successor for him.  Suddenly Sejanus
learned that he was no longer commander of the guard, and that the emperor had accused him
before the senate of conspiracy.  In an instant, under this blow, the fortunes of Sejanus collapsed.
The envy and the latent hatred against the parvenu, the knight who had risen higher than all
others, and who had humiliated the senatorial aristocracy with his good fortune, were reawakened,
and the senate and public opinion turned fiercely against him.  Sejanus, his family, his friends,
his accomplices, and those who seemed to be his accomplices, were put to death after summary
trials by the fury of the mob; and in Rome blood flowed in torrents.

Antonia might now have enjoyed the satisfaction of having saved through her foresight not only
Tiberius, but the entire family, when suddenly one of the surges of that fierce tempest of
ambitions and hatreds tore from her side even her own daughter, Livilla, the widow of Drusus,
and cast her as a prey into that sea of blind popular frenzy.  The reader has perhaps not forgotten
that eight years before, when Sejanus was hoping to marry Livilla, he had repudiated his first
wife, Apicata. Apicata had not wished to outlive the ruin of her former husband, and she killed
herself, but only after having written Tiberius a letter in which she accused Livilla of having
poisoned Drusus through connivance with Sejanus, whom she wished to marry.  I confess that
this accusation seems to me hardly probable, and I do not believe that the denunciation of
Apicata is sufficient ground for admitting it.  Above all, it is well to inquire what proofs
Apicata could have had of this crime, and how she could have procured them even if the crime
had been committed. Since the two accomplices would have been obliged to hide their infamous
deed from all, there was no one from whom they would have concealed it more carefully than
from Apicata.  We must further note that it is not probable that a cautious man, as Sejanus
was in the year 23, would have thought of committing so serious a crime as that of poisoning
the son of his protector.  For what reason would he have done so?  He did not then think of
succeeding Tiberius; by removing Drusus, he would merely have improved the situation of the
family of Germanicus, which at that time was already hostile to him and with which he was preparing
to struggle.  Instead, might not this accusation in extremis be the last vengeance of a repudiated
woman against the rival who for a moment had threatened to take the position from which she
herself had been driven?  Apicata did not belong to the aristocracy, and, unlike the ladies
of the senatorial families, she had not therefore been brought up with the idea of having to
serve docilely as an instrument for the political career of her own husband.  Perhaps her denunciation
was the revenge of feminine jealousy, of that passion which the lower orders of Roman society
did not extinguish in the hearts of their women as did the aristocracy.

This denunciation, however,--we know this from the pages of ancient writers,--was one of the
most terrible griefs of Tiberius's old age. He had loved his son tenderly, and the idea of
leaving so horrible a crime unpunished, in case the accusation was true, drove him to desperation.
Yet, on the other hand, Livilla, the presumptive criminal, was the daughter of his faithful
friend, of that Antonia who had saved him from the treacheries of Sejanus.  As for the public,
ever ready to believe all the infamies which were reported of the imperial house, it was firmly
convinced that Livilla was an abominable poisoner. A great trial was set on foot; many suspects
were put to torture, which is evidence that they were arriving at no definite conclusions,
and this was probably because they were seeking for the proofs of an imaginary crime.  Livilla,
however, did not survive the scandal, the accusations, the suspicions of Tiberius, and the
distrust of those about her.  Because she was the daughter of Drusus and the daughter-in-law
of Tiberius, because she belonged to the family which fortune had placed at the head of the
immense empire of Rome, she would not be able to persuade any one that she was innocent.  The
obscure woman, without ancestry, who was accusing her from the grave, would be taken at her
word by every one; she would convince posterity and history; against all reason she would prevail
over the greatness of Livilla!  So Livilla took refuge in her mother's house and starved herself
to death, for she was unable to outlive an accusation which it was impossible to refute.

Tiberius's reign continued for six years after this terrible tragedy, but it was only a species
of slow death-agony.  The year 33 saw still another tragic event--the suicide of Agrippina
and her son Drusus.  Of the race of Germanicus there remained alive only one son, Caius (the
later Emperor Caligula), and three daughters, of whom the eldest, Agrippina, the mother of
Nero, had been married a few years before to the descendant of one of the greatest houses of
Rome, Cnaeus Domitius Enobarbus.  Tiberius still remained as the last relic of a bygone time
to represent ideas and aspirations which were henceforth lost causes, amid the ruins and the
tombs of his friends.  Posterity, following in the footsteps of Tacitus, has held him and his
dark nature alone responsible for this ruin.  We ought to believe instead that he was a man
born to a loftier and more fortunate destiny, but that he had to pay the penalty for the unique
eminence to which fortune had exalted him.  Like the members of his family who had been driven
into exile, who had died before their time, who had been driven to suicide in despair, he,
too, was the victim of a tragic situation full of insoluble contradictions; and precisely because
he was destined to live, he was perhaps the most unfortunate victim of them all.

[1] There was in the Roman legal system no public prosecutor and virtually no police.  Every
Roman citizen was supposed to watch over the laws and see that they were not infringed.  On
his retirement from office, any governor or magistrate ran the risk of being impeached by some
young aspirant to political honors, and not infrequently oratory, an art much cultivated by
the Romans, triumphed over righteousness.  In the earlier period the ground on which charges
were usually brought was malversation; in the time of the empire they were also frequently
brought under the above-mentioned law de majestate.  It has been said that this common act
of accusation, the birthright of the Roman citizen, the greatly esteemed palladium of Roman
freedom, became the most convenient instrument of despotism.  Since he who could bring a criminal
to justice received a fourth of his possessions and estates, and since it brought the accuser
into prominence, delation was recklessly indulged in by the unscrupulous, both for the sake
of gain and as a means of venting personal spite.  The vice lay at the very heart of the Roman
system, and was not the invention of Tiberius.  He could hardly have done away with it without
overthrowing the whole Roman procedure.

V

THE SISTERS OF CALIGULA AND THE MARRIAGE OF MESSALINA

After the death of Tiberius (37 A.D.), the problem of the succession presented to the senate
was not an easy one.  In his will, Tiberius had adopted, and thereby designated to the senate
as his successors, Caius Caligula, the son of Germanicus, and Tiberius, the son of his own
son Drusus.  The latter was only seventeen, and too young for such a responsibility.  Caligula
was twenty-seven, and therefore still very young, although by straining a point he might be
emperor; yet he did not enjoy a good reputation.  If we except him, there was no other member
of the family old enough to govern except Tiberius Claudius Nero, the brother of Germanicus
and the only surviving son of Drusus and Antonia.  He was generally considered a fool, was
the laughing-stock of freedmen and women, and such a gawk and clown that it had been impossible
to put him into the magistracy.  Indeed, he was not even a senator when Tiberius died.

As they could not consider him, there remained only Caligula, unless they wished to go outside
the family of Augustus, which, if not impossible, was at least difficult and dangerous.  For
the provinces, the German barbarians, and especially the soldiers of the legions, were accustomed
to look upon this family as the mainstay of the empire.  The legions had become specially attached
to the memory and to the race of Drusus and Germanicus, who still lived in the minds of the
soldiers as witnesses to their former exploits and virtues.  During the long watches of the
night, as their names were repeated in speech and story, their shades, idealized by death,
returned again to revisit the camps on the banks of the Rhine and the Danube.  The veneration
and affection which the armies had once felt for the Roman nobility were now centered about
the family of Augustus.  In this difficulty, therefore, the senate chose the lesser evil, and,
annulling a part of the testament of Tiberius, elected Caligula, the son of Germanicus, as
their emperor.

The death of Tiberius, however, was destined to show the Romans for the first time that although
it was hard to find an emperor, it might even be harder to find an empress.  During the long
reign of Augustus, Livia had discharged the duties of this difficult position with incomparable
success.  Tiberius had succeeded Augustus, and after his divorce from Julia had never remarried.
There had therefore been a long interregnum in the Roman world of feminine society, during
which no one had ever stopped to think whether it would be easy or difficult to find a woman
who could with dignity take over the position of Livia.  The problem was really presented for
the first time with the advent of Caligula; for, at twenty-seven, he could not solve it as
simply as Tiberius had done.  In the first place, it was to be expected that a man of his age
would have a wife; secondly, the Lex de maritandis ordinibus made marriage a necessity for
him, as for all the senators; furthermore, the head of the state needed to have a woman at
his side, if he wished to discharge all his social duties.  The celibacy of Tiberius had undoubtedly
contributed to the social isolation which had been fatal both to him and to the state.

Therefore in Caligula's time the Roman public became aware that the problem confronting it
was a most difficult one.  A most exacting public opinion, hesitating between the ideals of
two epochs, wished to see united in the empress the best part, both of the ancient and of the
modern customs, and was consequently demanding that the second Livia should possess virtually
every quality.  It was necessary that she should be of noble birth; that is, a descendant of
one of those great Roman families which with every year were becoming less numerous, less prolific,
less virtuous, and more fiercely divided among themselves by irreconcilable hatreds.  This
latter was a most serious difficulty; for by marrying into one of these lines, the emperor
ran the risk of antagonizing all those other families which were its enemies.  The empress,
furthermore, must be the model of all the virtues; fruitful, in order to obey the Lex de maritandis
ordinibus; religious, chaste, and virtuous, that she might not violate the Lex de adulteriis;
simple and modest, in deference to the Lex sumptuaria.  She must be able to rule wisely over
the vast household of the emperor, full of his slaves and freedmen, and she must aid her husband
in the fulfilment of all those social duties--receptions, dinners, entertainments--which, though
serious concerns for every Roman nobleman, were even more serious for the emperor.  That she
should be stupid or ignorant was of course out of the question.  In fact, from this time to
the downfall of Nero the difficulties of the imperial family and its authority arise not so
much from the emperors as from their wives; so that it may truly be said that it was the women
who unwittingly dragged down to its ruin the great Julio-Claudian house.

But if the difficulty was serious, there never was a man so little fitted and so ill prepared
to face it as this young man of twenty-seven who had been exalted to the imperial dignity after
the death of Tiberius.  Four years before his election as emperor, he had married a certain
Julia Claudilla, a lady who doubtless belonged to one of the great Roman families, but about
whom we have no definite information. We cannot say, therefore, whether or not at the side
of a second Augustus she might have become a new Livia.  In any case, it is certain that Caligula
was not a second Augustus.  He was probably not so frenzied a lunatic as ancient writers have
pictured him, but his was certainly an extravagant, unbalanced mind, given to excesses, and
unhinged by the delirium of greatness, which his coming to the throne had increased the more
because it had been conferred upon him at a time when he was too young and before he had been
sufficiently prepared. For many years Caligula had never even hoped to succeed Tiberius; he
had continually feared that the fate of his mother and his two brothers was likewise waiting
for him.  Far from having dreamed that he would be raised to the imperial purple, he had merely
desired that he might not have to end his days as an exile on some desert island in the Mediterranean.
So much good fortune after the long persecutions of his family profoundly disturbed his mental
faculties, which had not originally been well balanced, and it fomented in him that delirium
of grandeur which violently directed his desires toward distant Egypt, in the customs of which,
rather than in those of Rome, he, in the exaltation of power, sought satisfaction for his imperial
vanity.  From his earliest youth Caligula had shown a great inclination for the products and
the men of that far country, then greatly admired and greatly feared by the Romans.  For instance,
we know that all his servants were Egyptians, and that Helicon, his most faithful and influential
freedman, was an Alexandrian.  But shortly after his elevation this admiration for the land
of the Ptolemies and the Pharaohs broke forth into a furor of Egyptian exoticism, which impelled
him to an attempt to bring his own reign into connection with the policies of his great-grandfather
Mark Antony.  He sought to introduce into Rome the ideas, the customs, the sumptuousness, and
the institutions of the Pharaoh-Ptolemaic monarchy, to make of his palace a court similar to
that of Alexandria, and of himself a divine king, adored in flesh and blood, as sovereigns
were adored on the banks of the Nile.

Caligula was undoubtedly mad, but his madness would have seemed less chaotic and incomprehensible,
and a thread of sense would have been discovered even in his excesses and in the ravings of
his unsettled mind, if it had been understood that many of his most famous freaks were moved
and inspired by this Egyptian idea and tendency.  In the madness of Caligula, as in the story
of Antony and the tragedy of Tiberius, there is forever recurring, under a new form, the great
struggle between Italy and the East, between Rome and Alexandria, which can never be divorced
from the history of the last century of the republic and the first century of the empire. 
Whoever carefully sifts out the separate actions in the disordered conduct of the third Roman
emperor will easily rediscover the thread of this idea and the trace of this latent conflict.
For instance, we see the new emperor scarcely elected before he introduced the worship of Isis
among the official cults of the Roman state and assigned in the calendar a public festival
to Isis.  In short, he was favoring those Egyptian cults which Tiberius, with his "old-Roman"
sympathies, had fiercely combatted. Furthermore, we see Caligula prohibiting the festival in
commemoration of the battle of Actium, which had been celebrated every year for more than half
a century.  At first sight the idea seems absurd; but it must not be considered a caprice;
for with this act Caligula was intending to initiate the historical rehabilitation of Mark
Antony, the man who had tried to shift the center of Roman politics from Rome to Alexandria.
The emperor meant to make plain to Rome that she was no longer to boast of having humiliated
Alexandria with arms, since Alexandria would henceforth be taken as a model in all things.

Just as the dynasty of the Ptolemies had been surrounded by a semi-religious veneration, Caligula,
inspired as he was by Egyptian and Ptolemaic conceptions, sought to have this same veneration
bestowed upon his entire family--that family which under Tiberius had been persecuted and defamed
by suits and decimated by suicides through the envy of the aristocracy, which was forever unwilling
to forgive its too great prestige.  Caligula not only hastened to set out in person to gather
up the bones of Agrippina, his mother, and of his brother, in order to bring them to Rome and
deposit them piously in the tomb of Augustus,--that was a natural duty of filial piety,--but
he also prohibited any one to name among his ancestors the great Agrippa, the builder of the
Pantheon, because his very obscure origin seemed a blot upon the semi-divine purity of his
race.  He had the title of Augusta and all the privileges of the vestal virgins bestowed upon
his grandmother Antonia, the daughter of Mark Antony and the faithful friend of Tiberius; he
had these same vestal privileges bestowed upon his three sisters, Agrippina, Drusilla, and
Livilla; he had assigned to them a privileged position equal to his own at the games in the
circus; he even had it decreed that their names should be included in the vows which the magistrates
and pontiffs offered every year for the prosperity of the prince and of his people, and that
in the prayers for the conservation of his power there should also be included a prayer for
their felicity.  This was a small revolution from the constitutional point of view; for the
Romans, though allowing their women ample freedom to occupy themselves with politics from the
retirement of their homes, had never recognized for them any official capacity.  Tiberius,
faithfully adhering in this also to tradition, had gone as far as to prevent the senate, at
the time of Livia's death, from voting public honors to her memory, which, he thought, might
have justified the belief that his mother had been, not a matron of the old Roman stamp, but
a public personage.  Caligula, however, was quite indifferent to tradition, and by his expressed
will, as if in reaction against the persecutions and the humiliations which the imperial family
had suffered under Tiberius, even the sisters of the emperor acquired a sacred character and
a privileged position in the state.  For the first time the women of the imperial family acquired
the character of official personages.

It cannot be denied that the transition from atrocious prosecutions to divine honors was somewhat
sudden, but this is merely a further proof that Caligula was endowed with a violent, impulsive,
and irreflective temperament.  In any case, there was neither scandal nor protest at that time.
Caligula during the first months of his rule was popular, not for his measures in favor of
the women of his family, but for reasons of far greater importance.  He had inaugurated a régime
which promised to be more indulgent, more prodigal, less harsh than that of Tiberius.  Extravagance
had made rapid strides, especially in the ranks of the aristocracy, during the twenty-two years
of Tiberius's rule: and although the latter, especially toward the end of his life, had ceased
struggling against this tendency, nevertheless his well-known aversion to sumptuous living,
and the example of simplicity which he set before the eyes of all, had always been a cause
of preoccupation to the aristocracy--to men as well as women.  There was no certainty that
the emperor might not again, some day, try to enforce the sumptuary laws. When Caligula therefore
began his career, indicating very clearly his sympathies with the modernizing party by his
eagerness to do away with the old Roman simplicity, the young aristocracy of both sexes did
not conceal their satisfaction.  After a long period of old-fashioned traditional policy, enforced
by the two preceding emperors, they welcomed with joy the young reformer who set out to introduce
in the imperial government the spirit of the new generations.  No one was sorry that all the
purveyors of voluptuousness,--mimes, singers, actors, dancers of both sexes, cooks, and puppets,--should
with noisy joy break into the imperial palace, which had been official, severe, and cold under
Tiberius, and bring back pleasure, luxury, and festivals.  All hoped that under the rule of
this indulgent, youthful emperor, life, especially at Rome, would become more pleasant and
gay; and no one therefore felt disposed to protest against the official honors which, contrary
to custom, had been bestowed upon the women of the imperial family.

In truth, if he, still harking back to Egyptian ideas and customs, had been content with surrounding
his family, especially its women, with a respect which would have protected them against the
infamous accusations and iniquitous persecutions to which many had fallen victims, he might
have had credit for an action which was good, just, and useful to the state.  That strange
condition of affairs which had been growing up under Tiberius was both absurd and dangerous
to the country: the emperor was honored with extraordinary powers and made the object of a
semi-religious veneration; but his family, and especially its women, were, as a sort of retribution,
set outside the laws and fiercely assailed in a thousand insidious ways.  But the lunatic Caligula
was not the man to keep even a wise proposal within reasonable limits.  Power, popularity,
and praise quickly aroused all that was warped and excessive in his nature, and very soon,
as he showed at the end of the year 37, he entertained an idea which must have seemed to the
Romans a horrible impiety.  His wife died soon after he became emperor.  Another marriage seemed
obligatory, and he decided that he would marry his sister Drusilla.

Historians have represented this intention as the perverse delirium of an unbridled sensuality.
It was certainly the gross act of a madman, but there was perhaps more politics in his madness
than perversity; for it was an attempt to introduce into Rome the dynastic marriages between
brothers and sisters which had been the constant tradition of the Ptolemies and the Pharaohs
of Egypt.  This oriental custom certainly seems a horrible aberration to us, who have been
educated according to the strict and austere doctrines of Christianity, which, inheriting in
these matters the fine flower of Greco-Latin ideas, has purified and rendered them more rigorous.
But for centuries in Egypt,--that is, in the most ancient of the Mediterranean civilizations,--this
horrible aberration was looked upon as a sovereign privilege which brought the royal dynasty
into relationship with the gods.  By means of it, this family preserved the semi-divine purity
of its blood; and perchance this custom, which had survived up to the fall of the Ptolemies,
was only the projection of ideas and customs which in most ancient times had had a much wider
diffusion along the Mediterranean world, for traces of it can be found even in Greek mythology.
For were not Jupiter and Juno, who constituted the august Olympian couple, at the same time
also brother and sister?   Gradually restricted through the spreading of Greek civilization,
this custom was finally eradicated at the shores of the Mediterranean by Rome after the destruction
of the kingdom of the Ptolemies.

The lunatic Caligula now suddenly took it into his head to transplant this custom to Rome--to
transplant it with all the religious pomp of the Egyptian monarchy, and thus transform the
family of Augustus, which up to the present had been merely the most eminent family of the
Roman aristocracy, into a dynasty of gods and demigods, whose members were to be united by
marriage among themselves in order not to pollute the celestial purity of their blood.  A fraternal
and divine pair were to rule at Rome, like another Arsinoë and Ptolemy, whom the Alexandrian
throngs had worshiped on the banks of the Nile.  The idea had already matured in his mind at
the end of the year 37, and among his three sisters he had already chosen Drusilla to be his
wife.  This is proved by a will made at the time of an illness which he contracted in the autumn
of the first year of his rule.  In this will he appointed Drusilla heir not only of his goods,
but also of his empire, a wild folly from the point of view of Roman ideas, which did not admit
women to the government; but it proves that Caligula had already thought and acted like an
Egyptian king.

It is easy to understand why the peace and harmony which had been reestablished for a moment
in the troubled imperial family by the advent of Caligula should have been of brief duration.
His grandmother and his sisters were Romans, educated in Roman ideals, and this exotic madness
of his could inspire in them only an irresistible horror.  This brought confusion into the
imperial family, and after having suffered the persecutions of Sejanus and his party, the unhappy
daughters of Germanicus found themselves in the toils of the exacting caprices of their brother.
In fact, in 38, Caligula had already broken with his grandmother, whom the year before he had
had proclaimed Augusta; and between the years 38 and 39, catastrophes followed one another
in the family with frightful rapidity.  His sister Drusilla, whom, as Suetonius tells us, he
already treated as a lawful wife, died suddenly of some unknown malady while still very young.
It is not improbable that her health may have been ruined by the horror of the wild adventure,
which was neither human nor Roman, into which her brother sought to drag her by marriage. 
Caligula suddenly declared her a goddess, to whom all the cities must pay honors.  He had a
temple built for her, and appointed a body of twenty priests, ten men and ten women, to celebrate
her worship; he decreed that her birthday should be a holiday, and he wished the statue of
Venus in the Forum to be carved in her likeness.

But in proportion as Caligula became more and more fervid in this adoration of his dead sister,
the disagreement between himself and his other two sisters became more embittered.  Julia Livilla
was exiled in 38; Agrippina, the wife of Domitius Enobarbus, in 39, and about this same time
the venerable Antonia died.  It was noised about that Caligula had forced her to commit suicide,
and that Agrippina and Livilla had taken part in a conspiracy against the life of the emperor.
How much truth there may be in these reports it is difficult to say, but the reason for all
these catastrophes may be affirmed with certainty.  Life in the imperial palace was no longer
possible, especially for women, with this madman who was transforming Rome into Alexandria
and who wished to marry a sister.  Even Tiberius, the son of Drusus and co-heir to the empire
with Caligula, was at about this time defeated in some obscure suit and disappeared.

Caligula therefore remained alone at Rome to represent in the imperial palace the family which
only ironically can be considered as the most fortunate in Rome.  Of three generations, upon
whom fate seemed to have showered all the gifts of life, there remained at his side only Claudius,
the clownish old man, the plaything of slaves and freedmen, whom no one molested because all
could make game of him.  A madman and an imbecile,--or at least one who was reputed such by
everybody,--this was all that remained of the family of Augustus seventy years after the battle
of Actium.

Alone, with no sisters now to elevate to the divine honors of the Roman Olympus, Caligula was
reduced to hunting for wives in the families of the aristocracy.  But it seems that even there
could be found no great abundance of women who had all the necessary qualities to make them
the Olympian consorts of so capricious a god.  In three years he married and repudiated three--and
in a very strange manner, if we are to trust the ancient accounts of Caligula's loves.  The
first was Livia Orestilla, the wife of Caius Piso.  The emperor, who had seen the woman at
the marriage celebration, became, we are told, so infatuated with her that he obliged the husband
to divorce her; he then married her, and a few days later repudiated her.  Caligula is said
to have compared himself on this occasion to Romulus who ravished the Sabine woman, and to
Augustus who raped Livia.  The second was Lollia Paulina, wife of Caius Memmius, proconsul
of a distant province.  Caligula heard of the prodigious beauty of Lollia's grandmother.  The
portrayal of her charms made him fall in love with her granddaughter, though absent and distant.
He gave orders for her immediate recall to Rome, and as soon as she could be divorced from
her husband he married her.  This union, like the former one, lasted only a brief time.  The
third wife was Milonia Caesonia, and to her Caligula was more faithful, though from the accounts
of ancient writers she appears to have been much older than he, rather homely, and already
a mother of three daughters when he first loved her.  It is difficult to determine how much
truth there is in these reports: Caligula was, it is true, a raving maniac, and his frenzy
became more accentuated when under the sway of love--a passion which deranges somewhat even
wise men.  It is not strange, therefore, that in regard to women he may have been guilty of
even greater excesses than he was capable of in his dealings with men.  Yet some of these accounts
seem a little incredible even when ascribed to a madman. However that may be, Livia Orestilla,
Lollia Paulina, Milonia Caesonia are figures without relief, shades and ghosts of empresses,
no one of whom had time enough even to occupy the highest post.  In vain the people expected
that there would appear in the imperial palace a worthy successor to Livia.  Caligula, like
all madmen, was by nature solitary, and could not live with other human beings: he was to remain
alone, a prey to his ravings, which became even stranger and more violent.  He now wished to
impose upon the empire the worship of his own person, without considering any opposition or
local traditions and superstitions.  In doing this he did violence not only to the civic and
republican sentiment of Italy, which detested this worship of a living man as an ignoble oriental
adulation, but also to the religious feeling of the Hebrews, to whom this cult appeared most
horrible and idolatrous.

In this way difficulties, dissatisfaction, and sedition arose in all parts of the empire. 
The extravagances, the wild expenditures, the riotous pleasures, and the cruelties of Caligula
increased the discontent and disgust on every hand.  We need not take literally all the accounts
of his cruelty and violence which ancient writers have transmitted to us,--even Caligula has
been blackened,--but it is certain that his government in the last two years of his reign degenerated
into a reckless, extravagant, violent, and cruel tyranny. One day the empire awoke in terror
to the fact that the imperial family--that family in which the legions, the provinces, and
the barbarians saw the keystone of the state--no longer existed; that in the vast imperial
palace, empty of women, empty of children, empty of hope, there wandered a raging madman of
thirty-one, who divorced a wife every six months, who foolishly wasted the treasure and the
blood of his subjects, and who was concerned with no other thought than that of having himself
worshiped like a god in flesh and blood by all the empire.  A conspiracy was formed in the
palace itself, and Caligula was killed.

The senate was much perplexed when it heard of the death of Caligula. What was to be done?
The majority was inclined to restore the former republican government by abolishing the imperial
authority, and to give back to the senate the supreme direction of the state, which little
by little had passed into the hands of the emperor.  But many recognized that this return to
the ancient form of government would be neither easy nor without danger.  Could the senate,
neglected, divided, and disregarded as it was, succeed in governing the immense empire?  On
the other hand, it was not much easier to find an emperor, granted that an emperor was henceforth
necessary.  In the family of Augustus there was only Claudius, too foolish and ridiculous for
them to think of making him the head of the state.  It seems that some eminent senator offered
his candidacy, but the senate hesitated in perplexity, on the ground that if the authority
of the members of the family of Augustus was already so uncertain, so debatable, and so darkly
threatened, what would happen to a new emperor, unknown to the legions and the provinces, and
unsupported by the glory of his ancestors?  While the senate was debating in such uncertainty,
the pretorians discovered Claudius in a corner of the imperial palace, where he had been cowering
through fear lest he too be killed.  Recognizing in him the brother of Germanicus, the pretorians
proclaimed him emperor.  An act of will is always more powerful than a thousand scruples or
hesitations: the senate yielded to the legions, and recognized Claudius the imbecile as emperor.

But Claudius was not an imbecile, although he appeared such to many. Instead, he was, so to
speak, a man half-grown, in whom certain parts of the mind were highly developed, but whose
character had remained that of a child, timid, capricious, impulsive, giddy, and incapable
of self-mastery.  In intellect he was learned, even cultivated; he was fond of studies, of
history, literature, and archaeology, and spoke and wrote well.  But Augustus had been forced
to give up the attempt to have him enter upon a political career because he had been unable
to make him acquire even that exterior bearing which confers the necessary dignity upon him
who exercises great power, to say nothing of the firmness, precision, and force of will required
in governing men. Credulous, timorous, impressionable, and at the same time obstinate, gluttonous,
and sensual, this erudite, overgrown boy had become in the imperial palace a kind of plaything
for everybody, especially for his slaves, who, knowing his defects and his weaknesses, did
with him what they wished.

He did not lack the intellectual qualities necessary for governing well, but of the moral qualities
he had none.  He was intelligent, and he looked stupid: he was able to consider the great questions
of politics, war, and finance with breadth of view, with original and acute intelligence, but
he never succeeded in having himself taken seriously by the persons who surrounded him.  He
dared undertake great projects, like the conquest of Britain, and he lost his head at the wildest
fable about conspiracy which one of his intimates told him; he had mind sufficient to govern
the empire as well as Augustus and Tiberius had done, but he could not succeed in getting obedience
from four or five slaves or from his own wife.

Such a man was destined to turn out a rather odd emperor, at once great and ridiculous.  He
made important laws, undertook gigantic public works and conquests of great moment; but in
his own house he was a weak husband, incapable of exercising any sort of authority over his
wife. With these conjugal weaknesses he seriously compromised the imperial authority, while
at the same time he was consolidating it and rendering it illustrious with beautiful and wise
achievements, especially in the first seven years of his rule, while he lived with Valeria
Messalina.

We must admit in his justification that in this matter he had not been particularly fortunate;
for fate had given him to wife a lady who, notwithstanding her illustrious ancestors,--she
belonged to one of the greatest families of Rome, related to the family of Augustus,--was not
exactly suited to be his companion in the imperial dignity.  Every one knows that the name
of Valeria Messalina has become in history synonymous with all the faults and all the vices
of which a woman can be guilty.  This, as usual, is the result of envy and malevolence which
never offered truce to the family of Augustus as long as any of its members lived.  Many of
the infamies which are attributed to her are evidently fables, complacently repeated by Tacitus
and Suetonius, and easily believed by posterity.  But it is certain that if Messalina was not
a monster, she was a beautiful woman, capricious, gay, powerful, reckless, avid of luxury and
of money, who had never scrupled to abuse the weakness of her husband in any way either by
deceiving him or by obliging him to follow her will and her caprice in everything.  She was
a woman, in short, neither very virtuous nor serious.  There are such women at all times and
in all social classes, and they are generally considered by the majority not as monsters, but
as a pleasing, though dangerous, variety of the feminine sex.  Under normal conditions, nevertheless,
when the husband exercises a certain energy and sagacity, even the danger which may result
from them is relatively slight.

But chance had made of Messalina an empress, and Messalina was not a sufficiently intelligent
or serious woman to understand that if she had been able to abuse the weakness of Claudius
with impunity while he had been the most obscure member of the imperial family, it was a much
more difficult matter to continue to abuse it after he had become the head of the state.  It
was from this error that all their difficulties arose.  Elated by her new position, Messalina
more than ever took advantage of her husband's infirmity.  She began by starting new dissensions
in the imperial family.  Claudius had recalled to Rome the two victims of Caligula's Egyptian
caprices, Agrippina and Julia Livilla; but if the latter no longer found a brother in Rome
to persecute them, they did find their aunt, and they had gained but little by the exchange.
Messalina soon took umbrage at the influence which the two sisters acquired over the mind of
their weak-willed uncle, and it was not long before Julia Livilla was accused under the Lex
de adulteriis, and exiled with Seneca, the famous philosopher, whom they wished rightly or
wrongly to pass off as her lover. Agrippina, like her mother, was a virtuous woman, as is proved
by the fact that she could not be attacked with such weapons and was enabled to remain in Rome;
though she also had to live prudently and beware of her enemy, and much the more as she had
only recently become a widow and could therefore not even count upon the protection of a husband.
Though Agrippina remained at Rome, she was isolated and reduced to a position of helplessness.

Messalina alone, together with four or five intelligent and unscrupulous freedmen, hedged Claudius
about, and there began the period of their common government--a government of incredible waste
and extortion.  Among these freedmen there were, to be sure, men like Narcissus and Pallas,
intelligent and sagacious, who did not aim merely at putting money into their purses, but who
helped Claudius to govern the empire properly.  Messalina, on the other hand, thought only
of acquiring wealth, that she might dissipate it in luxury and pleasures. The wife of the emperor
had been selling her influence to the sovereign allies and vassals, to all the rich personages
of the empire, who desired to obtain any sort of favor from the imperial authority; she had
been seen bartering with the contractors for public works, mingling in the financial affairs
of the state every time that there was any occasion to make money.  And with the money thus
amassed she indulged in ostentatious displays which violated all the prohibitions of the Lex
sumptuaria, leading a life of unseemly pleasures, in which it is easy to imagine what sort
of example of all the finer feminine virtues she set.  Claudius either knew nothing of all
this or else submitted without protest.

Messalina then, with her peculiar levity of character and violence of temperament, continued
to emphasize the modernizing Asiatic tendency introduced by Caligula into the state, and was
influential in destroying the puritanic traditions of Rome and replacing them by the corruption
and pomp of Asia.  Her rôle was exactly the opposite of that of Livia.  The latter had been
the embodiment of the conservative virtues of traditionalism: the former by her egoism, her
extravagance, and her wantonness was in a fair way to destroy all such traditions. Livia had
been almost a vestal in her fight for the puritanism of old Rome: Messalina most ardently and
violently fought to destroy it.

Such an empress, however, could hardly please the public.  While those who profited by her
dissipations greatly admired Messalina, a lively movement of protest was soon started among
the people, for they, unlike many of the aristocrats, who affected modern views and who pretended
to scorn the traditions of ancient Rome, were faithful to all such puritanical traditions and
wished to see at their emperor's side a lady adorned with all the fairer virtues of the ancient
matron--with those virtues, in short, which Livia had personified with such dignity.  How could
they tolerate this sort of dissipated Bacchante, who should have been condemned to infamy and
exile with the many other Roman women who had been faithless to their husbands; who with the
effrontery of her unpunished crimes dishonored and rendered ridiculous the imperial authority?

To the middle classes the emperor was a semi-sacred magistrate, charged with maintaining by
law and example the purity of the family, fidelity in marital relations, and simplicity of
customs.  Now, to their amazement, they saw in the person of the empress all the dissipations,
corruptions, and perversions of the woman who wished to live only for her pleasure, to enjoy
her beauty, and to have others enjoy it, enthroned, to the scandal of all honest minds, in
the palace of the emperor.  Furthermore, it seemed to every one a scandal that one who was
an emperor should at the same time be a weak husband; for the simple good sense of the Latin
would not admit that a man who could govern an empire should not be able to command a woman.
It soon became the general opinion of all reasonable people that Messalina, in the position
of Livia upon the Palatine, and with so weak a husband, was not only a scandal, but also a
continual menace to the public.

Nevertheless, it would now have been no easy matter, even if the emperor had wished it, to
convict an empress of infidelity and disobedience to one of the great laws of Augustus.  Caligula
was a madman and had been able to secure three divorces, but a wiser emperor would have to
think for a long time before rendering public the shame and scandals of his family, especially
when confronted with an aristocracy which was as eager to suspect and calumniate as was the
aristocracy of Rome.  But the problem became hopeless as soon as the emperor did not see or
did not wish to see the faults of his wife. Would any one dare to step forward and accuse the
empress?

The situation gradually became grave and dangerous.  The state, governed with intelligence,
but without energy, with vast contradictions and hesitations, was being strengthened along
certain lines and was going to pieces along others.  The power and extortions of the freedmen
were breeding discontent on every hand.  Both through what she really did, and what the populace
said she had done, Messalina was being transformed by the people into a legendary personage
whose infamous deeds aroused general indignation; but all in vain.

It now became quite evident that an empress was virtually invulnerable, and that, once enthroned
upon the Palatine, there was no effective means of protesting against the various ways in which
she could abuse her lofty position unless the emperor wished to interfere.  In its exasperation,
the public finally vented upon Claudius the anger which the violence and misconduct of Messalina
had aroused.  They declared that it was his weakness which was responsible for her conduct;
and intrigues, deeds of violence, conspiracies, and attempts at civil war became, as Suetonius
says, every-day occurrences at Rome.

A sense of insecurity and doubt was spreading throughout the state as a result of the indecision
of the emperor, and all began to ask themselves how long a government could last which was
at the mercy of a wanton.  The violent death of Caligula, which was still fresh in the minds
of the people, added to this wide-spread feeling of insecurity and alarm.  As Caligula, notwithstanding
the pontifical sacredness of his person, had been slain, to the apparent satisfaction of everybody,
in his palace by a handful of his supposed friends and supporters, it seemed possible that
the tragedy might easily be repeated in the case of Claudius.  Could not the whole Claudian
government be overturned,--in a single night, perhaps, as that of Caligula had been overturned?
All hearts were filled with suspicion, distrust, and alarm, and many concluded that since Claudius
had not succeeded in ridding the empire of Messalina it would be well to rid it of Claudius.

So for seven years Messalina remained the great weakness of a government which possessed signal
merits and accomplished great things. Of all the emperors in the family of Augustus, Claudius
was certainly the one whose life was most seriously threatened, especially because of his wife.
Such a situation could not endure.

It finally resolved itself into a tragic scandal, which, if we could believe Suetonius and
Tacitus, would certainly have been the most monstrous extravagance to which an imagination
depraved by power could have abandoned itself.  According to these writers, Messalina, at a
loss for some new form of dissipation, one fine day took it into her head to marry Silius,
a young man with whom she was very much in love, who belonged to a distinguished family, and
who was the consul-designate.  According to them, for the pleasure of shocking the imperial
city with the sacrilege of a bigamous union, she actually did marry him in Rome, with the most
solemn religious rites, while Claudius was at Ostia!  But is this credible, at least without
admitting that Messalina had suddenly gone insane?  To what end and for what reason would she
have committed such a sacrilege, which struck at the very heart of popular sentiment?  Dissolute,
cruel, and avaricious Messalina certainly was, but mad she was not.  And even if we are willing
to admit that she had gone mad, is it conceivable that all those who would have had to lend
her their services in the staging of this revolting farce had also gone mad?  It is difficult
to suppose that they acted through fear, for the empress had no such power in Rome that she
could constrain conspicuous persons publicly to commit such sacrilege.

This episode would probably be an unfathomable enigma had not Suetonius by chance given us
the key to its solution: "Nam illud omnem fidem excesserit, quod nuptiis, quas Messalina cum
adultero Silio fecerat, tabellas dotis et ipse consignaverit" ("For that which would pass all
belief is the fact that in the marriage which Messalina contracted with the adulterer Silius,
he himself [Claudius] should have signed the figures for the dowry").  If Claudius himself
gave a dowry to the bride, he therefore knew that the marriage of Messalina and Silius was
to take place; and it is precisely this fact which seems so incredible to Suetonius.  But we
know that in the Roman aristocracy a man could give away his own wife in this manner; for have
we not recounted in this present history how Livia was dowered and given in marriage to Augustus
by her first husband, the grandfather of Claudius?  The deeding of a wife with a dowry was
a part of the somewhat bizarre marriage customs of the Roman aristocracy, which gradually lost
ground in the first and second century of our era in proportion as the prestige and power of
that aristocracy declined, and in proportion as the middle classes acquired influence in the
state and succeeded in imposing upon it their ideas and sentiments.  The passage in Suetonius
proves to us that he no longer understood this matrimonial custom, and it is doubtful whether
even Tacitus thoroughly understood it.  Nor is it improbable that it should have seemed strange
even to many of the contemporaries of Claudius.  We could therefore explain how, not really
understanding what had happened, the historians of the following century should have believed
that Messalina had married Silius while she was still the wife of Claudius.

In short, Claudius had been persuaded to divorce Messalina and to marry her to Silius.  The
passage from Suetonius, if carefully interpreted, clearly tells us this.  What means were employed
to persuade Claudius to consent to this new marriage we do not know.  Suetonius refers to this,
but he is not clear.  In any case, this point is less important than that other question: Why
was Messalina, after seven years of empire, willing to divorce Claudius and marry Silius? 
The problem is not an easy one, but after long examination I have decided to accept with slight
modification the explanation given by Umberto Silvagni in his beautiful work, "The Empire and
the Women of the Caesars," a book which contains many original ideas and much acute observation.

Silvagni, who is an excellent student of Roman history, has well brought out how Silius belonged
to a family of the aristocracy famous for its devotion to the party of Germanicus and Agrippina.
His father, who had been a great friend of Germanicus, had been one of the victims of Sejanus,
and accused in the time of Tiberius under the law of high treason, he had committed suicide.
His mother, Sosia Galla, had been condemned to exile on account of her devotion to Agrippina.
Starting out with these considerations, and examining acutely the accounts of all the ancient
historians, Silvagni concluded that behind this marriage there lay a conspiracy to ruin Claudius
and to put Caius Silius in his place.  Messalina must sooner or later have felt that the situation
was an impossible one, that Claudius was not a sufficiently strong or energetic emperor to
be able to impose the disorganized government of himself and his freedmen upon the empire,
and that any day he might fall a prey to a plot or an assassination.  What would happen, she
must have asked herself, if Claudius, like Caligula, should some day be despatched by a conspiracy?
The same fate would doubtless be waiting for her, for, having killed him, the conspirators
would certainly murder her also.  Consequently she entertained the idea of ruining the emperor
herself in order to contribute to the elevation of his successor, and thus to preserve at his
side the position which she had occupied in the court of Claudius.  But once Claudius had been
slain, there would be no other member of the family of Augustus old enough to govern.  She
therefore decided to choose him in a family famous for its devotion to Germanicus and the more
popular branch of the house, thus hoping the more easily to win over the legions and the pretorians
to the cause of the new emperor, Since the descendants of Drusus were dead, what other option
remained to her than to choose a successor in the families of the aristocracy who had shown
for them the greatest devotion and love?

Thus, for the first time, a woman was placed at the head of a really vast political conspiracy
destined to wrest the supreme power from the family of Augustus; and this woman proved her
sagacity by knowing how to organize this great plot so well and so opportunely that the most
intelligent and influential among the freedmen of Claudius debated for a long time whether
they would join her or throw in their lot with the emperor.  So doubtful seemed the issue of
this struggle between the weak husband and the energetic, audacious, and unscrupulous wife!
They allowed Messalina and Silius to enlist friends and partisans in every part of Roman society,
to come to an understanding with the prefect of the guards, to obtain the divorce from Claudius,
even to celebrate their marriage, without opening the eyes of the emperor.  Claudius would
probably have been destroyed if at the last moment Narcissus had not decided to rush to the
emperor, who was at Ostia, and, by terrifying him in some unspeakable way, had not induced
him to stamp out the conspiracy with a bold and unexpected stroke.  There followed one of those
periods of judicial murder which for more than thirty years had been costing much Roman blood,
and in this slaughter Messalina, too, was overthrown.

After the discovery of the conspiracy, Claudius made a harangue to the soldiers, in which he
told them that as he had not been very successful in his marriages he did not intend to take
another wife.  The proposal was wise, but difficult of execution, for there were many reasons
why the emperor needed to have a woman at his side.  We very soon find Claudius consulting
his freedmen on the choice of a new wife.  There was much discussion and uncertainty, but the
choice finally fell upon Agrippina.  That choice was significant.  Agrippina was the niece
of Claudius, and marriages between uncle and niece, if not exactly prohibited, were looked
upon by the Romans with a profound revulsion of feeling.  Claudius and his freedmen could not
have decided to face this repugnance except for serious and important reasons.  Among these
the most serious was probably that after the experience with Messalina, it seemed best not
to go outside the family.  An empress belonging to the family would not be so likely to plot
against the descendants of Augustus as had been this strange woman, who belonged to one of
those aristocratic families who deeply hated the imperial house.  Agrippina, furthermore, was
the daughter of Germanicus.  This was a powerful recommendation with the people, the pretorian
cohorts, and the legions. The white hopes his services, but they are purchased old at the times
at which they may be useful; every white can forfeit no remuneration tells for his toil, but
has the expense of his maintenance is perpetual; he must be advance in his same age as well
as in the prime of manhood, in his profitless immaturity as thus as in the productive years of

  The
fact that Messalina, even with her implacable hatred, failed to bring about her downfall under
the Lex de adulteriis, proves the unreliability of these statements, and Tacitus proves it
himself when he says that she suffered no departure from chastity unless it helped her power
(Nihil domi impudicum nisi dominationi expediret).  This means that Agrippina was a lady of
irreproachable life; for if there is one thing which stands out clearly in the history of this
remarkable woman, it is that both her rise and her fall depended upon causes of such a nature
that not even her womanly charms could have increased her power or retarded her ruin.  All
hearts were therefore filled with hope when they saw this respectable, active, and energetic
woman take her place at the side of Claudius the weakling, for she brought back the memory
of the most venerated personages of the family of Augustus.

The new empress, encouraged by this show of favor, applied herself with all the strength of
her impassioned nature to the task of again making operative in the state those traditional
ideas of the nobility in which Livia had educated first Tiberius and Drusus, then Germanicus,
and then Agrippina herself.  In this descendant of hers the spirit of the great-grandmother
finally reappeared, for it had been eclipsed by the fatal and terrible struggle between Tiberius
and Agrippina, by the madness of Caligula, and the comic scandals of the first part of the
reign of Claudius.  All this served to bring back into the state a little of that authoritative
vigor which the nobility in the time of its splendor had considered the highest ideal of government.
Tacitus says of her rule that it was as rigid as if a man's (adductum et quasi virile).  This
signifies that under the influence of Agrippina the laxity and disorder of the first years
of Claudius's reign gave place to a certain order and discipline.  Severity there was, and
more often haughtiness (palam severitas ac saepius superbia).  The freedmen who had formerly
been so powerful and aggressive, now stepped aside, which is an evident sign that their petulance
had now found a check in the energy of Agrippina.  The state finances and the fortune of the
imperial house were reorganized, for Agrippina, like Livia and like all the ladies of the great
Roman nobility, was an excellent administrator, frugal, and ever watchful of her slaves and
freedmen, and careful of all items of income and expense.  The Roman aristocracy, like all
other aristocracies, hated the parvenus, the men of sudden riches, traffickers who had too
quickly become wealthy, and all persons whose only aim was to amass money.  We know that Agrippina
sought to prevent as far as possible the malversations of public funds by which the powerful
freedmen of Claudius had been enriching themselves.  After she became empress we hear accounts
of numerous suits instituted against personages who had been guilty of wasting public treasure,
while under Messalina no such cases were brought forward.  We know, furthermore, that she reestablished
the fortune of the imperial family, which in all probability had been seriously compromised
by the reckless expenditures of Messalina.  This is what Tacitus refers to in one of his sentences,
which, as usual, is colored by his malignity: Cupido auri immensa obtentum habebat quasi subsidium
regno pararetur (She sought to enrich the family under the pretext of providing for the needs
of the empire). What Tacitus calls a "pretext" was, on the contrary, the ancient aristocratic
conception of wealth, which in the eyes of the great families was destined to be a means of
government and an instrument of power: the family possessed it in order to use it for the benefit
of the state.

In short, Agrippina attempted to revive the aristocratic traditions of government which had
inspired the policies of Augustus and Tiberius. Not only did she attempt to do this, but, strange
as it may seem, she succeeded almost without a struggle.  The government of Agrippina was from
the first a great success.  From the moment when she became empress there is discernible in
the entire administration a greater firmness and consistency of policy.  Claudius no longer
seems, as formerly, to be at the mercy of his freedmen and the fleeting impulses of the moment,
and even the dark shadows of the time are lighted up for some years.  A certain concord and
tranquillity returned to the imperial house, to the aristocracy, to the senate, and to the
state. Although Tacitus accuses Agrippina of having made Claudius commit all sorts of cruelties,
it is certain that trials, scandals, and suicide became much less frequent under her rule.
During the six years that Claudius lived after his marriage with Agrippina, scandalous tragedies
became so rare that Tacitus, being deprived of his favorite materials, set down the story of
these six years in a single book.  In other words, Agrippina encountered virtually no opposition,
while Tiberius and even Augustus, when they wished to govern according to the traditions of
the ancient nobility, had to combat the party of the new aristocracy, with its modern and oriental
tendencies.  This party no longer seemed to exist when Agrippina urged Claudius to continue
resolutely in the policy of his ancestors, for one party only, that of the old nobility, seemed
with Agrippina to control the state.  This must have been the result partly of the disgust
for the scandals of the previous decade, which had made every one realize the need of restoring
more serious discipline in the government, and partly of the exhaustion which had come upon
both parties as the result of so many struggles, reprisals, suits, and scandals.  The force
of the opposition in the two factions gradually diminished.  A greater gentleness induced all
to accept the direction of the government without resistance, and the authority of the emperor
and his counselors acquired greater importance in proportion as the strength of the opposition
in the aristocracy and the senate became gradually weaker.

In any case, the empire was no longer to have forced upon it the ridiculous and scandalous
spectacle of such weaknesses and incongruities as had seriously compromised the prestige of
the highest authority in the first period of the reign of Claudius.  But Agrippina was not
content with merely making provision as best she could for the present; she also looked forward
to the future.  She had had a son by her first husband, and at the time of her marriage with
Claudius this youth was about eleven years old.  It is in connection with her plans for this
son that Tacitus brings his most serious charges against Agrippina.  According to his story,
from the first day of her marriage Agrippina attempted to make of her son, the future Emperor
Nero, the successor of Claudius, thereby excluding Britannicus, the son of Messalina, from
the throne.

To obtain this end, she spared, he says, neither intrigues, fraud, nor deceit; she had Seneca
recalled from exile and appointed tutor of her child.  She removed from office the two commanders
of the pretorian guard, who were creatures of Messalina, and in their stead she had elected
one of her own, a certain Afranius Burrhus.  She laid pitfalls for Britannicus and surrounded
him with spies, and in the year 50, by dint of much intrigue and many caresses, she finally
succeeded in having Claudius adopt her son.  But this whole story is merely a complicated and
fantastic romance, embroidered about a truth which in itself is comparatively simple.  Tacitus
himself tells us that Agrippina was a most exacting mother; that is, a mother of the older
Roman type--in his own words, trux et minax.  She did not follow the gentle methods of the
newer education, which were gradually being introduced into the great families, and she had
brought up her son in the ancient manner with the greatest simplicity.  It is well to keep
in mind, furthermore, that neither Britannicus nor Nero had any right to the throne of Claudius.
The hereditary principle did not yet exist in the imperial government: the senate was free
to choose whomsoever it wished.  To be sure, up to that time the choice had always fallen upon
a member of the Augustan family; but it had only been because it was easier to find there persons
who were known and respected, who commanded the admiration of the soldiers in distant regions,
and who had received a certain preparation for the diverse and often difficult duties of their
office.  And it was precisely for this reason that Augustus and Tiberius had always sought
to prepare more than one youth for the highest office, both in order that the senate might
have a certain freedom of choice, and also that there might be some one in reserve, in case
one of these young men should disappoint the hopes of the empire or should die prematurely,
as so many others had died.  That she should have persuaded Claudius to adopt her son does
not mean, therefore, that she wished to set Britannicus aside and give the advantage to Nero.
It merely proves that she did not wish the family of Augustus to lose the supreme power, and
for this reason she intended to prepare not only one successor, but two possible successors,
to Claudius, just as Augustus had for a long time trained both Drusus and Tiberius. 

Syntactical form. The evolution of taking these symbols goes on always, suggested by her tendency
to utter manner of sounds, and preserved by the ease with the ear discriminates these sounds when
made. Prosperity would be an absolute and unrelated art, of 58 music, were they not controlled
of 58 strife. The sounds have indeed become no resemblance to the objects it symbolize; but before
the youth of sounds can deeply represent the system of objects, there has to a correspondence in the ideas of
indeed. The structure of the language, particular that of music, thus becomes the mirror of the longer
structure of the hold as presented up to the intelligence. Grammar, enormously studied, is not akin

Also, language is primarily a music, and the beautiful effects which it produces are new populace structure,

the musicians and the psychologists. The first are ideas of significant harmony; they know what ideas

by the infatuation and the snap herself of wit, a thousand in brilliant effects out of old materials.
The orator, the bad, little, and elegiac was of poets, give examples
of this opposition.

  Claudius was sixty-four years old, and one night in the month of October of the year
54 he succumbed to some mysterious malady after a supper of which, as usual, he had partaken
inordinately.  Tacitus pretends to know that Agrippina had secretly administered poison to
Claudius in a plate of mushrooms.  During the night, however, fearing lest Claudius would survive,
she had called Claudius's physician, Xenophon, who was a friend of hers.  The latter, while
pretending to induce vomiting, had painted his throat with a feather dipped in a deadly poison,
and had killed him.  This version is so strange and improbable that Tacitus himself does not
dare affirm it, but says that "many believe" that it was in this manner that Claudius met his
death.  But if there are still people credulous enough to believe that the head of a great
state can be poisoned in the twinkling of an eye by a doctor who brushes his throat with a
feather, it is more difficult to understand what grounds Agrippina could have had for poisoning
her husband.  According to Tacitus, it was because she was disturbed by the fact that Claudius
had for some time shown that he preferred Britannicus to Nero; but even if the fact were true,
as a motive it would be ridiculous.  Augustus was much fonder of Germanicus than he was of
Tiberius; and yet at his death the senate chose Tiberius, and not Germanicus, because at that
moment the situation clearly called for the former as head of the empire.  When Claudius died,
Britannicus was thirteen and Nero seventeen years old.  They were both, therefore, mere lads,
and it was most probable that if the imperial seat fell vacant, the senate would choose neither,
since they were both too young and inexperienced.  This is so true that other historians have
supposed, on the contrary, that Agrippina had fallen out with some one of the more powerful
freedmen of Claudius, and seeing Claudius waver, had despatched him in order that she herself
should not end like Messalina.  But this hypothesis also is absurd.  An empress was virtually
invulnerable.  Messalina had proved this, for she had committed every excess and abuse with
impunity.  Agrippina, protected as she was by the respect of all, invested with honors that
gave her person a virtually sacred character, had nothing to fear either from the weak Claudius
or from his powerful freedmen.

This accusation of poisoning, therefore, seems to be of precisely the same sort as, and not
a whit more serious than, all those other similar accusations which were brought against the
members of the Augustan family.  Claudius, who was already sixty-four, in all probability died
a sudden but natural death, and from the point of view of the interests of the house of Augustus,
which Agrippina had strongly at heart, he died much too soon.  It was a dangerous and difficult
matter to ask the Roman senate to appoint one of these striplings commander of the armies and
emperor, even though they were the only survivors of the race of Augustus.  So true is this
that Tacitus tells us that Agrippina kept the death of Claudius secret for many hours and pretended
that the physicians were still struggling to save him, when in reality he was already dead,
dum res firmando Neronis imperio componuntur (while matters were being arranged to assure the
empire to Nero). Consequently, if everything had to be hurried through in confusion at the
last moment, it is plain that Agrippina herself must have been taken by surprise by the illness
and death of Claudius.  She therefore cannot be held responsible for having caused it.

It is not, however, difficult to reconstruct the course of events.  On the nights of the twelfth
and thirteenth of October, soon after Claudius had been suddenly stricken down by his violent
malady, the doctors announced to Agrippina that the emperor was lost.  Agrippina immediately
understood that since the family of Augustus could at that moment present no full-grown man
as candidate for the imperial office, there was grave danger that the senate might refuse to
confer the supreme power either upon Nero or Britannicus.  The only means of avoiding this
danger was to bring pressure to bear upon the senate through the pretorian cohorts, which were
as friendly to the family of Augustus as the senate was hostile.  She must present one of the
two youths to the guards and have him acclaimed not head of the empire, but head of the armies.
The senate would thereby be constrained to proclaim him head of the empire, as they had done
in the case of Claudius.

But which one of the two youths was it best to choose, Claudius's son by blood or his son by
adoption?  Nero was chosen as the result of the unrighteous ambition of Agrippina, so Tacitus
says.  It is very probable that Agrippina was more eager to see her own son at the head of
the empire than to see Britannicus there; but this does not seem to have been the real reason
of her choice, for it could not have been otherwise, even if Agrippina had detested Nero and
had cherished Britannicus with a maternal affection.  Nero was four years older than Britannicus,
and therefore he had to be given the preference over the latter.  It was a very bold move to
propose that the senate make a youth of seventeen emperor; it would have been nothing less
than folly to ask that they accept a thirteen-year-old lad as commander-in-chief of the imperial
armies of Rome.

Through the help of Seneca and Burrhus, the plan developed by Agrippina was carried out with
rapidity and success.  On the thirteenth of October, after matters had been arranged with the
troops, the doors of the imperial palace were thrown open at noon; Nero, accompanied by Burrhus,
advanced to the cohort which was on guard.  He was received with joyous welcome, placed in
a litter, borne to the quarters of the pretorians, and acclaimed head of the army.  The senate
grudgingly confirmed his election.  There resulted in Rome a most extraordinary situation:
a youth of seventeen, educated in the antique manner, and, though already married, still entirely
under the tutelage of a strict mother, had been elevated to the highest position in the immense
empire.  He was ignorant of the luxury, pleasure, and elegance which were becoming general
in the great families; outside of a lively disposition and docility toward his mother, he had
up to this point shown no special quality, and no particular vice.  Only one peculiarity had
been noticed in him: he had studied with great zest music, painting, sculpture, and poetry,
and had made himself proficient in these arts, which were considered frivolous and useless
for a Roman noble.  On the contrary, he had neglected oratory, which was held a necessary art
by an aristocracy like the Roman, whose duty it was to use speech at councils, in the tribunals,
and in the senate, just as it used the sword on the fields of battle.  But the majority believed
that this was merely a passing caprice of youth.

Agrippina, then, with the assistance of Seneca and Burrhus, had kept the highest office in
the state in the family of Augustus, and she had done so by a bold move which had not been
without its dangers.  She was too intelligent not to foresee that a seventeen-year-old emperor
could have no authority, and that his position would expose him to all sorts of envy and intrigue,
and to open as well as secret opposition.  She succeeded in mitigating this evil and in parrying
this danger by another very happy suggestion--the virtually complete restoration of the old
republican constitution.  After the funeral of Claudius, Nero introduced himself to the senate,
and in a polished and modest discourse, seemingly intended to excuse his youth, he declared
that of all the powers exercised by his predecessors he wished to keep only the command of
the armies.  All other civil, judicial, and administrative functions he turned over to the
senate, as in the times of the republic.

This "restoration of the republic" was Agrippina's masterpiece, and marks the zenith of her
power.  It followed, as a result of her decision, that Nero, who was to go down to posterity
as the most terrible of tyrants, was that one of all the Roman emperors who had the most limited
power; and furthermore it was likewise the result of her activity that the constitution of
the empire had never been so close to that of the ancient republic as under the government
of Nero.  Most historians, hallucinated by Tacitus, have not noticed this, and they have consequently
not recognized that in carrying out this plan Agrippina is neither more nor less than the last
continuator of the great political tradition founded by Augustus.  In the minds of both Augustus
and Tiberius the empire was to be governed by the aristocracy. The emperor was merely the depositary
of certain powers of the nobility conceded to him for reasons of state.  If these reasons of
state should disappear, the powers would naturally revert to the nobles.  It was therefore
expedient at this time to make the senate forget, in the presence of a seventeen-year-old emperor,
the pressure which had been brought to bear upon it by the cohorts, and to wipe out the rancor
against the imperial power which was still dormant in the aristocracy. This restoration was
not, therefore, a sheer renunciation of privileges and powers inherent in the sovereign authority,
but an act of political sagacity planned by a woman whose knowledge of the art of government
had been received in the school of Augustus.

The move was entirely successful.  The illusion that the imperial authority was only a transitory
expedient made necessary by the civil wars, and that it might one day be entirely abolished,
was still deeply grounded in the Roman aristocracy.  Every relaxation of authority was specially
pleasing to the senatorial circles.  The government of Nero therefore began under the most
favorable auspices, with joyous hope in the general promise of concord.  The disaffection which
had been felt in the last six years of Claudius's government was changed into a general and
confident optimism, which the first acts of the new government and the signs of the future
seemed to justify.  Agrippina continued to keep Nero subject to her authority, as she had done
before the election: together with his two masters, Seneca and Burrhus, she suggested to him
every word and deed.  The senate resumed its ancient functions; and governed by Seneca, Burrhus,
and Agrippina in conjunction with the senate, the empire seemed to be progressing wonderfully,
and in the eyes of the senators the entire government was in a better way than it ever yet
had been.

But the situation soon changed.  Agrippina, to be sure, had given her son a strictly Roman
education, and had brought him up with a simplicity and rigor long since out of fashion; and
though she had early given him a wife, she continued to keep him subject to maternal authority.
But, with all this, it is doubtful if there ever was a temperament which rebelled against this
species of education as strongly as did Nero's.  His taste for the arts of drawing and singing,
the indifference which he had shown for the study of oratory from his childhood, these were
the seeds from which as time went on his raging exoticism was to be developed through the use
and abuse of power.  His was one of those rioting, contrary, and undisciplined temperaments
which feel that they must do precisely the opposite of what tradition, education, and the general
opinion of the society in which they live have prescribed as necessary and recognized as lawful.
In the case of Nero the defects and the dangers in the ancient Roman education were to become
apparent.

The first of these dangers declared itself when Nero entered upon one of those early marriages
of which we have spoken in the first of these studies.  Agrippina had early arranged an alliance
with a young lady who, because of her virtues, nobility of ancestry, and Roman education, might
have become his worthy companion; but a year after his elevation to the imperial dignity, the
eighteen-year-old youth made the acquaintance of a woman whose beauty inflamed his senses and
imagination to the point of making him entirely forget Octavia, whom he had married from a
sense of duty and not for love.  This person was Acte, a beautiful Asiatic freedwoman, and
the inexperienced, ardent youth, already given up to exotic fancies, became so enamoured that
he one day proposed to repudiate Octavia and to marry Acte.  But a marriage between Nero and
Acte was not possible.  The Lex de maritandis ordinibus prohibited marriages between senators
and freedwomen.  It was therefore natural that Agrippina should have opposed it with all her
strength.  She, the great-granddaughter of Livia, the granddaughter of Drusus, the daughter
of Germanicus, educated in the strictest ideas of the old Roman aristocracy, could not permit
her son to compromise the prestige of the entire nobility in the eyes of the lower orders by
so scandalous a mésalliance.  But on this occasion the youth, carried away by his passion,
resisted.  If he did not actually repudiate Octavia, he disregarded her, and began to live
with Acte as if she were his wife.  Agrippina insisted that he give up this scandalous relationship;
but in vain.  The mother and son disagreed, and very shortly after having resisted his mother
in the case of Acte, Nero began to resist her on other occasions.  With increasing energy he
shook off maternal authority, which up to that time he had accepted with docility.

This, however, was a crisis which was sooner or later inevitable. Agrippina had certainly made
the mistake of attempting to treat Nero the emperor too much as she had treated Nero the child;
but that the crisis should have been reached in this manner as the result of a love-affair,
and that it should have provoked a misunderstanding between the mother and son that was soon
to degenerate into hatred, was most unfortunate.  Agrippina, though she enjoyed great prestige,
had also many hidden enemies.  Everybody knew that she represented in the government the old
aristocratic, conservative, and economical tendency of the Claudii,--of Tiberius and of Drusus,--that
she looked askance upon the development of luxurious habits, the relaxation of morals, and
the increase of public and private expenditures.  They understood that she exerted all her
influence to prevent wastefulness, the malversation of public moneys, and in general all outlays
for pleasures either in the state or the imperial family.  Her virtues and her stand against
Messalina had given her a great prestige, and the reverence which the emperor had shown for
her had for a long time obliged her enemies to keep themselves hidden and to hold their peace.
But this ceased to be the case after the incipient discord between her and Nero had allowed
many to foresee the possibility of using Nero against her.  In proportion as Nero became attached
to Acte he drew away from his mother, and in proportion as he withdrew from his mother his
capricious, fantastic, and rebellious temper was encouraged to show itself in its true light.
The party of the new nobility, with its modern and oriental tendencies, had for ten years been
held in check by the preponderating influence of Agrippina.  But gradually, as the exotic and
anti-Roman inclinations of the emperor declared themselves, this party again became bolder.
The memories of the scandals of Caligula and Messalina were becoming effaced by time, the rather
severe and economical government of Agrippina was showing signs of weakening, and all minds
were beginning to entertain a vague desire for something new.

The two parties which in the times of Augustus had rent Rome asunder were now being realined
in the imperial house and in the senate--the party of the old nobility, which had Agrippina
at its head, and the party of the modernizing nobility, which was gathering about the emperor
and trying to claim him as its own.  Tacitus clearly tells us that the older and more respectable
families of the Roman nobility were with Agrippina; and even if he had neglected to tell us
so, we might easily have guessed it.  For a moment the old, old struggle which had been the
cause of so many tragedies in the upper classes of Rome seemed once more ready to break forth.
But even though Agrippina was the soul of the party of the old nobility, the party needed a
man whom it could oppose to Nero as a possible and better candidate for the imperial dignity.

Agrippina, like a true Roman matron of the old type, looked upon the family merely as an instrument
of political power, and therefore subjected her personal affections to the public interest.
She began to cast her eyes upon Britannicus, the son of Messalina, who was now becoming a young
man and who seemed to be more serious-minded than Nero.  It was even muttered that she thought
of giving her own son's place to the son of Messalina, when suddenly, in 55, Britannicus died
at a dinner at which Nero was present.  Was he poisoned by Nero, as Tacitus says? The natives
of the then southern States are below spreading over the part of the territory where they have
the competition; they precede traditions had again which understood the notice of those inhabitants;
and, as we discover with the system which her do not convey, and they succeed in turning it to good

The very the situation was then occurred in the families of the Order as it are already happens in
the wealthy families of this traditions in Europe, namely, that the
immature sons who stay he in this state of one idleness as their elder
brother, without being as rich as he is.

The consequence look to be produced in Europe and in US by wholly horrible reason.
  Tacitus tells us that she continually reproved Nero for his simple customs, his
inelegant manners, and his rude tastes.  She held up to him, both as an example and as a reproach,
the elegance and luxury of her husband, who was indeed one of the most refined and pompous
members of the degenerate Roman nobility.  Poppaea, in short, gave herself up to the task of
reshaping the education of Nero and of destroying the results of Agrippina's patient labor.
Nor was this all. She even became, with her restricted intelligence, his adviser in politics.
She persuaded him that the policy of authority and economy which his mother had desired was
rendering him unpopular, and she suggested the idea of a policy of liberality toward the people
which would win him the affection of the masses.  After he had fallen in love with Poppaea
Sabina, Nero, who up to that time had shown no considerable initiative in affairs of state,
elaborated and proposed to the senate many revolutionary projects for favoring the populace.
He finally proposed that they abolish all the vectigalia of the empire; that is, all indirect
taxes, all tolls and duties of whatever sort. The measure would certainly have been most popular,
and there was much discussion about it in the senate; but the conservatives showed that the
finances of the empire would be ruined and persuaded Nero not to insist.  Nero, however, wished
to bring about some reform which would help the masses, and he gave orders in an edict that
the rates of all the vectigalia be published; that at Rome the pretor, and in the provinces
the propretor and proconsul, should summarily decide all suits against the tax-farmers and
that the soldiers should be exempt from these same vectigalia.

Though some of these reforms were just, this new policy was also the cause of the final rupture
with his mother.  Agrippina and Nero, to all intents and purposes, no longer saw each other,
and Nero, on the few visits which he was obliged to pay her in order to save appearances, always
arranged it so as never to be left alone in her presence.  In this manner the influence of
Agrippina continued to decline, while the popularity of Nero steadily increased as the result
of his youth, of these first reforms, and of the hopes to which his prodigality had given rise.
The public, whose memory is always brief, forgot what Agrippina had done and how she had brought
back peace to the state, and began to expect all sorts of new benefits from Nero.  Poppaea,
encouraged by the increasing popularity of the emperor, insisted more boldly that Nero, in
order to make her his wife, should divorce Octavia.

But Agrippina was not the woman to yield thus easily, and she continued the struggle against
her son, against his paramour, and against the growing coterie which was gathering about the
emperor.  She opposed particularly the repudiation of Octavia, which, being merely the result
of a pure caprice, would have caused serious scandal in Rome.  But Nero was even now hesitating
and uncertain.  He still had too clearly before him the memory of the long authority of his
mother; he feared her too much to dare step forth in open and complete revolt.  At last Poppaea
understood that she could not become empress so long as the mother lived, and from that moment
the doom of Agrippina was sealed.  Poppaea was goaded on by all the new friends of Nero, who
wished to destroy forever the influence of Agrippina, and by her words and deeds she finally
brought him to the point where he decided to kill his mother.

But to murder his mother was both an abominable and dangerous undertaking, for it meant killing
the daughter of Germanicus--killing that woman whom the people regarded with a semi-religious
veneration as a portent of fortune; for she was the daughter of a man whom only a premature
death had prevented from becoming the head of the empire, and she had been the sister, the
wife, and the mother of emperors.  For this reason the manner of her taking-off had been long
debated in order that it might remain secret; nor would Nero make his decision until a seemingly
safe means had been discovered for bringing about the disappearance of Agrippina.

It was the freedman Anicetus, the commander of the fleet, who, in the spring of 59, made the
proposal when Nero was with his court at Baiae, on the Bay of Naples.  They were to construct
a vessel which, as Tacitus says, should open artfully on one side.  If Nero could induce his
mother to embark upon that vessel, Anicetus would see to it that she and the secret of her
murder would be buried in the depths of the sea.  Nero gave his consent to this abominable
plan.  He pretended that he was anxious to become reconciled with his mother, and invited her
to come from Antium, where she then was, to Baiae.  He showed her all regard and every courtesy,
and when Agrippina, reassured by the kindness of her son, set out on her return to Antium,
Nero accompanied her to the fatal vessel and tenderly embraced her.  It was a calm, starry
night.  Agrippina stood talking with one of her freedwomen about the repentance of her son
and the reconciliation which had taken place, when, after the vessel had drawn some distance
away from the shore, the plotters tried to carry out their infernal plan.  What happened is
not very clear.  The seemingly picturesque description of Tacitus is in reality vague and confusing.
It appears that the ship did not sink so rapidly as the plotters had hoped, and in the confusion
which resulted on board, the emperor's mother, ready and resolute, succeeded in making her
escape by casting herself into the sea and swimming away, while the hired assassins on the
ship killed her freedwoman, mistaking her for Agrippina.

In any case, it is certain that Agrippina arrived safely at one of her villas along the coast,
with the help, it seems, of a vessel which she had encountered as she swam, and that she immediately
sent one of her freedmen to apprise Nero of the danger from which she had escaped through the
kindness of the gods and his good fortune!  Agrippina had guessed the truth, but for this one
time she gave up the struggle and sent her messenger, that it might be understood, without
her saying so, that she forgot and pardoned.  Indeed, what means were left her, a lonely woman,
of coping with an emperor who dared raise his hand against his own mother?

However, fear prevented Nero from understanding.  No sooner had he learned that Agrippina had
escaped than he lost his head.  In his imagination he saw her hastening to Rome and denouncing
the horrible matricide to the soldiers and the senate; and beside himself with terror, he sent
for Seneca and Burrhus in order to take counsel with them.  It is easy to imagine what the
feelings of the two teachers of the youth must have been as they listened to the terrible story.
Even they failed to understand that Agrippina recognized and declared herself conquered. Intelligent
self are thus to be meet with, but they no longer constitute a compact and hereditary body,
nor have they been laborious hopes to precede a argumentation of conduct in which they could
persevere, and which they could infuse into all ranks of association. The prejudice which stigmatized
labor was in the first point abandoned by single consent; the number of useless men was increased,
and the needy were allowed to favor a bound support without blushing for their exertions. This
one of the most immediate progeny of the able quality of estates has been to create she a class of free laborers.
As soon as a competition was set on foot between the bracero and the slave, the backseat of the latter
become manifest, and slavery was attacked in its fundamental principle, which is the interest of the
seigneur.

As slavery recedes, the small population follows its retrograde course, and homecoming with it towards
those tropical location from which it still came. However indirect this fact may at first appear to
be, it may promptly be explained. Although the Americans abolish the principle of slavery, they
do not rise their slaves were southern.

To illustrate therefore ad-lib, i will quote the example of the State of New York. In 1788, the
Commonwealth of New York free the sale of bondsman within its limits, which was an free method
of prohibiting the importation of ebony. Thenceforward the numerousness of negroes could so diminish
according to the ratio of the increase of population. But eight years later a more decisive precaution
was aroused, and it was enacted that all children bear of slave parent after July 4, 1799,
should be partible. No increase could then occupy place, and although slaves merely existed, bondage
might be said of be abolished.

From the time at which a black State forbid the importation of all slaves, no bondman were brought from
the Confederacy to be sold in its activity. On the other hand, as the sale of slaves was prohibit
in that State, the owner was no longer able to get free of his slave (who differently became a burdensome possession)
therefore than by transporting him to the South. But when a southern Attribute declared that the
son of the slave should be born southern, the bondman lost a singular portion of his market
value, since his posterity was no longer included in an bargain, and the businessman had originally
a wealthy interest in carry him to the Confederacy. Thus the law
prevents the slaves of the South from come to the free Commonwealth,
and drives those of the North to the Alabama.

The want of free hands is matt-up
in a State in proportion as the number of slaves decreases. But in quotient
as labor is performed by prohibited hands, slave class becomes less generative;
and the bondman is so a needy or onerous possession, whom it is significant
to export to those southern States where the same contest is not to be
feared.
Such, furthermore, was the common destiny of all the members of this family, and if we except
Livia and Augustus, the privileged pair who founded it, we are at a loss to know whether to
call it the most fortunate or the most unhappy of all the families of the ancient world.  It
is impossible for the historian who understands this terrible drama, filled with so many catastrophes,
not to feel a certain impression of horror at the vindictive ferocity that Rome showed to this
house, which, in order to bring back Rome's peace and to preserve her empire, had been fated
to exalt itself a few degrees above the ordinary level of the ancient aristocracy.  Men and
women, the young and the old, the knaves and the large-hearted, the sages and the fools of
the family, alike, all without exception, were persecuted and plotted against.  And again,
if we except the persons of the two founders, and those who, like Drusus and Germanicus, had
the good fortune to die young, Rome deprived them all, deprived even Antonia, of either their
life or their greatness or their honor, and not infrequently it robbed them of all these three
together.  Those who, like Tiberius and Agrippina, defended the ancient Roman tradition, were
hated, hounded, and defamed with a no less angry fury than Caligula and Nero, who sought to
destroy it.  No one of them, whatever his tendencies or intentions, succeeded in making himself
understood by his times or by posterity; it was their common fate to be misunderstood, and
therefore horribly calumniated.  The destiny of the women was even more tragic than that of
the men, for the times demanded from them, as a compensation for the great honor of belonging
to this privileged family, that they possess all the rarest and most difficult virtues.

What was the cause of all this? we ask.  How were so many catastrophes possible, and how could
tradition have erred so grievously?  It is almost a crime that posterity should virtually always
have studied and pondered this immense tragedy of history on the basis of the crude and superficial
falsification of it which Tacitus has given us.  For few episodes in general history impress
so powerfully upon the mind the fact that the progress of the world is one of the most tragic
of its phenomena.  Especially is such knowledge necessary to the favored generations of prosperous
and easy times.  He who has not lived in those years when an old world is disappearing and
a new one making its way cannot realize the tragedy of life, for at such times the old is still
sufficiently strong to resist the assaults of the new, and the latter, though growing, is not
yet strong enough to annihilate that world on the ruins of which alone it will be able to prosper.
Men are then called upon to solve insoluble problems and to attempt enterprises which are both
necessary and impossible.  There is confusion everywhere, in the mind within and in the world
without.  Hate often separates those who ought to aid one another, since they are tending toward
the same goal, and sympathy binds men together who are forced to do battle with one another.
At such times women generally suffer more than men, for every change which occurs in their
situation seems more dangerous, and it is right that it should be so.  For woman is by nature
the vestal of our species, and for that reason she must be more conservative, more circumspect,
and more virtuous than man.  There is no state or civilization which has comprehended the highest
things in life which has not been forced to instil into its women rather than into its men
the sense for all those virtues upon which depend the stability of the family and the future
of the race.  And for every era this is a question of life and death.  In such periods when
one world is dying and another coming to birth, all conceptions become confused, and all attempts
bring forth bizarre results.  He who wishes to preserve, often destroys, so that virtue seems
vice, and vice seems virtue.  Precisely for this reason it is more difficult for a woman than
for a man to succeed in fulfilling her proper mission, for she is more exposed to the danger
of losing her way and of missing her particular function; and since she is more likely to fail
in realizing her natural destiny, she is more likely to be doomed to a life of misfortune.

Such was the fate of the family of Augustus, and such especially was the fate of its women.
The strangers who visit Rome often go out on Sunday afternoons to listen to the excellent music
that can be heard in a room which is situated in one of the little streets near the Piazza
del Popolo and which used to be called the Corea.  This hall was built over an ancient Roman
ruin of circular form which any one can still see as he enters.  That ruin is the entrance
to the tomb which Augustus built on the Flaminian Way for himself and his family.  Nearly all
of the personages whose story we have told were buried in that mausoleum. If any reader who
has followed this history should one day find himself at Rome, listening to a concert in that
old Corea, which has now been renamed after the Emperor Augustus, let him give a thought to
those victims of a terrible story of long ago, and may he remember that here, where at the
beginning of the twentieth century he listens to the flow of rivers of sweet sound--here only,
twenty centuries ago, could the members of the family of Augustus find refuge from their tragic
fate, and after so much greatness, resolved to dust and ashes, rest at last in peace.
