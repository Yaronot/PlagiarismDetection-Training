When, months after the seizure of the CHAPMAN, Valois learns of this pitiful attempt, he curses
the stupid conspirators. If anyone refused to obey such demands
appeared cleared fields, crops lost, and could even raise half timeless night just to escape the
thatched roof was coming down in flames and choking on its smoke foul.

Gafarró, which was the best boy in the garden planted Ruzafa, swore discovered, and spent ambushed
at night in cañares, roaming the paths, with the shotgun on his arm, but One morning he was
found in a ditch with the belly pierced and broken head ... and guess who gave you.

Even the Valencia papers spoke of what happened in the garden, where at dusk closing the barracks
and there was a panic selfish, seeking each his salvation, forgetting neighbor. And all this,
Uncle Batiste, the mayor of that district of the garden, casting rays by mouth every time the authorities,
who respected him as a potential electoral hablábanle the matter and ensuring that he and his trusty
bailiff, the Sigrid, were sufficient to eliminate that calamity.

Despite this, we felt did not intend to go to the mayor. Why? I did not want to hear in vain bravado
and lies.

The truth was, they asked forty dollars, and if not let them in the oven will burn your hut,
hut that he looked like a child and near miss, with its walls dazzling white, the black cap
of straw with little crosses at the ends, windows blue, the vine over the door as green lattice, which
filtered the sun with palpitations Live Gold, the clumps of geraniums and dompedro orlando housing,
restrained by a fence cane, and beyond the old fig tree furnace, mud-brick, round and flat
like a swarm of Africa. That was all her fortune, the nest that was home to the most beloved: his
wife, three kids, the couple of old nags, faithful companions in the daily battle for bread, and
pink and white cow that was every morning through the streets of the city up people with their
sad jangle and letting out their real six udders always swollen.

Much had to scratch the four lumps from his great-grandfather came watering all family with sweat
and blood, to join the handful of drives that kept buried in a pot under the bed! Then it was left
boot forty dollars! ... He was a man of peace; entire garden could meet him. Squabbles or irrigation,
or visits to the tavern, or shotgun nice to miss her. Work hard for the three brats Pepeta and was
his only hobby; but because they wanted to rob, know defense. Christ!
 He prays that he may lead it, when it heads
the Confederate advance into Ohio. Until now they had not seen ... Gentlemen, take me where you want, but if it can declare
that I will come to whistle to the thief Italian ... I've been sick, I'm alone: ââit explodes,
man, as if you had no daughter. Your Conchita is not yours, is Franchetti ... but it is art.
And now I say: If art is that the girls parents forget that they were killed, I say I futro in art
and I'm most happy to meet my shell to enter the house mending my
socks.

Sea lions out of business after forty years of sailing with all kinds
of risks and adventures, the captain was his neighbor Llovet important
CabaÃ±al a population: white houses of one story, with wide streets,
straight and hot sun, like a small American city.

The people of Valencia who summered there gazing curiously at the old sea dog, sitting in an armchair
listed under the canvas awning shaded the door of his house. Forty years spent in the open, on
the deck of his ship, enduring the rain and spray from the waves,
moisture had infiltrated to the very bones, and rheumatism slave,
remained the most of the day motionless in his chair, burst into groans
and curses every time he stood up.

Tall, muscular, with a swollen stomach and fell on his legs, his face tanned by the sun and carefully
shaved, the captain seemed a priest on vacation, quiet and good-natured at the door of his
house. Her gray eyes staring and imperative, eyes of a man accustomed to command, were all that
justified the captain's reputation Llovet, the dark legend that floated around his name. He had spent
his life in continual struggle with the British Royal Navy, escaping the persecution of his famous
cruise in the brig full of dark meat, carrying off the coast of Guinea to the West Indies. Bold
and unalterable coldness never saw him swing his sailors. ContÃ¡banse horrible things about
him. Whole black cargo thrown overboard to escape the cruiser gave chase;
Atlantic sharks going to flock, by boiling the waves with his funeral
waggle, covering the sea of ââblood stains, dividing his teeth
slaves, waving to despair his arms out of the water contained crew
revolts by him alone and hacked to death, abductions of blind rage
in which he ran for cover like a beast, even talked about some woman
who accompanied him on his travels, which, since the bridge, was thrown
overboard by the angry captain after a dispute over jealousy.

And with this, unexpected outbursts of generosity hands full relief to the families of the sailors.
In a fit of anger was able to kill one of their own, but if someone
fell into the water, cast to save without fear of sea and their voracious
beasts.

Mad with rage if black buyers deceived him in a few pesetas, and
spent the night three or four thousand dollars celebrating one of
those orgies that had made him famous in Havana.

 A black pall
hangs over a land given up to the butchery of brothers. Mountain chains, misted in the blue
smoke of battle, rise unpityingly over heaps of unburied dead from the Potomac to the Mississippi. The blow broke his nose. And a trickle of blood from his broken nose stained
the white pulp. He peered like a madman. He rolled his arms and screamed for him to let go.
In this thought, the tone is not fixed in it. Angry dogs were chasing each other,
never quenched the thirst of passion. Ah, big loss! She and her mother blazed her courage with
their drinks.

Everyone could see Pepet becoming thinner, more yellow, less as a melted
candle.
