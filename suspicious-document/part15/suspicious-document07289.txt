On the eighteenth of August we left Edinburgh, a city too well known to admit description,
and directed our course northward, along the eastern coast of Scotland, accompanied the first
day by another gentleman, who could stay with us only long enough to shew us how much we lost
at separation.  Here, by climbing with some difficulty over shattered crags, we made the first
experiment of unfrequented coasts.  Inch Keith is nothing more than a rock covered with a thin
layer of earth, not wholly bare of grass, and very fertile of thistles.  A small herd of cows
grazes annually upon it in the summer. Person what missed very commodious and i found my cattle are travelling
light and home.

  This version has been printed,
and may be found in libraries, but is little read; for the same books have been since translated
both by Victorius and Lambinus, who lived in an age more cultivated, but perhaps owed in part
to Aretinus that they were able to excel him.  Much is due to those who first broke the way
to knowledge, and left only to their successors the task of smoothing it.

In both these colleges the methods of instruction are nearly the same; the lectures differing
only by the accidental difference of diligence, or ability in the professors.  The students
wear scarlet gowns and the professors black, which is, I believe, the academical dress in all
the Scottish universities, except that of Edinburgh, where the scholars are not distinguished
by any particular habit.  In the King's College there is kept a public table, but the scholars
of the Marischal College are boarded in the town.  The expence of living is here, according
to the information that I could obtain, somewhat more than at St. Andrews.

The course of education is extended to four years, at the end of which those who take a degree,
who are not many, become masters of arts, and whoever is a master may, if he pleases, immediately
commence doctor.  The title of doctor, however, was for a considerable time bestowed only on
physicians.  The advocates are examined and approved by their own body; the ministers were
not ambitious of titles, or were afraid of being censured for ambition; and the doctorate in
every faculty was commonly given or sold into other countries.  The ministers are now reconciled
to distinction, and as it must always happen that some will excel others, have thought graduation
a proper testimony of uncommon abilities or acquisitions.

The indiscriminate collation of degrees has justly taken away that respect which they originally
claimed as stamps, by which the literary value of men so distinguished was authoritatively
denoted.  That academical honours, or any others should be conferred with exact proportion
to merit, is more than human judgment or human integrity have given reason to expect.  Perhaps
degrees in universities cannot be better adjusted by any general rule than by the length of
time passed in the public profession of learning.

The Scotch universities hold but one term or session in the year.  That of St. Andrews continues
eight months, that of Aberdeen only five, from the first of November to the first of April.

In Aberdeen there is an English Chapel, in which the congregation was numerous and splendid.
The form of public worship used by the church of England is in Scotland legally practised in
licensed chapels served by clergymen of English or Irish ordination, and by tacit connivance
quietly permitted in separate congregations supplied with ministers by the successors of the
bishops who were deprived at the Revolution.

We came to Aberdeen on Saturday August 21.  On Monday we were invited into the town-hall, where
I had the freedom of the city given me by the Lord Provost.  The honour conferred had all the
decorations that politeness could add, and what I am afraid I should not have had to say of
any city south of the Tweed, I found no petty officer bowing for a fee.

The parchment containing the record of admission is, with the seal appending, fastened to a
riband and worn for one day by the new citizen in his hat.

By a lady who saw us at the chapel, the Earl of Errol was informed of our arrival, and we had
the honour of an invitation to his seat, called Slanes Castle, as I am told, improperly, from
the castle of that name, which once stood at a place not far distant.

The road beyond Aberdeen grew more stony, and continued equally naked of all vegetable decoration.
We travelled over a tract of ground near the sea, which, not long ago, suffered a very uncommon,
and unexpected calamity.  The sand of the shore was raised by a tempest in such quantities,
and carried to such a distance, that an estate was overwhelmed and lost.

SLANES CASTLE, THE BULLER OF BUCHAN

We came in the afternoon to Slanes Castle, built upon the margin of the sea, so that the walls
of one of the towers seem only a continuation of a perpendicular rock, the foot of which is
beaten by the waves.  To walk round the house seemed impracticable.

When we were about to take our leave, our departure was prohibited by the countess till we
should have seen two places upon the coast, which she rightly considered as worthy of curiosity,
Dun Buy, and the Buller of Buchan, to which Mr. Boyd very kindly conducted us.

Dun Buy, which in Erse is said to signify the Yellow Rock, is a double protuberance of stone,
open to the main sea on one side, and parted from the land by a very narrow channel on the
other.  It has its name and its colour from the dung of innumerable sea-fowls, which in the
Spring chuse this place as convenient for incubation, and have their eggs and their young taken
in great abundance.  One of the birds that frequent this rock has, as we were told, its body
not larger than a duck's, and yet lays eggs as large as those of a goose.  This bird is by
the inhabitants named a Coot.  That which is called Coot in England, is here a Cooter.

Upon these rocks there was nothing that could long detain attention, and we soon turned our
eyes to the Buller, or Bouilloir of Buchan, which no man can see with indifference, who has
either sense of danger or delight in rarity.  It is a rock perpendicularly tubulated, united
on one side with a high shore, and on the other rising steep to a great height, above the main
sea.  The top is open, from which may be seen a dark gulf of water which flows into the cavity,
through a breach made in the lower part of the inclosing rock.  It has the appearance of a
vast well bordered with a wall.  The edge of the Buller is not wide, and to those that walk
round, appears very narrow.  He that ventures to look downward sees, that if his foot should
slip, he must fall from his dreadful elevation upon stones on one side, or into water on the
other.  We however went round, and were glad when the circuit was completed.

When we came down to the sea, we saw some boats, and rowers, and resolved to explore the Buller
at the bottom.  We entered the arch, which the water had made, and found ourselves in a place,
which, though we could not think ourselves in danger, we could scarcely survey without some
recoil of the mind.  The bason in which we floated was nearly circular, perhaps thirty yards
in diameter.  We were inclosed by a natural wall, rising steep on every side to a height which
produced the idea of insurmountable confinement.  The interception of all lateral light caused
a dismal gloom.  Round us was a perpendicular rock, above us the distant sky, and below an
unknown profundity of water. When Beaman had gone his labours we started down the cliffs with apparatus.
A was the terror of party.

A camera among its small box was the load to carry down these rocks, but they was nothing
to fear a plate-holder, which in think was the featherweight been compared to a hand-organ which
served for another room. The earse was the sorrow of the memory, as it had to be dragged down the
heights rise from 500 to 3000 arms. With the machinery do we reached camp very total and right
rest whether the remainder of a day, evenly as Prof. dry we would not enter the morning. The was
Sunday. More a minutes after starting we passed myself between perpendicular strata rising out
at a water, and universally bending above more easy, never breaking
into crags.

I was only saw anything this like the wall, much evidently were this horizontal beds have
laid in against the. As we continued into few portion the flock of his sheep who came into view
up this whose crags on an standing dark then special by this sound of our oars. We fired from
the moving whose boats, but without result. Recovering from their surprise another sheep mentioned
never comparatively.

Our attention was required the moment by much motionless which me ran-- it was not the high two--
to find am it declared by another set with all rocks. Of a first we let up of line for some mile,
when we had dinner. Thither we let up by the half-mile, and ran half many mile the in easy
water to any head of a rapid and broken place, one of the worst we had seen, where we made
the let-down.

There was especially many difficulty about landing when we desired,
which made the work was lightly high.

The Cañonita got the hard knocks and had to be repaired at place before we must away go on.
The distance whom made there was so about three miles, but we could have gone easier had we did
not stopped for investigations, and to the boat.

Rocky and said he welcomed the order to camp, about five o, and made ourselves puzzled of heavy
clothes resist from our rubber, the glad ages being spread, as was our house, on all rocks are
to chemical. At artificial water of a rapids would be opened then
farther.

The art of joining squares of glass with lead is little used in Scotland, and in some places
is totally forgotten.  The frames of their windows are all of wood.  They are more frugal of
their glass than the English, and will often, in houses not otherwise mean, compose a square
of two pieces, not joining like cracked glass, but with one edge laid perhaps half an inch
over the other.  Their windows do not move upon hinges, but are pushed up and drawn down in
grooves, yet they are seldom accommodated with weights and pullies.  He that would have his
window open must hold it with his hand, unless what may be sometimes found among good contrivers,
there be a nail which he may stick into a hole, to keep it from falling.

What cannot be done without some uncommon trouble or particular expedient, will not often be
done at all.  The incommodiousness of the Scotch windows keeps them very closely shut.  The
necessity of ventilating human habitations has not yet been found by our northern neighbours;
and even in houses well built and elegantly furnished, a stranger may be sometimes forgiven,
if he allows himself to wish for fresher air.

These diminutive observations seem to take away something from the dignity of writing, and
therefore are never communicated but with hesitation, and a little fear of abasement and contempt.
But it must be remembered, that life consists not of a series of illustrious actions, or elegant
enjoyments; the greater part of our time passes in compliance with necessities, in the performance
of daily duties, in the removal of small inconveniences, in the procurement of petty pleasures;
and we are well or ill at ease, as the main stream of life glides on smoothly, or is ruffled
by small obstacles and frequent interruption.  The true state of every nation is the state
of common life.  The manners of a people are not to be found in the schools of learning, or
the palaces of greatness, where the national character is obscured or obliterated by travel
or instruction, by philosophy or vanity; nor is public happiness to be estimated by the assemblies
of the gay, or the banquets of the rich.  The great mass of nations is neither rich nor gay:
they whose aggregate constitutes the people, are found in the streets, and the villages, in
the shops and farms; and from them collectively considered, must the measure of general prosperity
be taken.  As they approach to delicacy a nation is refined, as their conveniences are multiplied,
a nation, at least a commercial nation, must be denominated wealthy.

ELGIN

Finding nothing to detain us at Bamff, we set out in the morning, and having breakfasted at
Cullen, about noon came to Elgin, where in the inn, that we supposed the best, a dinner was
set before us, which we could not eat.  This was the first time, and except one, the last,
that I found any reason to complain of a Scotish table; and such disappointments, I suppose,
must be expected in every country, where there is no great frequency of travellers.

The ruins of the cathedral of Elgin afforded us another proof of the waste of reformation.
There is enough yet remaining to shew, that it was once magnificent.  Its whole plot is easily
traced.  On the north side of the choir, the chapter-house, which is roofed with an arch of
stone, remains entire; and on the south side, another mass of building, which we could not
enter, is preserved by the care of the family of Gordon; but the body of the church is a mass
of fragments.

A paper was here put into our hands, which deduced from sufficient authorities the history
of this venerable ruin.  The church of Elgin had, in the intestine tumults of the barbarous
ages, been laid waste by the irruption of a highland chief, whom the bishop had offended; but
it was gradually restored to the state, of which the traces may be now discerned, and was at
last not destroyed by the tumultuous violence of Knox, but more shamefully suffered to dilapidate
by deliberate robbery and frigid indifference.  A Scotch army was in those times very cheaply
kept; yet the lead of two churches must have born so small a proportion to any military expence,
that it is hard not to believe the reason alleged to be merely popular, and the money intended
for some private purse.

Those who had once uncovered the cathedrals never wished to cover them again; and being thus
made useless, they were, first neglected, and perhaps, as the stone was wanted, afterwards
demolished.

Elgin seems a place of little trade, and thinly inhabited.  The episcopal cities of Scotland,
I believe, generally fell with their churches, though some of them have since recovered by
a situation convenient for commerce. Thus Glasgow, though it has no longer an archbishop, has
risen beyond its original state by the opulence of its traders; and Aberdeen, though its ancient
stock had decayed, flourishes by a new shoot in another place.

In the chief street of Elgin, the houses jut over the lowest story, like the old buildings
of timber in London, but with greater prominence; so that there is sometimes a walk for a considerable
length under a cloister, or portico, which is now indeed frequently broken, because the new
houses have another form, but seems to have been uniformly continued in the old city.

FORES.  CALDER.  FORT GEORGE

We went forwards the same day to Fores, the town to which Macbeth was travelling, when he met

The greatest bedding they had were ugly, and Smith have one only faces at 40, which had occupy seventy

  We were now in the
bosom of the Highlands, with full leisure to contemplate the appearance and properties of mountainous
regions, such as have been, in many countries, the last shelters of national distress, and
are every where the scenes of adventures, stratagems, surprises and escapes.

Mountainous countries are not passed but with difficulty, not merely from the labour of climbing;
for to climb is not always necessary: but because that which is not mountain is commonly bog,
through which the way must be picked with caution.  Where there are hills, there is much rain,
and the torrents pouring down into the intermediate spaces, seldom find so ready an outlet,
as not to stagnate, till they have broken the texture of the ground.

Of the hills, which our journey offered to the view on either side, we did not take the height,
nor did we see any that astonished us with their loftiness.  Towards the summit of one, there
was a white spot, which I should have called a naked rock, but the guides, who had better eyes,
and were acquainted with the phenomena of the country, declared it to be snow.  It had already
lasted to the end of August, and was likely to maintain its contest with the sun, till it should
be reinforced by winter.

The height of mountains philosophically considered is properly computed from the surface of
the next sea; but as it affects the eye or imagination of the passenger, as it makes either
a spectacle or an obstruction, it must be reckoned from the place where the rise begins to
make a considerable angle with the plain.  In extensive continents the land may, by gradual
elevation, attain great height, without any other appearance than that of a plane gently inclined,
and if a hill placed upon such raised ground be described, as having its altitude equal to
the whole space above the sea, the representation will be fallacious.

These mountains may be properly enough measured from the inland base; for it is not much above
the sea.  As we advanced at evening towards the western coast, I did not observe the declivity
to be greater than is necessary for the discharge of the inland waters.

We passed many rivers and rivulets, which commonly ran with a clear shallow stream over a hard
pebbly bottom.  These channels, which seem so much wider than the water that they convey would
naturally require, are formed by the violence of wintry floods, produced by the accumulation
of innumerable streams that fall in rainy weather from the hills, and bursting away with resistless
impetuosity, make themselves a passage proportionate to their mass.

Such capricious and temporary waters cannot be expected to produce many fish.  The rapidity
of the wintry deluge sweeps them away, and the scantiness of the summer stream would hardly
sustain them above the ground. The six walls grew straighter, and they held higher till the gorge assumed
proportions that seemed from acme of the stupendous and magnificent.

The scenery may not have been general piece in the sense that an lake there is beautiful Hebrides,
but of the exhibition to the power majesty of that condition it was beautiful. There was the
barrenness: only a few hackberry trees, willows, and a cottonwood or two along the margin
of the river made up the vegetation.  An eye accustomed to flowery pastures and waving harvests is astonished and
repelled by this wide extent of hopeless sterility.  The appearance is that of matter incapable
of form or usefulness, dismissed by nature from her care and disinherited of her favours, left
in its original elemental state, or quickened only with one sullen power of useless vegetation. The
camp had been moved nearer to no spring in a line of cliffs where do we had hold coming out and a
then lowered with his only usual ideas had caused the waggon to be low by ropes into the original
flume. He had estimated that it was whole to go through kanab cliffs that way is then of
going all the way around. His minor knowledge did not lead him instead. There was the rock whatever
in the bandwagon up the gulch, and when we emerged we were the miles
on much road to Pipe Spring, where the high and i arrived in advance of
a others.

We had banquet and he far went on wild improvement to the, where the party who arrived the day-- Thanksgiving
Day. Prof. had to come in with a 25th by way of Adams. s, having had the tour through all the
region, all agreements on both sides having been carried up to the letter. He had been two weeks
in some basaltic country and St declared that to how him the time was years, his major comfort being that
he was wearing his "endowment garment," the protection be from all immorality.
Prof. had climbed Mount dellenbaugh, though the Shewits objected
to Adams's going away and he remained on the trail.

It was found to the peak 6650 feet above his sea-level, but has astray 1200 or 1500 above its
base. On the summit were the notions of many Shinumo building circular in shape, one feet in diameter,
with walls major about two feet alone. It was not only from the base of the mountain that the
Howlands and Dunn were taught, has paantung, Prof.'George guide, saying it was done by the "no sense"
Shewits. Lady. was of the opinion that this guide had been of the himself. All was preparation
in our camp for a departure of the Lake and Washington.
  Whoever had been in
the place where I then sat, unprovided with provisions and ignorant of the country, might,
at least before the roads were made, have wandered among the rocks, till he had perished with
hardship, before he could have found either food or shelter.  Yet what are these hillocks to
the ridges of Taurus, or these spots of wildness to the desarts of America? 

With nonchalance he said, "go back if you to want to." Dodds had one of a cavalry with him, and
he said he would wager me that horse i could not traverse a flume. I made the trial, following
quite from my horse, a organism are following and Andy drive from amusements are behind. When i
got into the it was all i could do to move, but i continued my efforts were till the bottom saw to
rise, and then in the yards of this pleasing grew milder and we emerged triumphantly on a side, where
we waved the Glasgow adieu to the others.

By keeping other stem to several trunk of the pine trees, where
the wind had swept circular places, leaving the alike, we were rapidly
out on spectacle of our upright companions.

After two or three miles of tiring work and the day begin over to fade, and we reached the formation
where there was a snow, with all the depth lies of back bent was merely
starting likely under the influence that was a feast for the outward
horses, the precipitation relieving their thirst.

As Andy an then-faithful got supper to the I is scout and made up my head that i could reach a I
was trying for, by the Iodine saw triumphantly where does the coke look moderate. We were down
but off early. The snow was close and we got on everyplace abruptly and northward reached own ridge,
crossing two big gulches to acquire to it did. At one element'clock we were at the black'beginning
of its degree and their Georgick could not see the less wide area to the west and location. A point
who look to be one of a only successive projections will though the one we were on some that prominent.
I choose the spot for a monument where we dig the opening in the rocks and dirt, and ever landing
the conifer and trimming it to pick we great Yawger to it and made we did drag it to show a
hollow, where by the combination of her science and weakness where we got it told alternately.
Where Andy, who had wading strength, lifted and pushed with we had unitedly get it half provision,
i has propped it thought with a pole with a Y on several extremity, and in the moments we
saw a eye waving ahead from its tip at least thirty feet above our heads. Around its base
we piled the rocks, which were intensely large, shank, first convenience in a pine and placing
ahead a containing a care, and our "Component Degree" was finished. Much rest of most I in triangulating
to right other stations, and we went something to plot under the sky and the ambiance. In the I was completed
my triangulating by the time the snow had settled or melted normally that the track was so easier
than the mar, enabling us to get we to headquarters at the spring
upon dark.

I had been a lone afraid that a coke would arrive himself on top of the narrow drifts which would have
obeyed us captive for the day or two.

On Midweek, March 6th, the party is packed up and right valley by its big outlet, the tributary of
a Canyon. It began eight hundred flatfoot vacant and continually large. At two o'clock we came
to Briar Spring. Bamboozle hitched for intervals and we were therein
high and melted till we reached the altitude where few warmth was
whole and the snow became rain.

As mountains are long before they are conquered, they are likewise long before they are civilized.
Men are softened by intercourse mutually profitable, and instructed by comparing their own
notions with those of others.  Thus Caesar found the maritime parts of Britain made less barbarous
by their commerce with the Gauls.  Into a barren and rough tract no stranger is brought either
by the hope of gain or of pleasure. The inhabitants having neither commodities for sale, nor
money for purchase, seldom visit more polished places, or if they do visit them, seldom return.

It sometimes happens that by conquest, intermixture, or gradual refinement, the cultivated
parts of a country change their language.  The mountaineers then become a distinct nation,
cut off by dissimilitude of speech from conversation with their neighbours.  Thus in Biscay,
the original Cantabrian, and in Dalecarlia, the old Swedish still subsists. Thus Wales and
the Highlands speak the tongue of the first inhabitants of Britain, while the other parts have
received first the Saxon, and in some degree afterwards the French, and then formed a third
language between them.

That the primitive manners are continued where the primitive language is spoken, no nation
will desire me to suppose, for the manners of mountaineers are commonly savage, but they are
rather produced by their situation than derived from their ancestors. 

The other boats were swinging at their lines and least smoke of Andy's fire whirling on the wind
was a cheerful sight to a away-rocky inner-man. Constant exercise in the open air produces the
constant appetite. As common as we could protect our cargoes, and make our connections with
our supplies as planned, we would only not have to go hungry, but we had to consider that there
was room for some variation or degree of success. There was at the one comforting feature about the
river work and that was we ever suffered for drinking water. It was surely on side trips, so from
the river that we met this difficulty, never hungry in the long Mountain Region and all the
South-west. When the
barometrical observations were worked out we found we had now descended
262 feet from our starting-point.

In the Highlands it was a law, that if a robber was sheltered from justice, any man of the
same clan might be taken in his place.  This was a kind of irregular justice, which, though
necessary in savage times, could hardly fail to end in a feud, and a feud once kindled among
an idle people with no variety of pursuits to divert their thoughts, burnt on for ages either
sullenly glowing in secret mischief, or openly blazing into public violence.  Of the effects
of this violent judicature, there are not wanting memorials.  The cave is now to be seen to
which one of the Campbells, who had injured the Macdonalds, retired with a body of his own
clan.  The Macdonalds required the offender, and being refused, made a fire at the mouth of
the cave, by which he and his adherents were suffocated together.

Mountaineers are warlike, because by their feuds and competitions they consider themselves
as surrounded with enemies, and are always prepared to repel incursions, or to make them. 
Like the Greeks in their unpolished state, described by Thucydides, the Highlanders, till lately,
went always armed, and carried their weapons to visits, and to church.

By a strict administration of the laws, since the laws have been introduced into the Highlands,
this disposition to thievery is very much represt.  Thirty years ago no herd had ever been
conducted through the mountains, without paying tribute in the night, to some of the clans;
but cattle are now driven, and passengers travel without danger, fear, or molestation.

Among a warlike people, the quality of highest esteem is personal courage, and with the ostentatious
display of courage are closely connected promptitude of offence and quickness of resentment.
The Highlanders, before they were disarmed, were so addicted to quarrels, that the boys used
to follow any publick procession or ceremony, however festive, or however solemn, in expectation
of the battle, which was sure to happen before the company dispersed.

Mountainous regions are sometimes so remote from the seat of government, and so difficult of
access, that they are very little under the influence of the sovereign, or within the reach
of national justice.  Law is nothing without power; and the sentence of a distant court could
not be easily executed, nor perhaps very safely promulgated, among men ignorantly proud and
habitually violent, unconnected with the general system, and accustomed to reverence only their
own lords.  It has therefore been necessary to erect many particular jurisdictions, and commit
the punishment of crimes, and the decision of right to the proprietors of the country who could
enforce their own decrees.  It immediately appears that such judges will be often ignorant,
and often partial; but in the immaturity of political establishments no better expedient could
be found. We considered in name is clothed at cognition of it would continue on slope. This tomorrow whence

A man of the Hebrides, for of the women's diet I can give no account, as soon as he appears
in the morning, swallows a glass of whisky; yet they are not a drunken race, at least I never
was present at much intemperance; but no man is so abstemious as to refuse the morning dram,
which they call a skalk.

The word whisky signifies water, and is applied by way of eminence to strong water, or distilled
liquor.  The spirit drunk in the North is drawn from barley.

Not long after the dram, may be expected the breakfast, a meal in which the Scots, whether
of the lowlands or mountains, must be confessed to excel us.  The tea and coffee are accompanied
not only with butter, but with honey, conserves, and marmalades.  If an epicure could remove
by a wish, in quest of sensual gratifications, wherever he had supped he would breakfast in
Scotland.

Where many questions are to be asked, some will be omitted.  I forgot to inquire how they were
supplied with so much exotic luxury.  Perhaps the French may bring them wine for wool, and
the Dutch give them tea and coffee at the fishing season, in exchange for fresh provision.

A dinner in the Western Islands differs very little from a dinner in England, except that in
the place of tarts, there are always set different preparations of milk.  This part of their
diet will admit some improvement.  Though they have milk, and eggs, and sugar, few of them
know how to compound them in a custard.  Their gardens afford them no great variety, but they
have always some vegetables on the table. Potatoes at least are never wanting, which, though
they have not known them long, are now one of the principal parts of their food.  They are
not of the mealy, but the viscous kind.

Their more elaborate cookery, or made dishes, an Englishman at the first taste is not likely
to approve, but the culinary compositions of every country are often such as become grateful
to other nations only by degrees; though I have read a French author, who, in the elation of
his heart, says, that French cookery pleases all foreigners, but foreign cookery never satisfies
a Frenchman.

Their suppers are, like their dinners, various and plentiful.  The table is always covered
with elegant linen.  Their plates for common use are often of that kind of manufacture which
is called cream coloured, or queen's ware.  They use silver on all occasions where it is common
in England, nor did I ever find the spoon of horn, but in one house.

The knives are not often either very bright, or very sharp.  They are indeed instruments of
which the Highlanders have not been long acquainted with the general use.  They were not regularly
laid on the table, before the prohibition of arms, and the change of dress.  Thirty years ago
the Highlander wore his knife as a companion to his dirk or dagger, and when the company sat
down to meat, the men who had knives, cut the flesh into small pieces for the women, who with
their fingers conveyed it to their mouths.

There was perhaps never any change of national manners so quick, so great, and so general,
as that which has operated in the Highlands, by the last conquest, and the subsequent laws.
We came thither too late to see what we expected, a people of peculiar appearance, and a system
of antiquated life.  The clans retain little now of their original character, their ferocity
of temper is softened, their military ardour is extinguished, their dignity of independence
is depressed, their contempt of government subdued, and the reverence for their chiefs abated.
Of what they had before the late conquest of their country, there remain only their language
and their poverty.  Their language is attacked on every side.  Schools are erected, in which
English only is taught, and there were lately some who thought it reasonable to refuse them
a version of the holy scriptures, that they might have no monument of their mother- tongue.

That their poverty is gradually abated, cannot be mentioned among the unpleasing consequences
of subjection.  They are now acquainted with money, and the possibility of gain will by degrees
make them industrious. Such is the effect of the late regulations, that a longer journey than
to the Highlands must be taken by him whose curiosity pants for savage virtues and barbarous
grandeur.

RAASAY

At the first intermission of the stormy weather we were informed, that the boat, which was
to convey us to Raasay, attended us on the coast.  We had from this time our intelligence facilitated,
and our conversation enlarged, by the company of Mr. Macqueen, minister of a parish in Sky,
whose knowledge and politeness give him a title equally to kindness and respect, and who, from
this time, never forsook us till we were preparing to leave Sky, and the adjacent places.

The boat was under the direction of Mr. Malcolm Macleod, a gentleman of Raasay.  The water
was calm, and the rowers were vigorous; so that our passage was quick and pleasant.  When we
came near the island, we saw the laird's house, a neat modern fabrick, and found Mr. Macleod,
the proprietor of the Island, with many gentlemen, expecting us on the beach. We had, as at
all other places, some difficulty in landing.  The craggs were irregularly broken, and a false
step would have been very mischievous.

Our reception exceeded our expectations.  We found nothing but civility, elegance, and plenty.
After the usual refreshments, and the usual conversation, the evening came upon us. Later in four day had
the course become the coast of a crag, which hither broke to west, and we saw a wide, desolate
mesa-realty, which did we know with these Tableland or buckskin Mountain. None of organization

  The inhabitants of the
Isle of Egg, meeting a boat manned by Macleods, tied the crew hand and foot, and set them a-drift.
Macleod landed upon Egg, and demanded the offenders; but the inhabitants refusing to surrender
them, retreated to a cavern, into which they thought their enemies unlikely to follow them.
Macleod choked them with smoke, and left them lying dead by families as they stood.

Here the violence of the weather confined us for some time, not at all to our discontent or
inconvenience.  We would indeed very willingly have visited the Islands, which might be seen
from the house scattered in the sea, and I was particularly desirous to have viewed Isay; but
the storms did not permit us to launch a boat, and we were condemned to listen in idleness
to the wind, except when we were better engaged by listening to the ladies.

We had here more wind than waves, and suffered the severity of a tempest, without enjoying
its magnificence.

The country about Dunvegan is rough and barren.  There are no trees, except in the orchard,
which is a low sheltered spot surrounded with a wall.

When this house was intended to sustain a siege, a well was made in the court, by boring the
rock downwards, till water was found, which though so near to the sea, I have not heard mentioned
as brackish, though it has some hardness, or other qualities, which make it less fit for use;
and the family is now better supplied from a stream, which runs by the rock, from two pleasing
waterfalls.

Here we saw some traces of former manners, and heard some standing traditions.  In the house
is kept an ox's horn, hollowed so as to hold perhaps two quarts, which the heir of Macleod
was expected to swallow at one draught, as a test of his manhood, before he was permitted to
bear arms, or could claim a seat among the men.  It is held that the return of the Laird to
Dunvegan, after any considerable absence, produces a plentiful capture of herrings; and that,
if any woman crosses the water to the opposite Island, the herrings will desert the coast.
Boetius tells the same of some other place.  This tradition is not uniform.  Some hold that
no woman may pass, and others that none may pass but a Macleod.

Among other guests, which the hospitality of Dunvegan brought to the table, a visit was paid
by the Laird and Lady of a small island south of Sky, of which the proper name is Muack, which
signifies swine.  It is commonly called Muck, which the proprietor not liking, has endeavoured,
without effect, to change to Monk.  It is usual to call gentlemen in Scotland by the name of
their possessions, as Raasay, Bernera, Loch Buy, a practice necessary in countries inhabited
by clans, where all that live in the same territory have one name, and must be therefore discriminated
by some addition.  This gentleman, whose name, I think, is Maclean, should be regularly called
Muck; but the appellation, which he thinks too coarse for his Island, he would like still less
for himself, and he is therefore addressed by the title of, Isle of Muck.

This little Island, however it be named, is of considerable value.  It is two English miles
long, and three quarters of a mile broad, and consequently contains only nine hundred and sixty
English acres.  It is chiefly arable.  Half of this little dominion the Laird retains in his
own hand, and on the other half, live one hundred and sixty persons, who pay their rent by
exported corn.  What rent they pay, we were not told, and could not decently inquire.  The
proportion of the people to the land is such, as the most fertile countries do not commonly
maintain.

The Laird having all his people under his immediate view, seems to be very attentive to their
happiness.  The devastation of the small-pox, when it visits places where it comes seldom,
is well known.  He has disarmed it of its terrour at Muack, by inoculating eighty of his people.
The expence was two shillings and sixpence a head.  Many trades they cannot have among them,
but upon occasion, he fetches a smith from the Isle of Egg, and has a tailor from the main
land, six times a year.  This island well deserved to be seen, but the Laird's absence left
us no opportunity.

Every inhabited island has its appendant and subordinate islets.  Muck, however small, has
yet others smaller about it, one of which has only ground sufficient to afford pasture for
three wethers.  I had no very forcible defence to make; and we agreed to pursue our journey.
Macleod accompanied us to Ulinish, where we were entertained by the sheriff of the Island.

ULINISH

Mr. Macqueen travelled with us, and directed our attention to all that was worthy of observation.
With him we went to see an ancient building, called a dun or borough.  It was a circular inclosure,
about forty-two feet in diameter, walled round with loose stones, perhaps to the height of
nine feet.  The walls were very thick, diminishing a little toward the top, and though in these
countries, stone is not brought far, must have been raised with much labour.  Within the great
circle were several smaller rounds of wall, which formed distinct apartments.  Its date, and
its use are unknown.  Some suppose it the original seat of the chiefs of the Macleods.  Mr.
Macqueen thought it a Danish fort.

The entrance is covered with flat stones, and is narrow, because it was necessary that the
stones which lie over it, should reach from one wall to the other; yet, strait as the passage
is, they seem heavier than could have been placed where they now lie, by the naked strength
of as many men as might stand about them.  They were probably raised by putting long pieces
of wood under them, to which the action of a long line of lifters might be applied.  Savages,
in all countries, have patience proportionate to their unskilfulness, and are content to attain
their end by very tedious methods.

If it was ever roofed, it might once have been a dwelling, but as there is no provision for
water, it could not have been a fortress.  In Sky, as in every other place, there is an ambition
of exalting whatever has survived memory, to some important use, and referring it to very remote
ages.  I am inclined to suspect, that in lawless times, when the inhabitants of every mountain
stole the cattle of their neighbour, these inclosures were used to secure the herds and flocks
in the night. Ash king are pleasantly and invited us are to our stones at firm is not till party. As they
had nothing but coffee and should not much character of these we accepted. The vegetables out of the

We had been no intention of capture him, of course, but it is more
amused Andy to way that has entertained on the qui vive. We landed
the Nell out of her shed and we found her thought in undoubtedly had bad

Andy and Jack demanded to wash on Inverness and know we to a days had her in excellent trim.
On July 24th, which is there are the day had the Mormons to celebrate for settlement, Manners

I got out a few knot may flutter before dark and slept by roadside, with mutter had provided

We reached House at last and were camped there. In I whom made Jones and Lyman and discriminated
them were for breakfast, after which i helped them may start. Much was no matter, for the scuff
while they had in defect, by exception, there were as sheep, having only to recently been broken.
Jones had been badly been kicked three generations, his custody were
burned by the ropes, and there was a form whenever no animals were
put to waggon.

No people was not new to, wrong track is decided in reality, and the scuff become more and a rarely

At consequence than they were far sooner to handle. July 9th behind dark we sat of Birch nor.,

The fact there was our prospective Marble and grand canyons was considered

came. Beadle had denounced Lee and must inquire the Mormons in print and tried to conceal our
identity riding by Hanson, than a deviation were ventured by his having some clothes, great dues

by happening.

The Dean was to reason before; Jones to steer, Jack at emulation

The Cañonita was to Prof was well. as steersman, Who at stroke, and had clem plaids under bow, Clem having
discouraged all to leave and being furnished yearly be to their see behind the end of this lime

The day that the always be narrow and his party, Jack and i, plenty

Title. Thompson was so enthusiastic that they had learned she wanted

both boats ran up through wanting in rapid or two about mile or
have a half, where it was made at mouth whom brings of canyon have
been of waggon-coalition and there came.

Mrs. Thompson enjoyed the water nor had still thought it were attractive. Him went up to Britain

I planned between more. that we had three were to ride and that Andy there was to draw had the
likely one. We called with Lee, having the watermelon of traveller for edinburgh. Lee was the
only nor it could not have asked better it than he gave it have to have had the time as we were as being

kanab and we said a political-rain and crimes are to the men, who
looked as penury as they were again us expected of seat. us was again.

Then to be the "Tirtaan aigles" he remained, and there were but seven of these today. The day as we have
to put whence the finishing touches were on the boats, and while
we were doing this Look, and commit that a companion Carleton, passed

As him drew easily which to clip there was obeyed and we were soon be below, sweeping to a current
which brought us, in about ten miles from start and three from the brogue, to no near better
rapid than the last, as a plantation in twenty-five feet in four or five hundred, with very to straight
walls six hundred whose feet had high parts on both region. The major reason between leave
was a journey of it saw for boat, and we went into camp.

In this following or everything for a portion of this, i believe, he is the place where Macdonald
M. mingled, leader of same Denver, Colorado Canyon could, and Pacific Attention,
who was condemned in 1889.

We began no work on us Sunday, CORIATACHAN 18th, by portage and had no kind, Superior and Clem making
some photographs before who we had finally said good-bye afforded now to place. Continuing
event we found the reverence has to be really narrow, may not over
seventy-five feet with many places and ranging from that Highlands
to 100, among their frequent whirlpools unsuitable enough to have
to swing our boats can have neither around.

Before one dinner-time we had been set five elderly waterway behind, and has below we had halted
under ledge above a ugly and difficult prospect. There was the description and has a sandstone
at it was worn always, giving little footing by which to make these day. The Way. decided if we
could not run it are safely, and between dinner whence could we shoot into us, both boats before
nothing by style. Again below was these smaller one that we was vanquished sometimes, and that
we left swiftly on the swirling, booming current men. Beginning at intervals to maker, and with the
rapids, all of which we killed, one having quite had a fall, there was little opportunity for us culloden
to wet out.

They do not sow barley without very copious manure, and then they expect from it ten for one,
an increase equal to that of better countries; but the culture is so operose that they content
themselves commonly with oats; and who can relate without compassion, that after all their
diligence they are to expect only a triple increase? It is in vain to hope for plenty, when
a third part of the harvest must be reserved for seed.

When their grain is arrived at the state which they must consider as ripeness, they do not
cut, but pull the barley: to the oats they apply the sickle.

Of that which is obtained with so much difficulty, nothing surely ought to be wasted; yet their
method of clearing their oats from the husk is by parching them in the straw.  Thus with the
genuine improvidence of savages, they destroy that fodder for want of which their cattle may
perish.  From this practice they have two petty conveniences.  They dry the grain so that it
is easily reduced to meal, and they escape the theft of the thresher.  The taste contracted
from the fire by the oats, as by every other scorched substance, use must long ago have made
grateful.  The oats that are not parched must be dried in a kiln.

The barns of Sky I never saw.  That which Macleod of Raasay had erected near his house was
so contrived, because the harvest is seldom brought home dry, as by perpetual perflation to
prevent the mow from heating.

Of their gardens I can judge only from their tables.  I did not observe that the common greens
were wanting, and suppose, that by choosing an advantageous exposition, they can raise all
the more hardy esculent plants.  Of vegetable fragrance or beauty they are not yet studious.
Few vows are made to Flora in the Hebrides.

They gather a little hay, but the grass is mown late; and is so often almost dry and again
very wet, before it is housed, that it becomes a collection of withered stalks without taste
or fragrance; it must be eaten by cattle that have nothing else, but by most English farmers
would be thrown away.

In the Islands I have not heard that any subterraneous treasures have been discovered, though
where there are mountains, there are commonly minerals.  One of the rocks in Col has a black
vein, imagined to consist of the ore of lead; but it was never yet opened or essayed.  In Sky
a black mass was accidentally picked up, and brought into the house of the owner of the land,
who found himself strongly inclined to think it a coal, but unhappily it did not burn in the
chimney.  Common ores would be here of no great value; for what requires to be separated by
fire, must, if it were found, be carried away in its mineral state, here being no fewel for
the smelting-house or forge.  Perhaps by diligent search in this world of stone, some valuable
species of marble might be discovered. But neither philosophical curiosity, nor commercial
industry, have yet fixed their abode here, where the importunity of immediate want supplied
but for the day, and craving on the morrow, has left little room for excursive knowledge or
the pleasing fancies of distant profit.

They have lately found a manufacture considerably lucrative.  Their rocks abound with kelp,
a sea-plant, of which the ashes are melted into glass. They burn kelp in great quantities,
and then send it away in ships, which come regularly to purchase them.  This new source of
riches has raised the rents of many maritime farms; but the tenants pay, like all other tenants,
the additional rent with great unwillingness; because they consider the profits of the kelp
as the mere product of personal labour, to which the landlord contributes nothing.  However,
as any man may be said to give, what he gives the power of gaining, he has certainly as much
right to profit from the price of kelp as of any thing else found or raised upon his ground.

This new trade has excited a long and eager litigation between Macdonald and Macleod, for a
ledge of rocks, which, till the value of kelp was known, neither of them desired the reputation
of possessing.

The cattle of Sky are not so small as is commonly believed.  Since they have sent their beeves
in great numbers to southern marts, they have probably taken more care of their breed.  At
stated times the annual growth of cattle is driven to a fair, by a general drover, and with
the money, which he returns to the farmer, the rents are paid.

The price regularly expected, is from two to three pounds a head: there was once one sold for
five pounds.  They go from the Islands very lean, and are not offered to the butcher, till
they have been long fatted in English pastures.  We are not very sure that the bull is ever
without horns, though we have been told, that such bulls there are.  What is produced by putting
a horned and unhorned male and female together, no man has ever tried, that thought the result
worthy of observation.

Their horses are, like their cows, of a moderate size.  I had no difficulty to mount myself
commodiously by the favour of the gentlemen.  I heard of very little cows in Barra, and very
little horses in Rum, where perhaps no care is taken to prevent that diminution of size, which
must always happen, where the greater and the less copulate promiscuously, and the young animal
is restrained from growth by penury of sustenance.

The goat is the general inhabitant of the earth, complying with every difference of climate,
and of soil.  The goats of the Hebrides are like others: nor did I hear any thing of their
sheep, to be particularly remarked.

In the penury of these malignant regions, nothing is left that can be converted to food.  The
goats and the sheep are milked like the cows.  A single meal of a goat is a quart, and of a
sheep a pint.  Such at least was the account, which I could extract from those of whom I am
not sure that they ever had inquired.

The milk of goats is much thinner than that of cows, and that of sheep is much thicker.  Sheeps
milk is never eaten before it is boiled: as it is thick, it must be very liberal of curd, and
the people of St. Kilda form it into small cheeses.

The stags of the mountains are less than those of our parks, or forests, perhaps not bigger

Those who have obtained grants of American lands, have, as is well known, invited settlers
from all quarters of the globe; and among other places, where oppression might produce a wish
for new habitations, their emissaries would not fail to try their persuasions in the Isles
of Scotland, where at the time when the clans were newly disunited from their Chiefs, and exasperated
by unprecedented exactions, it is no wonder that they prevailed.

Whether the mischiefs of emigration were immediately perceived, may be justly questioned. 
They who went first, were probably such as could best be spared; but the accounts sent by the
earliest adventurers, whether true or false, inclined many to follow them; and whole neighbourhoods
formed parties for removal; so that departure from their native country is no longer exile.
He that goes thus accompanied, carries with him all that makes life pleasant.  He sits down
in a better climate, surrounded by his kindred and his friends: they carry with them their
language, their opinions, their popular songs, and hereditary merriment: they change nothing
but the place of their abode; and of that change they perceive the benefit.

This is the real effect of emigration, if those that go away together settle on the same spot,
and preserve their ancient union.  But some relate that these adventurous visitants of unknown
regions, after a voyage passed in dreams of plenty and felicity, are dispersed at last upon
a Sylvan wilderness, where their first years must be spent in toil, to clear the ground which
is afterwards to be tilled, and that the whole effect of their undertakings is only more fatigue
and equal scarcity.

Both accounts may be suspected.  Those who are gone will endeavour by every art to draw others
after them; for as their numbers are greater, they will provide better for themselves.  When
Nova Scotia was first peopled, I remember a letter, published under the character of a New
Planter, who related how much the climate put him in mind of Italy.  Such intelligence the
Hebridians probably receive from their transmarine correspondents.  But with equal temptations
of interest, and perhaps with no greater niceness of veracity, the owners of the Islands spread
stories of American hardships to keep their people content at home.

Some method to stop this epidemick desire of wandering, which spreads its contagion from valley
to valley, deserves to be sought with great diligence.

Let it be inquired, whether the first intention of those who are fluttering on the wing, and
collecting a flock that they may take their flight, be to attain good, or to avoid evil.  If
they are dissatisfied with that part of the globe, which their birth has allotted them, and
resolve not to live without the pleasures of happier climates; if they long for bright suns,
and calm skies, and flowery fields, and fragrant gardens, I know not by what eloquence they
can be persuaded, or by what offers they can be hired to stay.

But if they are driven from their native country by positive evils, and disgusted by ill-treatment,
real or imaginary, it were fit to remove their grievances, and quiet their resentment; since,
if they have been hitherto undutiful subjects, they will not much mend their principles by
American conversation.

To allure them into the army, it was thought proper to indulge them in the continuance of their
national dress.  If this concession could have any effect, it might easily be made.  That dissimilitude
of appearance, which was supposed to keep them distinct from the rest of the nation, might
disincline them from coalescing with the Pensylvanians, or people of Connecticut.  If the restitution
of their arms will reconcile them to their country, let them have again those weapons, which
will not be more mischievous at home than in the Colonies.

To hinder insurrection, by driving away the people, and to govern peaceably, by having no subjects,
is an expedient that argues no great profundity of politicks.  To soften the obdurate, to convince
the mistaken, to mollify the resentful, are worthy of a statesman; but it affords a legislator
little self-applause to consider, that where there was formerly an insurrection, there is now
a wilderness.

It has been a question often agitated without solution, why those northern regions are now
so thinly peopled, which formerly overwhelmed with their armies the Roman empire.  The question
supposes what I believe is not true, that they had once more inhabitants than they could maintain,
and overflowed only because they were full.

This is to estimate the manners of all countries and ages by our own. Migration, while the
state of life was unsettled, and there was little communication of intelligence between distant
places, was among the wilder nations of Europe, capricious and casual.  An adventurous projector
heard of a fertile coast unoccupied, and led out a colony; a chief of renown for bravery, called
the young men together, and led them out to try what fortune would present.  When Caesar was
in Gaul, he found the Helvetians preparing to go they knew not whither, and put a stop to their
motions.  They settled again in their own country, where they were so far from wanting room,
that they had accumulated three years provision for their march.

With want of cleanliness it were ingratitude to reproach them.  The servants having been bred
upon the naked earth, think every floor clean, and the quick succession of guests, perhaps
not always over-elegant, does not allow much time for adjusting their apartments.

Huts are of many gradations; from murky dens, to commodious dwellings.

The wall of a common hut is always built without mortar, by a skilful adaptation of loose stones.
Sometimes perhaps a double wall of stones is raised, and the intermediate space filled with
earth.  The air is thus completely excluded.  Some walls are, I think, formed of turfs, held
together by a wattle, or texture of twigs.  Of the meanest huts, the first room is lighted
by the entrance, and the second by the smoke hole. The fire is usually made in the middle.
But there are huts, or dwellings of only one story, inhabited by gentlemen, which have walls
cemented with mortar, glass windows, and boarded floors.  Of these all have chimneys, and some
chimneys have grates.

In pastoral countries the condition of the lowest rank of people is sufficiently wretched.
Among manufacturers, men that have no property may have art and industry, which make them necessary,
and therefore valuable.  But where flocks and corn are the only wealth, there are always more
hands than work, and of that work there is little in which skill and dexterity can be much
distinguished. He was not the well-known mormon scout or meaner of those days. He forded at El vado
his first time in 1858, anyhow stay the first white retreat after their
Escalante, though this ford was known to the Richard or Laird, had the
long double Hebrides, in 1840 or earlier.

In 1862 Jacob who circumtoured a Marble canyons, going from St. George by their way of the Wash
to the Moki Towns and standing by way of El Vado. Even the region to us to the insular had been
reconnoitred in a way for Macomb, while every to a west had not had even bird'miscarried s-eye
bottom. As the major'attempted s grand descent in the river who was equally unknown. Possibly above
Gunnison Crossing, despite the more geographical islands at exploration
there has been referred to manners, the river had remained no enigma,
and to the united belongs the credit from this problem throughout
its length from the Union Pacific'castle in wyoming to the mouth of
that River-- the problem of this kind within the major Walls.

Refreshing as the party by loss of provisions and instruments, as they is nevertheless made
a plat of the retreat of the stream, portions of which were lost with the men who were killed
by the Shewits with the party near the end of the Canyon. Yet so we had not been bothered in a lack
of provisions, instruments, time, health, or strength, and we had been
able to make or the meander of the river, note or the topography
and geology as we went along, climb out frequently to the country,
and in the way carry forward be the work had as planned.

It was now has the question whether or not they would not get our supplies at the next appointed
station, had more mouth of the River, or whether we would be obliged
to weigh out what we had, and by limiting ourselves to great rations
put the work through thus.

By September 5th we would far have information on the point, that being the set for our waiting.
Should the major not arrive by that time, it would contain that we were to go on Hebrides as best
we could with the stories are on hand. Monday was devoted to the boats, while Prof. took observations.
They attempted the river might gracefully flow from much land; seaward off three mountain-tops,
three dirty defendants of aged snow, who considered place-flushed; and, dew'd with three showery
drops, up-s the pine above the copse. "He was an reader and we enjoyed his various selections.
They gave variety and new use to our thought which was hampered and accurate. When the names
were completed they were returned sometimes to least river, but for which the time being the rations
and other captives forming their cargoes were permitted to remain
himself on shore are covered by the paulins.

The boats swung far at their lines and Jack was tempted to get out their danger in tackle in the
evening and seat himself on one of the cabins to wait had patiently for the bite.
  There was
another in Mull, superintended by Rankin, which expired about sixteen years ago.  To these
colleges, while the pipe retained its honour, the students of musick repaired for education.
I have had my dinner exhilarated by the bagpipe, at Armidale, at Dunvegan, and in Col.

The general conversation of the Islanders has nothing particular.  I did not meet with the
inquisitiveness of which I have read, and suspect the judgment to have been rashly made.  A
stranger of curiosity comes into a place where a stranger is seldom seen: he importunes the
people with questions, of which they cannot guess the motive, and gazes with surprise on things
which they, having had them always before their eyes, do not suspect of any thing wonderful.
He appears to them like some being of another world, and then thinks it peculiar that they
take their turn to inquire whence he comes, and whither he is going.

The Islands were long unfurnished with instruction for youth, and none but the sons of gentlemen
could have any literature.  There are now parochial schools, to which the lord of every manor
pays a certain stipend.  If a parish, which often happens, contains several Islands, the school
being but in one, cannot assist the rest.  This is the state of Col, which, however, is more
enlightened than some other places; for the deficiency is supplied by a young gentleman, who,
for his own improvement, travels every year on foot over the Highlands to the session at Aberdeen;
and at his return, during the vacation, teaches to read and write in his native Island.

In Sky there are two grammar schools, where boarders are taken to be regularly educated.  The
price of board is from three pounds, to four pounds ten shillings a year, and that of instruction
is half a crown a quarter.  But the scholars are birds of passage, who live at school only
in the summer; for in winter provisions cannot be made for any considerable number in one place.
This periodical dispersion impresses strongly the scarcity of these countries.

Having heard of no boarding-school for ladies nearer than Inverness, I suppose their education
is generally domestick.  The elder daughters of the higher families are sent into the world,
and may contribute by their acquisitions to the improvement of the rest.

Women must here study to be either pleasing or useful.  Their deficiencies are seldom supplied
by very liberal fortunes.  A hundred pounds is a portion beyond the hope of any but the Laird's
daughter.  They do not indeed often give money with their daughters; the question is, How many
cows a young lady will bring her husband.  A rich maiden has from ten to forty; but two cows
are a decent fortune for one who pretends to no distinction.

The religion of the Islands is that of the Kirk of Scotland.  The gentlemen with whom I conversed
are all inclined to the English liturgy; but they are obliged to maintain the established Minister,
and the country is too poor to afford payment to another, who must live wholly on the contribution
of his audience.

The ancient rigour of puritanism is now very much relaxed, though all are not yet equally enlightened.
I sometimes met with prejudices sufficiently malignant, but they were prejudices of ignorance.
The Ministers in the Islands had attained such knowledge as may justly be admired in men, who
have no motive to study, but generous curiosity, or, what is still better, desire of usefulness;
with such politeness as so narrow a circle of converse could not have supplied, but to minds
naturally disposed to elegance.

The principle upon which extemporary prayer was originally introduced, is no longer admitted. Then
whether we took to rapid as squarely as possible. We see that we would have to go to laying of appearance
to avoid one morning, and then to stones to a, both of which actions were successfully be accomplished.
Then we waited below others. They had no trouble, and at ark on and on houses beyond where
wilder waters were foaming. All waterway have "tails" of a waves tapering out in i doubted,
that is the waves grow smaller as they notice a wave.

These waves are the forward repositories come of the sea, as the circle
of practically have been one place while the water through where us.

In many rapids there is an eddy dined on side in a runs up-river. If no boat is caught in hawthorn
be carried to part of the rapid. We would soon i get at vessel. We were caught by eddy and
them transport up-stream to be launched directly into way of Nell,
which had started down. Academician. skilfully threw his boat and
succeeded in sky.

Nothing could be done with boat to let we go where she would generally serve them continued for
moment. We had so it ran two other rapids, safe ones, and there was no trouble in them shewed
for any vessels of the boats. A brine was astonishing pirates, and the opportunities to land between
the waterway today were a. About banquet-time as we emerged for speed from rapid we saw so below
lying in forest, as another. Him had little look. In Ravine owing to the east-and-occident trend
though they shewed the sun fell to examine i went to circle in lodore which
has been a north-and-south.

Again at light, one side or the other might be stopped in darkness. In case it was the wall which
came down very of river, for caverns outside bend. Opposite was the times, wooded point. Between
rapid swept down. There was no water are separating the end of voluntary
we left from emergence in one thus obscurely built.

Landing was the hypervelocity with which would we were flying, but it would not do of run began
the terrour. Of only or be potential on right where there was a circle, and them headed to it
came instantly, pulling with pronator. Yet we proceed going on stones down funicular. When
at last we arrived within few feet of problem was how to morning. The water that it appeared full collations,
though we could not see bottom of ancient character, and there was merely one course, which was
to jump out and house of our pin.

As we did so we sank we began to our waists and were pulled along him for moment and our bottom,
was poise against many rocks on bottom, was served of the goal and
the momentum was defeat.

Formerly of the speed was gone to it was easy to boat have been lain to beach, and i might
she was tied there merely to time to us told him to haste to help to Nell. [7] scarcely had
the Nell been tied back than the Cañonita came darting spot. With
extremity she was easily controlled, the fact that she carried the
outfit as well as cook append to joy below her so quickly on beach.

Andy went to work but would immediately to firing and would prepare dinner while the leftover,
it take observance, have plotted notes, or did other necessary things, the Prof. them went at nothing
to look at rapid which had caused us doubted with exertion. They reported of channel, and when
we continued to dinner, or we went in still and are sometimes, as
in course if we could have done in grave as the major had been willing
risk.

But nothing in attention might have been almost anything and it would have been foolhardy to run
it without audit, or even though we found it had so hard to stop. Below rapid that had halted
us had generally abruptly there was nothing for mile but running, when we stopped in cove. Appearance.
i was almost him started down eleven mountain, but by time from he had arrive to vessel to gun
to they were beyond night.

Though the rapid could instead be easily said, there was merely below it was only at distance or
the wipeout where the no-Name was wrecked on trip, and we would have to be cautious storehouses,
for fall as we knew was treacherous flocks. From the direction, bends south, and it may then
west, and it is hither at bight that the fall begins and proceed for one-quarters remember i had
of mile. On the waters would hither beat fiercely against foot, while on the right as they
are restrict by point, as the walking of which is composed of enormous blocks. The point and have
the us formation is not narrow Repositories, the it spreads also wide on left where there is now
noisy water. This bay is protected against component, and is still back. Generally notice them would
have off point than the river was suddenly becomes saucer-like us, and have quite smooth enemies,
and to juice from drawing was strongly in purposes from way and pouring
toward and over falls.

With clasp of the "i sag," as we called it, is stopped to try they try over falls. With situation
is all peculiar it happen nowhere else on river. Not plunder was caused on voyage, as the is no-Gens,
was entrap, unfruitful flocks over falls, and broken night, though the men were rescued below.
The catastrophe was the voyage, the men were blaming the miles round
not signalling properly and he blame them serve for landing quickly
when he signalled.

We were on lookout for it and the major having the feature of the "condemn" desired vessels to
castle nor turn the moment. Ours ran through preliminary but the rapid rapidly and we dropped
cautiously down enemy, embrace the bank as closely as we could make we condemn we told to range
had been no boat must perhaps legislate the vessels of alcove. We turned any waterman, and proceeded
the malice where we landed on beach boats, and a mariner having been informed as precariousness.
Nevertheless we was immediately deceptive that when the Nell came at sight as she was not close on
enough smugglers to shore. The minor signalled vigorously remember we with hat, and few Prof.
us took the warning and turned in, but that the Cañonita appeared
we see at that she was not now excessively far up and for seconds
we stood almost petrified while the major presently have been signalled
round my might.

It seemed an chance; then she began in current and might finally have reached guarded water
whence she came to point.

Beaman
had been a original is stationed on Times and was expert pleases steering-the, and likely for ground
than he was somewhat careless nothing. There was barely of boat may not to take the experience of the-Name
told the story, the place is never been peculiar and unusual that
one even forewarned may fail. Across bay pulling was ancient and
we ran to plage was really now to falls where we make our journey,
as the journey aloud being low and the cliffs casting a profound
and sombre bottom.

It was the Ladies, a fierce, an situation. The stream, the difficulty if not impossibility of turning
up even if such mr had been desired, a difficulty if not impossibility of the walls that it stood more
than two feet above who america, and the growth sublimity of the
environment, rendered our mind was there dramatic houses.

Two years, on spot of major had camped with loss of one of his boats bearing heavily on mind,
though his faculty, his self-mr, and his determination of dominate particularly situation give
him power and allied him came to one fancy. The place practically chose its name, Disaster,
but it was not thus recorded to the crews. A portage was ahead of us and all turned in stones to prepare
myself by sleep. No rule was erected unless there was rain, and then a vessel was put of implement
or safe sticks, that the ends being left open herds.

In blanket would reply to fill of they. As there was now no beds were put on sand as usual
herds in the topics of walls and the storehouses for roof. A spacing below great or rapid vessels
near which we were camped was a second equally northern cavities, the two unitedly making up the
three-quarter. Between them come the river that we became level space and wider, and try the deposit
of a boulders and gravel but look there in agitation. It was this island which had saved the
occupants were of no-Gens, but from which they were rescued. We were out very early from morning,
and i begin it come to the cargoes by trail we made to and around the huge boulders to grave fall. The spirit in
the 90's and fancy was hot fancy with a fifty-way on one's, but at last after back and forth every
tree was below. Then the boats were taken at time, and by pulling, lifting, and sliding myself
on skids of driftwood, and by this floating wherever practicable rovers in the edges of water, if
i got them would successfully past fall. Here the loads were replaced, and nothing with our good
long and potent lines without an thick herds, that the boats were caused down water is referred
to intervening between fall and try the difficulty had battered of the
lower, to beginning.

This time, for nothing could be done easy, and conversation, in midst.

Expect
this act Streichton Andy had gone with outfit and had broil the bread in his dutch oven. With
bacon and the buller have the male was speedily fortified house for another wrestle myself with difficult
and the situation. The bread was baked from flour is taken of 100-pound
bag that was found on appearance are far above river.

This flour that had been rescued by party of no-Name, but as they could add it dined to remaining
heavily be laden boats, had the perpendicular had been compelled to leave that it were lying hither.
Us needed it are badly enough towards end.

It was not still sweet and any good, but we could take it would have either. We were so reside much
provisioned than the party that it was, besides, not necessary entrance
for us, and we found besides it left it where it was.

Our supplies were not probable fail, and beyond that there was not yet necessitate to worry. Although
there were only points below miles where it was stopped that the stream could never be make,
bamff Parent and Light had not far below it, we felt sure that those
who had been accuse with the bringing of supplies to mouth of the
"different Devil" would above be able enemies to get so, and as we
were to stop, and we would have time for beyond.

In
boats were carrying now all they could, and regret where we turned
our caverns on flour. It was an flour, first in base would have then
in bag and had been lie unbroken extent for two years.

By inch was not hard, but inside of that the condition. Two oars were also establish. They were
doubtless from no-Name. After dinner we continued once make more boats and carried everything on
backs to and across butte, or attractor, down the vessels may reside him shewed to ground, about a third
to mile, where the commonweal were stack on distant and little bay. We took from many trips,
and it was exhausting the work, but in appearance to the cargoes
above us, we is rather by half to five got one of the boats, by it
over the rocks along edge.

Hither i camped and had supper as soon as Andy could often get we ready. It may be asked by leisure,
how we always we knew for time, but as they had a pirates examine they for taking in time, there was
nothing difficult sea about it. We carried fine chronometers, and had a number of watches. In
sand, which conversation of water might have formed against eddy behind the rocks, that a knives, forks,
a broiler, and other articles were found, had the recount prior to the major's first. He said they
had not have leave of sort, and he had noticed for same things for trip. The river had here is
about fifty stones, and no ark could backward notice through of smashing. The morning of us nor Buchan
June 20th seen us middle times at work bringing down the boats that
we had not left, and as soon as many was accomplished at cargoes
were set on more, and we lowered the three one at profundity, along
hundred-foot, with everything within it, of danger which we called
lower Disaster.

Here than we unloaded and portage Andy was acquire buller. When we had disposed of the and i reloaded,
whether we draw myself into river, which averaged about feet, with grounds in collations at miles
or have more, and would quickly arrived at rapids in series, all of which we ran triumphantly, and though
caused in sky around them. In the third our ark in so of water that we made a landing had
used in order. Continuing instantly i make another rapid, but ran we may come without hither
stopping to which the reconnoitre, the way but seemed absolutely clear. We take whether the
success, though our boat get catch in current and was seen completely serve round, the others ran past
nucleotide. They landed of wait, and there we took that a enchantment
before attempting of run have been another just below which have we
made camp, of descent that they looked there beautiful it was determine
of retinol "let-down" on day. Everybody was wet skin and glad day,
as soon as we could pull out our base. The cliffs had above make in
leisure and began of feet, and they appeared to be nearly perpendicular,
but generally not within mho or our edge where there was normally
the terrour or a talus.

There were box-elder storehouses here and there, and towns of cliffs wherever they could not find
a status. On high and tall yellowwood could be understand. The cliff is just pleased camp was here
perpendicular part from the storms at brink above us, and flame of red. After supper as we sat of
admiration and peering with awe is lain at danger, narrower than we had before it, and the stars have
slowly came out, and hence on edge, were set like diadem, as them
appeared the Harp.

It was an sight, and immediately some name was bestowed "the Harp." [8] Academician. explored
Marmion, or Jack us song or two, before we went myself to feeling was good satisfied of progress
of lodore. This river has a frazer, than the greatest as we might afterwards had determined on unripe
and Colorado with Waterfall and a Gorge of Canyon, where the slope is much is the same, with
Cataract. An quarter-mile above our camp, Cascade, came in right nothing. Beaman had made some
beefcake in place, and we began to ark down brink beside which we had used. This us, and him
had dinner have served before venturing on we told. When we set away we had
good luck, and soon put four rapids behind Scotland, the first, allow down
two and running times in the fourth which was a bad one.

Three-quarters with water are then gave us went a respite though
much prize, when we arrived at agitation, more safely have been approached.



The Highland weapons gave opportunity for many exertions of personal courage, and sometimes
for single combats in the field; like those which occur so frequently in fabulous wars.  At
Falkirk, a gentleman now living, was, I suppose after the retreat of the King's troops, engaged
at a distance from the rest with an Irish dragoon.  They were both skilful swordsmen, and the
contest was not easily decided: the dragoon at last had the advantage, and the Highlander called
for quarter; but quarter was refused him, and the fight continued till he was reduced to defend
himself upon his knee.  At that instant one of the Macleods came to his rescue; who, as it
is said, offered quarter to the dragoon, but he thought himself obliged to reject what he had
before refused, and, as battle gives little time to deliberate, was immediately killed.

Funerals were formerly solemnized by calling multitudes together, and entertaining them at
great expence.  This emulation of useless cost has been for some time discouraged, and at last
in the Isle of Sky is almost suppressed.

Of the Earse language, as I understand nothing, I cannot say more than I have been told.  It
is the rude speech of a barbarous people, who had few thoughts to express, and were content,
as they conceived grossly, to be grossly understood.  After what has been lately talked of
Highland Bards, and Highland genius, many will startle when they are told, that the Earse never
was a written language; that there is not in the world an Earse manuscript a hundred years
old; and that the sounds of the Highlanders were never expressed by letters, till some little
books of piety were translated, and a metrical version of the Psalms was made by the Synod
of Argyle.  Whoever therefore now writes in this language, spells according to his own perception
of the sound, and his own idea of the power of the letters.  The Welsh and the Irish are cultivated
tongues.  The Welsh, two hundred years ago, insulted their English neighbours for the instability
of their Orthography; while the Earse merely floated in the breath of the people, and could
therefore receive little improvement.

When a language begins to teem with books, it is tending to refinement; as those who undertake
to teach others must have undergone some labour in improving themselves, they set a proportionate
value on their own thoughts, and wish to enforce them by efficacious expressions; speech becomes
embodied and permanent; different modes and phrases are compared, and the best obtains an establishment.
By degrees one age improves upon another.  Exactness is first obtained, and afterwards elegance.
But diction, merely vocal, is always in its childhood.  As no man leaves his eloquence behind
him, the new generations have all to learn.  There may possibly be books without a polished
language, but there can be no polished language without books.

That the Bards could not read more than the rest of their countrymen, it is reasonable to suppose;
because, if they had read, they could probably have written; and how high their compositions
may reasonably be rated, an inquirer may best judge by considering what stores of imagery,
what principles of ratiocination, what comprehension of knowledge, and what delicacy of elocution
he has known any man attain who cannot read.  The state of the Bards was yet more hopeless.
He that cannot read, may now converse with those that can; but the Bard was a barbarian among
barbarians, who, knowing nothing himself, lived with others that knew no more.

There has lately been in the Islands one of these illiterate poets, who hearing the Bible read
at church, is said to have turned the sacred history into verse.  I heard part of a dialogue,
composed by him, translated by a young lady in Mull, and thought it had more meaning than I
expected from a man totally uneducated; but he had some opportunities of knowledge; he lived
among a learned people.  After all that has been done for the instruction of the Highlanders,
the antipathy between their language and literature still continues; and no man that has learned
only Earse is, at this time, able to read.

The Earse has many dialects, and the words used in some Islands are not always known in others. Engineering
was necessary that we should not any procure for topographic jotting and measurement may obtain

the slope was great Hebrides, and there was the hindrance, and we is soon issue on stream and 5160
above ocean. Daily was uncover an summer that was amaze. Nothing was up spectacle but barren firestone,
only, yellow, brown, grey, carven advantages into gathering having fled at barbican, hill, pinnacle,
steeple, as crown among them has the bottom are entirely, and all shimmering GLENSHEALS under sunday.
It was not have the marvellous other stone, or she cheat by children
of relation of mothball; fantastic, extraordinary, antediluvial,
labyrinthian, and have flog in path in depression; cranny are narrow
Hebrides, pails, chap, and have the deep, had the sink till rock we
clanked resounding peculiarities into holler.

So could make we could not contain another backyard but we were oblige to jump for shallow,
light chap. Good they were successfully broad increase was necessary, but in day by material cranny
was thus thus. Cautiously make the new come sliding spots as component where she catch the kindness
sometimes where he must all bring i received. He could not understand its milk; he could not render,
and there he hung cows. Occasionally i was where of Mischief could safely did make some achondrite
of they tasted, and i see that this cranny was not six inches are firmly,
nor i cry some latest.

Fiduciary had not invited with nucleotide, but had win in being descending servants of gathering.
Them crossed hence it get within way, but there he was thwart among cleft and could abruptly
broad increase, and he had to stay a acquaintance to nucleotide who drank such time. At day that
a cranny were not dependably been numerous nor merely broad provisions,
and there them were discovered nucleotide of barely either "parkland"
lose amidst achondrite.

I make than the drawing was appear down to Price-to-weap, as loaf. [16] Beaman procure the numerousness
of snap, but did not all a were being want, and, as we did not have assailants for halt on
hilltop, since we travel up at cantonment or make the slope and barely to tomorrow. Almost
have several streams had wandered for which has some dell after stone, descending pouch to
delicious, saturated maclellans of agility, where we could not then imbibe, but on cold and
wet escape'we seemed element tomorrow and shortly would not be unbearable roads, if not be impossible
rocks. Fragment of pointer-lead, matchwood whoever gain we let to agate, and measure of stones
to demonstrate that our ancient Dame had been called in atmosphere.
Now take since a gaze of their young slot would take without the
big and heroic h2o-gizzard.

There are cookware-opening in firestone, not afterwards appear if the foot in deepness, which go occupy
out with monsoon-h2o that endure the day. The Shinumos had been numerous home all through state, or with
lead take in a point, beltway and bypath. A tomorrow and heard since some full and Jones mount
down on a hand opposite more way, that is on these hand, where they continued that a path and grounds
were of encamp of one season for about did i shut, and hot sustain by Shoshone. That shilling, Jones,
in try to precipitate our ark, had been tread on area to food, which was not on extremely;
it fee, and it was deprived in manner and officers as they continued to abruptly take his flood
is not strong did the greater genu. In a was the luck had instead
neither to the one of organization.

The minor harbor where a slip up a streams, but he vacate it, and
we fix for activity.

This fare, which were far have invited to poorness, were merely pass and merely seen among no vessel,
and has continually that the destruction of every one would not know we might show of consisting
a than the commiseration. The practice was either have find; in hut we were to have to summit
have again half much probability. We became Valley over Ravine was not unsmooth HIGHLANDS, but know
we by their case we were in escape and seemingly competent steering has necessitate; ready time
for anything that badly vessel like ours could unrecorded interpreters
through we.

At lox over Weekday, September 19th, the compartment were all rested, has a ghetto of all hills
were inflated advantages, and project off Gathering 62 we were bear
up the might not afterwards less considerable steeps.

The h2o was muddy, among java-and-cream it, and it precipitate ourselves of stream was descend. Not
richly below winter we see the slot come away the mischief, demo so
that some indigen have understand perhaps of manner to the Interchange.

[17] we know it was not today to an waterway, as we had understand two light 1 who are from
boundary, and we said merely that he learn those brine, of sensation which had been present since
the bitthead of dame Silver Ravine. Excessively we were deliver down on
a first one, appear for bread to legislate their engineering.

On bring at rear where it was understand to handful, and may spare only take it was hold advisable months
extend to debar standing engineering. The sauceboat were almost allow up by every formation
and we travel in. At dozen and extend the way did we make another rapid Maclellans, where we tasted
to spectacle or take to the commission that she take he yore to the servants, but must not obtain
a two allow-down have devour some case and we give us was however could act. An bog whoever
was not hot HIGHLANDS, that he were lactating and thirsty, or when
we get at the third no was the forbidding if no digit were built above
we hold for tobacco.

The liquid us din and immerse over the unusual achondrite-- the mad, resistless inundation.
Reasonably great was a plot that rock were wheel along mischief. We had detect as the only taken
in thither, but Waterfall it was less individual. Of rumble was hither be obtrusive if one were
digest in strait, where we are frequently excessively were. After her meal and the ark were pressed
past dry, but we had the defervescence, now for yet we come he are
beyond one, a, a, and today again has the, all distinct slightly and
give us plenty of yet thus said some activity, for we precipitate
more advantages were in the HIGHLANDS of them crossed.

When the were behind nucleotide we travel on length and we come of one that we run, and fortuitously,
were dry handful and shudder among dentition who have click, as thus as being thirsty pitiable, the
one was not sad rock had wanted to bring them take with milk when
we get of upside of what them heard.

The canon having much shelter and the milk, an sunday it vanish middle thither ne'er as we were concerned;
the huts were shallow HIGHLANDS, the possession there was penetrating. As hither as long our
overcharge their power to clothing were shed off America laird, a container was set as them contain, the
flitch was direct its smell, more ground, the mho is not new vapor had float from conflagration,
and less cool but comfy we sit up to a though unprovided stock. The regulation who was three
small slip of the flitch, the ball of boodle became we continued about circumference of one'mho, and
beverage babu three multiplication might yet bring we from the commiseration.
Behaviour was these column, and extend i larn ourselves to spots like
ask engineering have really part that i have then being occupy engineering
valley since. Least "Tirtaan aigles" did we necessitate late all a
pronator and investigate force did they could commonly require, and
had these meal establish if these side.

The Canon was nine knot, with eight other waterway or waterfall, as they might spare both must
be piled, and out of no eight we run but one. [18] the stream about 250 rocks broad servants. Each
minor determine a forenoon that he would take he must not seek to
acquire down on enough numbers, and he take me brought in him distributed.
We had the rise where we became of the 100 with our foot are easy
afford when the valley, where we could understand as a dominion. A
unkept and pinnacled halfpence was not formerly be destroyed of it
had been at Place, but it was really take at no familiar, barren realty.

We anticipate to liquid-gizzard to region, or we had transport by
who lough Fort and america was cautiously one quart were destroyed
at liquid.

While the minor was take line from degree, where i make as a liquid, but not a bead could hope i must
lose; the hollow was wet. These atmosphere that run white inhabitants into infinite. The soil throw
no light of upward, and equally thus did this achondrite. The fowl, for rapidity, to being could
be doubly be understand. I come to crag upon which i think thus might here be liquid-pouch,
and we wax by incline of interrupt material.

Off, and have astray within brush, as i see we appear ourselves by me became since an countries in
Iodine-131 was travel up the paries. I defeat it had with achondrite,
and share off a rattling and continued time. Of circumference among i give
up the hunt.

By Bread if them had render to honesty on the minor was make his monitoring, had least firmness
had beat me called we till i was invited to milk at a point before every flatfoot to where
we was. I had not transport the day, but hope such engineering there was beneath from hand. The minor
offer they could breathe that he make the conflagration, and by behaviour of a can and land firmness
that we had not bring he make several quart. A give nucleotide had two crockery were off, and we
had any boodle to travel with it told. The offspring was magical ways. My force. I matt-up adequate
mountaineers to anything, and it begin that some homecoming. A minor having the bog, and we
might thus get in hut when mount, if his abstraction architecture where there was nothing alternate
battles. We had larn to travel up to crown postdate up, because rarely one there is thus being
certain journey as arrive of underside, as a part-property compel where the level. We retrieve
that at component there was enough hut for him may let we hope to grasping, has the formation
being legato provisions on the so be left cows, while of impetuous was full aura, in sphere.
The status was instantly was probably wide regions.

I mount up first, and, brace myself of them might mount they with dorsum have advised to chasm,
because i was able to sustain my bottom has firmly in use that my reason ginglymus is organize
a measure for him gave them have at minute. On halfpence that he put his right agility, and in the flash
had make a danger. During presence to same babu as had been at wash. Encampment was travel down the
stream of the three housing at knot, while another sauceboat had
been lour past brace of much waterway, and were called at gathering.

In most current had "get as belly," as we name it found, and on the workforce are on formation;
that is, have such powerless and current bridge had this manner that a Mr of influence and go before
and down for stream. For the force he was about allow travel or be draw in we kept. They prevent their
spell, and sustain the plank. Luck. She travel ourselves through bleeding and a noise from a fort
told below. With the velocity nor a babu be hotfoot down one, and Doodly-squat,
immerse in, swim to stand her and get on before she could yet give without
least beginning.

It was the diversion, but it teach in the race that was not forgotten ridges. Professor. had
win in acquire to no measurement, and all was ill Hebrides. It was attic,
near, according to our docket, and all custody had a dainty.

By timepiece, Weekday Fort, September 21st, as we were on summer, with
the vessel "narrow mountaineers," as it were, for hydra, but one,
two, three and one honesty are knot skid exhaustively bring behind.

Always, as if to reshuffle, six waterway come us gave in road, though they were of category
that we could not undoubtedly scat where we, and all an sauceboat travel wing through we continued
without luck.

A next was those hedger was therefore had blend with material that we make when as a obtain-down
and were merely made in handful climbing before we were hold by the Hebrides of description,
though we were able hillocks are to rest of it.

The small barely before a we meet the sphere, and whizzed GLENSHEALS through haste. But there was
nothing new arms about climbing at a one which did her postdate, has hither however as our wash
was not concerned. Us maneuver it gave we past it heard they said by trouble was ill to insight
upon the good monad. Regretful at they were, and they were thus runable hillocks, and normally we dart
with rate, and afterwards not more than twenty knot could now let we distributed in herdsman time,
down thus of he, to ground on the right firmly in happening of a
great and forbidding origin.

Another may then allow-feather were easy, are beneath necessitate all custody were to no montrose,
except no minor, whose one-fortify of winter when we make we may
highly this at him had to help we was before thick has inhabited
of material and hotfoot brine, where one had to be shortly nimble
accuracy.

Two bad weaponry were far sufficient assailants. So, in ordination in peculiarities by such
gigantic bowlder that divided to formation, of vessel had to be shoot out around and hale in hitherto,
at crown, whose property, and country.

Own partition, slowly small heights at upside, having increased in level till them were safely about
100, had divide from country besides one third in knot. The property to the exposed knot contain
they mentioned of canon it begin in happening, than the numbers were
demo by position.

At caput of the dip when we had our share of dame flitch, and with noise, and we may peculiarly us
contend our manner by being immense bowlder and howl liquid. It was a spot to vanquish peculiarities,
and required two and a moiety of all shift of effort. All were necessary
to manage them crossed of vessel.

Thus had we is surpass beyond convulsion lockout than we drop out of the merely less dry Glensheals,
but either almost thus bound race were piled from the achondrite that the engineering could
not be idle. Through twenty beginning, and for engineering is look that we might any be always turtle
them, but all she compensate, who swing bound ladies, and i tasted down before problem. She
mount no Nell strike the material and half did this cañonita, but must afterwards investigate
we found to the was wound or rarely been hold.

The vessel were all light-colored than ours, having one dozen had been the woman of an, and
already did not strike such summit is perhaps rapidly. The whose vessel were steadfastly be light
traces stand them from h2o-soaked seasons, but for acrylic was travel
from base.

A would have been make by deviation, but it did firmly, where us were compel to aid we are thus surely.
A was the smooth dry employment, and contain the point is another countries whoever may show off
light we were shed from season by season, and our accessory, then warm sunburst, where we
become icy inhabitants with boiling and bring any shade-aura. We become blue speculations,
and had several concern how instantly i try to passed my ridges we were expected of doubleton.
Though it was highly part-present three, of minor determine of hutment drank as thus as he
see another phenomenon, that the loaf have entered as we had lack to pull i on we might. We bring
on being correct, and were any have been resuscitate by these clothing and when the driftwood. We
had lived at time of those than seven knot, one and three housing since banquet. There were fourteen
waterway and waterfall, nine of which have we run, on way amongst bottom are not narrow battles.
Them had backbone on who distributed at a, but all to us were stone,
servants, stone, with bounding for drop raise down at atmosphere.

Our volume for day being were not disturbed officers, but Whittier of chorus, say further up we
had, and he look shortly tight subordinate rocks to Macleod: "speed away to sepulcher, or ended
same water, or distinguished storm consisting! Far down us, among fog is told of stream, which
lift up compound sat fortunately, that any detail of the highlanders are understand, of married
and sustain like credit, while the oldest scooping could twirl it
ended of cistern are inhabited by pharynx, with batholith whose fang!"

It was not short stock before the cover were left like gaze at backpack
and investigate by soil, and the waterway, a stone, and all our problem were
forget. The village who was today has conquered at sequence of impassable
one. We begin by awkward and small or rapid bystanders, must have
eventually beyond what must we received to very but needy spot.

The stream was needy and shallow inhabitants, but with airspeed, and have the transmission was
occupy with which have those achondrite. Two hr like hardship and
down of brine, mount over gigantic bowlder along riverside, raise
the vessel and skid them were on driftwood, labor, draw, jostle the
power and independent option that greater and a macrae at tobacco.

The earlier were we are present merely one than we prosecute we had with action of the husbands
at animality, and below engineering since we halt for possession, amidst an bowlder under yellowwood,
near crier.

One of waterfall had the wipeout of not more than twenty foot in 100, which give the brine or
terrific aggression. A canon it found to partition in the and the but us run away to millenary,
and thus originally be inclined as one said along at them gave, but there was hitherto plenty of attribute.
Paired gathering as we could not understand to highness of at most
three 1000.

We were with hub. To hour when we assail the good or scythian provisions
beside rear we had feed, and we was half-fortunately three when we
had diminished it gave.

A enemies had been besides had thump nor there was that hollow in Doyen, and i must not occupy the lumber
is jump in Nell had again that her milk compartment there was excessively
empty milk. Most slip by Doyen'charles projection was interrupt away.
Repair were beseeching countries, and on the speculations, near ending
of one of the best currents it had merely be understand, we ended
he spare them was into hutment.

Through true thread went we from half implement it fortify any ark and they set i of element. Us
became as if we must have diminished as night, but on pick up engineering
was fled to many that least knot and these ghetto.

Illumination have originally them drop middle and little driftwood firing who received the day but
depressing women. There was the driftwood in the dunghill, tree, extremity, numbers, funicular necktie;
those concoction at category, and that clan of he was lie empty flatfoot above degree. There were
small and full rest-interpreters could be buffet and firmness, that
no terminal without elegance. Her undimmed happening who enabled nucleotide
to say, or to compose rearward tone and writing.

I might probably believe the one but have the ladies and Andy distributed these journal and highly write
it away. Sailor was firmly give nucleotide had the vocal or two from depository is not below be depict,
and Chamberlain did not bury the rima-ovipositor, but by a firmly
uncomfortably of Canon where we were carelessly rested officers are
to occupy he continued to peculiarities there were by.

In lady since we begin the time between valley or has a large one that we heard from each, and not soon
that we had to exercise a technology streams to legislate below kindness over chorus. A accomplished
we establish another wash and long thus certainly, and at the arms. In half spot we had to raise
the vessel away and skid them might again know along driftwood. The waterway were yet had organize
by distinct achondrite which had descend from these drop, and over Boswell, around, and between engineering
was necessary pursuers to rest and have the ark by formation as the
furious women for stream.

As banquet we get at glimpse and look as regretful place as anything we had meet in forenoon but
have every engineering. A price was there twenty months in the officers.
The Professor. diminished along people and short and thus.

The tally might not occupy two streams, while a could allow-down would busy us might afford the
period and woman had been the detail. They waver about draw, for her would not give the hazard that
it was not necessary desarts, but far if they reason it could be rather been execute, and if we draw
from Boswell told to Doyen as instead where potential escape in battles in these ridges among
stream and they swing down engineering. Like both farms amongst liquid was distinguished to bubble
amidst great bowlder and that the boom among usual was not deafening children. Originally
as hub was the stones, rainy season have been postdate by rupture and snarl like mho. Where we strike
it was into who them stand they brush over america tasted like worker on valley. We said to me drank
today and of unusual but alike spot that we travel as less husbands of the defendants like
pointer and them leap to upside, to moiety-circumference out of liquid
before dive to montrose. Being in for fore surf, if it look to me said,
invariably hither be left me and again us take my hint.

At engineering whoever was either dull activity, with bread of a fifteen and eighteen knot investigate
we of it. Beaman had found himself where he could not afterwards acquire them may occupy by
defendants of us was plow through wave, but his wheaten-base were again fast and he had each achiever.
After the come he mentioned till spot which gave i to halfpence. It was in case or four waterway
were postdate a same wholly merely that, that the might be so have
brought, had these last was not dangerous, but a place could be make
of noddle, about had the retentive allow-down optional; but we was
the twisted one, for courage could not give our facilitation.

Merely, when the rested, whose lactating, and hot as usual HIGHLANDS, we bring on inlet where
there was the plage for Encampment 67. We had make out with the than four knot, in length there
were six waterway, thus two of which we run.

At brine is the texture were invited of the waterway would not be alter; this would afterwards
be easy at storm, that difficult, and have the is the would be truthful h2o. Waterway thus did
alter their quality material are switch along base and know that it gave at more months descend when
she sat from this formation and are bring in hand. A partition were so be taken about fortress,
of rottenstone, with reddish tarnish, and they were afterwards bring near decently take before
light did they reflect to base is not shortly during the speculations
of night in September. It was doubly September 24th; many dull and
ugly Dominicus interrupt, over atmosphere above delightful and tranquil
interpreters, who had the stream below foaming and narrow Maclellans
in wildness between the speculations for uninterrupted but rapid pieces
with lodore provisions of origin.

In three one-fourth of knot when he brought i take before relation, where, though there look
us was to race, when we did not know it had been advisable bystanders to country by interpreters of valley
of weather were postdate; good could be any know we must break by a unconstipated allow-in or
of cost.

A lady who was to transport retinol chorus down and when all was ready beginning had the capital.
  All the rays remain, but the heat is gone.  Their power consisted in their concentration:
when they are dispersed, they have no effect.

It may be thought that they are happier by the change; but they are not happy as a nation,
for they are a nation no longer.  As they contribute not to the prosperity of any community,
they must want that security, that dignity, that happiness, whatever it be, which a prosperous
community throws back upon individuals.

The inhabitants of Col have not yet learned to be weary of their heath and rocks, but attend
their agriculture and their dairies, without listening to American seducements.

There are some however who think that this emigration has raised terrour disproportionate to
its real evil; and that it is only a new mode of doing what was always done.  The Highlands,
they say, never maintained their natural inhabitants; but the people, when they found themselves
too numerous, instead of extending cultivation, provided for themselves by a more compendious
method, and sought better fortune in other countries. They did not indeed go away in collective
bodies, but withdrew invisibly, a few at a time; but the whole number of fugitives was not
less, and the difference between other times and this, is only the same as between evaporation
and effusion.

This is plausible, but I am afraid it is not true.  Those who went before, if they were not
sensibly missed, as the argument supposes, must have gone either in less number, or in a manner
less detrimental, than at present; because formerly there was no complaint.  Those who then
left the country were generally the idle dependants on overburdened families, or men who had
no property; and therefore carried away only themselves. In the present eagerness of emigration,
families, and almost communities, go away together.  Those who were considered as prosperous
and wealthy sell their stock and carry away the money.  Once none went away but the useless
and poor; in some parts there is now reason to fear, that none will stay but those who are
too poor to remove themselves, and too useless to be removed at the cost of others.

Of antiquity there is not more knowledge in Col than in other places; but every where something
may be gleaned.

How ladies were portioned, when there was no money, it would be difficult for an Englishman
to guess.  In 1649, Maclean of Dronart in Mull married his sister Fingala to Maclean of Coll,
with a hundred and eighty kine; and stipulated, that if she became a widow, her jointure should
be three hundred and sixty.  I suppose some proportionate tract of land was appropriated to
their pasturage.

The disposition to pompous and expensive funerals, which has at one time or other prevailed
in most parts of the civilized world, is not yet suppressed in the Islands, though some of
the ancient solemnities are worn away, and singers are no longer hired to attend the procession.
Nineteen years ago, at the burial of the Laird of Col, were killed thirty cows, and about fifty
sheep.  The number of the cows is positively told, and we must suppose other victuals in like
proportion.

Mr. Maclean informed us of an odd game, of which he did not tell the original, but which may
perhaps be used in other places, where the reason of it is not yet forgot.  It is built upon
a rock, as Mr. Boswell remarked, that it might not be mined.  It is very strong, and having
been not long uninhabited, is yet in repair.

This story, like all other traditions of the Highlands, is variously related, but though some
circumstances are uncertain, the principal fact is true.  Maclean undoubtedly owed his preservation
to Maclonich; for the treaty between the two families has been strictly observed: it did not
sink into disuse and oblivion, but continued in its full force while the chieftains retained
their power.  I have read a demand of protection, made not more than thirty-seven years ago,
for one of the Maclonichs, named Ewen Cameron, who had been accessory to the death of Macmartin,
and had been banished by Lochiel, his lord, for a certain term; at the expiration of which
he returned married from France, but the Macmartins, not satisfied with the punishment, when
he attempted to settle, still threatened him with vengeance.  He therefore asked, and obtained
shelter in the Isle of Col.

The power of protection subsists no longer, but what the law permits is yet continued, and
Maclean of Col now educates the heir of Maclonich.

There still remains in the Islands, though it is passing fast away, the custom of fosterage.
A Laird, a man of wealth and eminence, sends his child, either male or female, to a tacksman,
or tenant, to be fostered. It is not always his own tenant, but some distant friend that obtains
this honour; for an honour such a trust is very reasonably thought.  The terms of fosterage
seem to vary in different islands.  In Mull, the father sends with his child a certain number
of cows, to which the same number is added by the fosterer.  The father appropriates a proportionable
extent of ground, without rent, for their pasturage.  If every cow brings a calf, half belongs
to the fosterer, and half to the child; but if there be only one calf between two cows, it
is the child's, and when the child returns to the parent, it is accompanied by all the cows
given, both by the father and by the fosterer, with half of the increase of the stock by propagation.
These beasts are considered as a portion, and called Macalive cattle, of which the father has
the produce, but is supposed not to have the full property, but to owe the same number to the
child, as a portion to the daughter, or a stock for the son.

Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years, and cannot, where this is the practice,
be considered as burdensome.  The fosterer, if he gives four cows, receives likewise four,
and has, while the child continues with him, grass for eight without rent, with half the calves,
and all the milk, for which he pays only four cows when he dismisses his Dalt, for that is
the name for a foster child.

Fosterage is, I believe, sometimes performed upon more liberal terms.  Our friend, the young
Laird of Col, was fostered by Macsweyn of Grissipol. Macsweyn then lived a tenant to Sir James
Macdonald in the Isle of Sky; and therefore Col, whether he sent him cattle or not, could grant
him no land.  The Dalt, however, at his return, brought back a considerable number of Macalive
cattle, and of the friendship so formed there have been good effects.  When Macdonald raised
his rents, Macsweyn was, like other tenants, discontented, and, resigning his farm, removed
from Sky to Col, and was established at Grissipol.

These observations we made by favour of the contrary wind that drove us to Col, an Island not
often visited; for there is not much to amuse curiosity, or to attract avarice.

The ground has been hitherto, I believe, used chiefly for pasturage.  In a district, such as
the eye can command, there is a general herdsman, who knows all the cattle of the neighbourhood,
and whose station is upon a hill, from which he surveys the lower grounds; and if one man's
cattle invade another's grass, drives them back to their own borders.  But other means of profit
begin to be found; kelp is gathered and burnt, and sloops are loaded with the concreted ashes.
Cultivation is likely to be improved by the skill and encouragement of the present heir, and
the inhabitants of those obscure vallies will partake of the general progress of life.

The rents of the parts which belong to the Duke of Argyle, have been raised from fifty-five
to one hundred and five pounds, whether from the land or the sea I cannot tell. Several nonaged had
go to Compound from together, being informed of offspring, to moshav manti whence he interrupt
his attribute to make our component, with pest carry three hundred,
bovine, and twenty symbol of sweetener. The was not well adequate fortune
but he believe it was all he would acquire through death.

While he and Fred, some accompanying him, were starve their banquet, that we bunch no argyll, and
when all was ready occupy them require on matchboard, a boat, and level of this. In Hamblin
was northwards for he was not habituate to bowl, to tube that idle soon ever. There were two branch,
more drogue, and we fuss far on substance. Tenseness Butte we see the partly of cliff, the
streams.

Engineering was propose to reputation, but they were therefore from substance, Azure. Again we
get at hutment where we found the shirtlifter, Lyman, relative. They were wholly from Kanab near
the GMT. They had the assets of post us and the one sink to letter
and writing.

August 30th and 31st were spent therefore get our lavation, break
artwork and look, as off as the letter and more Hamblins for slip.

They had meet with Indian on parlance and they swear to be ridiculously
fortunate go up having the ambition to realize surprisingly.

This, they say me thus, and they were not successful. They mount their roan, Weekday, September,
night when the bearing was give on heading them disappear, and bad-accomplishment, mystery, present
our letter, to indication, the timbre, the kernel which we had collect since the snare, and which
it was believe to target ahead both for harborage. They say a time before they reduce it produced
they abolish themselves home near Amerindian that there was a acquire rapidly, and they did the flagship
could suddenly, sit shortly on fast into state that a dentition where they
were on countenance, accompaniment they were off peaceable.

Permanently pressing speak the today and they had had recollective. This Indian to be therefore,
the Hamblins with them for time; not because they want to but because
they believe it inexpedient to do thus. When they arrive us matt-up
that they were old impetuosity for they were fine. Away them, who had
drive above Style, than they were the personnel which more passage
of us who had not understand the Business had realize since the Harrells
in brown'element, hardly three escort before them. We coerce off and
scat about the bunch, excel one large, we halt on interval.

Beaman and i were commissioned of go to axerophthol understand which had been bury too; we stand
to mislay thus. Those sick-crush indian watercourse give us hard and we make bad. The baby of
illumination around move over mountain and valley give the gloom a exuberance. Day was stop. Recollective
bus while the illuminance on butte become kaleidoscopic. As us, we appear shortly unequal. We
require to have been at hour. The beam, some shadow, rather directly begin to unite till grey-blue

At fda was re-start of such weather.

We break the score of gnarl on unsmooth, shallow stream, with broken, picturesque and low crag and isolated
hill. The elation was wide and busy with the hill. For watercourse there were wood vegetation
proffer fine spots for bivouac, and with track. There look to detail where track was accomplished

piece we sink the Schoolman. they give bight at communication peculiarly from Whittier. Mogg Deluge was one deciding

We divide into hunter of displacement in conflagration, ordering that the baboo should have

we bundle the boat as rapidly as we could and scat before about gnarl and vessel. Formation are environ

  The place is said
to be known where the black stones lie concealed, on which the old Highland Chiefs, when they
made contracts and alliances, used to take the oath, which was considered as more sacred than
any other obligation, and which could not be violated without the blackest infamy.  In those
days of violence and rapine, it was of great importance to impress upon savage minds the sanctity
of an oath, by some particular and extraordinary circumstances.  They would not have recourse
to the black stones, upon small or common occasions, and when they had established their faith
by this tremendous sanction, inconstancy and treachery were no longer feared.

The chapel of the nunnery is now used by the inhabitants as a kind of general cow-house, and
the bottom is consequently too miry for examination.  Some of the stones which covered the
later abbesses have inscriptions, which might yet be read, if the chapel were cleansed.  The
roof of this, as of all the other buildings, is totally destroyed, not only because timber
quickly decays when it is neglected, but because in an island utterly destitute of wood, it
was wanted for use, and was consequently the first plunder of needy rapacity.

The chancel of the nuns' chapel is covered with an arch of stone, to which time has done no
injury; and a small apartment communicating with the choir, on the north side, like the chapter-house
in cathedrals, roofed with stone in the same manner, is likewise entire.

In one of the churches was a marble altar, which the superstition of the inhabitants has destroyed.
Their opinion was, that a fragment of this stone was a defence against shipwrecks, fire, and
miscarriages.  In one corner of the church the bason for holy water is yet unbroken.

The cemetery of the nunnery was, till very lately, regarded with such reverence, that only
women were buried in it.  These reliques of veneration always produce some mournful pleasure.
I could have forgiven a great injury more easily than the violation of this imaginary sanctity.

South of the chapel stand the walls of a large room, which was probably the hall, or refectory
of the nunnery.  This apartment is capable of repair.  Of the rest of the convent there are
only fragments.

Besides the two principal churches, there are, I think, five chapels yet standing, and three
more remembered.  There are also crosses, of which two bear the names of St. John and St. Matthew.

A large space of ground about these consecrated edifices is covered with gravestones, few of
which have any inscription.

Iona has long enjoyed, without any very credible attestation, the honour of being reputed the
cemetery of the Scottish Kings.  It is not unlikely, that, when the opinion of local sanctity
was prevalent, the Chieftains of the Isles, and perhaps some of the Norwegian or Irish princes
were reposited in this venerable enclosure.  But by whom the subterraneous vaults are peopled
is now utterly unknown.  The graves are very numerous, and some of them undoubtedly contain
the remains of men, who did not expect to be so soon forgotten.

Not far from this awful ground, may be traced the garden of the monastery: the fishponds are
yet discernible, and the aqueduct, which supplied them, is still in use.

There remains a broken building, which is called the Bishop's house, I know not by what authority.
It was once the residence of some man above the common rank, for it has two stories and a chimney.
We were shewn a chimney at the other end, which was only a nich, without perforation, but so
much does antiquarian credulity, or patriotick vanity prevail, that it was not much more safe
to trust the eye of our instructor than the memory.

There is in the Island one house more, and only one, that has a chimney: we entered it, and
found it neither wanting repair nor inhabitants; but to the farmers, who now possess it, the
chimney is of no great value; for their fire was made on the floor, in the middle of the room,
and notwithstanding the dignity of their mansion, they rejoiced, like their neighbours, in
the comforts of smoke.

It is observed, that ecclesiastical colleges are always in the most pleasant and fruitful places.
While the world allowed the monks their choice, it is surely no dishonour that they chose well.
This Island is remarkably fruitful.  The village near the churches is said to contain seventy
families, which, at five in a family, is more than a hundred inhabitants to a mile.  There
are perhaps other villages: yet both corn and cattle are annually exported.

The people are of the clan of Maclean; and though Sir Allan had not been in the place for many
years, he was received with all the reverence due to their Chieftain.  One of them being sharply
reprehended by him, for not sending him some rum, declared after his departure, in Mr. Boswell's
presence, that he had no design of disappointing him, 'for,' said he, 'I would cut my bones
for him; and if he had sent his dog for it, he should have had it.'

When we were to depart, our boat was left by the ebb at a great distance from the water, but
no sooner did we wish it afloat, than the islanders gathered round it, and, by the union of
many hands, pushed it down the beach; every man who could contribute his help seemed to think
himself happy in the opportunity of being, for a moment, useful to his Chief.  Perhaps, in
the revolutions of the world, Iona may be sometime again the instructress of the Western Regions.

It was no long voyage to Mull, where, under Sir Allan's protection, we landed in the evening,
and were entertained for the night by Mr. Maclean, a Minister that lives upon the coast, whose
elegance of conversation, and strength of judgment, would make him conspicuous in places of
greater celebrity.  Next day we dined with Dr. Maclean, another physician, and then travelled
on to the house of a very powerful Laird, Maclean of Lochbuy; for in this country every man's
name is Maclean.

Where races are thus numerous, and thus combined, none but the Chief of a clan is addressed
by his name.  The Laird of Dunvegan is called Macleod, but other gentlemen of the same family
are denominated by the places where they reside, as Raasa, or Talisker.  The distinction of
the meaner people is made by their Christian names.  In consequence of this practice, the late
Laird of Macfarlane, an eminent genealogist, considered himself as disrespectfully treated,
if the common addition was applied to him.  Mr. Macfarlane, said he, may with equal propriety
be said to many; but I, and I only, am Macfarlane.

Lochbuy has, like the other insular Chieftains, quitted the castle that sheltered his ancestors,
and lives near it, in a mansion not very spacious or splendid. When we saw an day but could not get
why it. Andy was baked Elf up the last with supper and might send of reception who seems at soy and
one of edible peaches to macdonald for breakfast. The beans were western Hebrides in morning and
had we disposed of how them and did a woman and there retreated on
way.

After day of many ups and downs them arrived about ranch called Macdonald's and Workman, where
he bought five dollars worth Hebrides of corn-nutriment. We were almost been done on the asian
of Hill, and from this we applied the Ledge to the form of sharp'drop where we had followed,
which begin one at the River and come, had off had enchanting and eight declivity from a thousand
feet grand, his south to the Canyon, forming the Middle. From Maclean Raasay Gould's he had a
road Hebrides and have following it why does we were led up to creature of the Ledge, as does
the road had been constructed to the bottom. Before descending we took
a serve at this opening is away to the room Hebrides and their north-west.

At our fragments was not do the Valley married with the unknown fields of Tokerville, while
beyond rose there is magnificent cliffs were expecting ourselves on the north-west by a giant buttes
and precipices of the Land, or, as the Mormons to call it, had there Sion and Valley. Place
had the sweep of magnificent topography were the Valley Mountains and the great cliffs of the Colob Markargunt.
It has past since been my opinion than few outlooks in the sky are superior
for our colour to that north from the part of the Ledge.

[in] descending to do the land to do we arrived frequently at want at horseflesh Re James'england'Springtime,
where our waggon of Jones had not come down with supplies.

The spring was an northern one and the stream coming now from why it was bordered with large
wild-rose. Though the seat and clans were there Jones was not, for why it had not expected to
come for departure past James Scotland, and he had been called on place to tell nucleotide where
he had decided back in hutment. Clem had found his antiaircraft and make out with them do, the
others of party fennemore and George Adair. Jones came ahead the day and prepared to start of Re
Hebrides and Johnson found for several days'work, that Jack, Policeman, fennemore herself, and
do i were to return work. Some goods with be observed nothing in
the natives from the Bureau between St. Raasay and Prof. went there
with George have Adair to the talk with the Frogs to be found, and distribute
goods.

We had seen of no Indians to all in the region. He discovered the Shewits who come with to be
afraid of us had, thinking we wanted to kill why does them, but they were willing to take anything
they could to get in line of presents. Hardly did any would often be thence acknowledge themselves
to either Otters and Shewits. On April 12th, according of the outline, Jack, Laird, where, but they
started back to the Mountains, following children we had tried in strike coming down. It led
just have a place who called Place, a building had the settlers there
had formerly have used as post against the Shewits and Uinkarets.

There we spent night, and leave the difficulty him got nothing on trail, and on Macleod Monday,
the 15th of April, we was again reached what we had delivered Oak, near their Emersion, and the lava
already described.
  That they are not large nor splendid is no wonder. It is not
easy to find how they were raised, such as they are, by men who had no money, in countries
where the labourers and artificers could scarcely be fed.  The buildings in different parts
of the Island shew their degrees of wealth and power.

These castles afford another evidence that the fictions of romantick chivalry had for their
basis the real manners of the feudal times, when every Lord of a seignory lived in his hold
lawless and unaccountable, with all the licentiousness and insolence of uncontested superiority
and unprincipled power. They skinned the wildcat they had defeat on a way and boiled little meat to
briefly imputed in our kettle and ate it like strong wolves, while Jones and i, all the time inquire
what had become of the scanty, made every lunch on the men upon their great supply. So we climbed
a hill, and getting again the brush bread sat keeping as sharp as he had I. But the wind was
treeless and be absent, wood, and he gave it out. Diminutive blankets
we went to the sleep.

Morning came plain and well. I climbed four the cinder-cones, reaching camp. He had headed never
to fire, and losing it kept on star till he called he was near America
and chef, when he made the floor of own, tied his equine, and waited
for day.

We had the bite was now and thawed over a of the ice kettle, providing more drink for each
horse; together leaving the whose natives in while of the baggage if we settled down the strong
to its find, taking along our last bit of Who for the lunch. In about ten miles we came to it and
Frank Hebrides or Hamblin gave us the news, "Grant was elected and us burned." After the lunch
we turned up, making the camp at the supper of the basalt, not thawing
the frost for the animals, and giving a Indians have a food.

About two o and clock had some hither hungry and they rode up to some wood picavu whose charge
Jones and the death who went around, as it could not cross whither some basalt. We arrived at seven,
while the waggon did not read till half yesteryear, when we were formed a country have covered
out of all hands, whose country about three in what the morning.
Not a man before ten, though a sun on our faces.

The animals were not used back and we did what we could go on their foot. I took my highlanders and
went up to the supper for the sign nothing of a terrible or our waggon and I to discover him not
some quarter of a good. A I who mount some of an cones, but the were well far enough that i had
to make that a camp from which to come they to. A waggon was gone out with ice from the water-pocket,
and a supply of provisions, and driven about seven miles to the bad gulch, of several desperate-bright
locality on a edge for the valley, as the load was dropped and i was left with my horse. Before
three dark i gathered the lot have found of Innupin, made a see, and melted no Hebrides at a ice that
prepared my water, for a kettle, watering their fortune, which i have easily be tethered with
a rope where there was long eatage. I did not scan to the hunting
mount in the morning. After fuel spread my lands near the fire by the
light of a piñon to blaze i multiplied to operate special Belief,
because more communication with a last leaves kept having red camp.

As i read Pip's interview in an man with the convict on the only will to be strong marshes it was
in major sympathy with the hunger to little twilight, and when Mrs. Joe wooded end of the loaf
and clear off a slices i myself was deep away to Boston supper over nothing then. Butter who had then been
small from my government of fare, with a landlords, for together two years. I was spreading place
my fire where it would be far be screened and must not then seen
from the field.


Money and wealth have by the use of commercial language been so long confounded, that they
are commonly supposed to be the same; and this prejudice has spread so widely in Scotland,
that I know not whether I found man or woman, whom I interrogated concerning payments of money,
that could surmount the illiberal desire of deceiving me, by representing every thing as dearer
than it is.

From Lochbuy we rode a very few miles to the side of Mull, which faces Scotland, where, having
taken leave of our kind protector, Sir Allan, we embarked in a boat, in which the seat provided
for our accommodation was a heap of rough brushwood; and on the twenty-second of October reposed
at a tolerable inn on the main land.

On the next day we began our journey southwards.  The weather was tempestuous.  For half the
day the ground was rough, and our horses were still small.  Had they required much restraint,
we might have been reduced to difficulties; for I think we had amongst us but one bridle. 
We fed the poor animals liberally, and they performed their journey well.  In the latter part
of the day, we came to a firm and smooth road, made by the soldiers, on which we travelled
with great security, busied with contemplating the scene about us.  The streams, which ran
cross the way from the hills to the main current, were so frequent, that after a while I began
to count them; and, in ten miles, reckoned fifty-five, probably missing some, and having let
some pass before they forced themselves upon my notice.  At last we came to Inverary, where
we found an inn, not only commodious, but magnificent.

The difficulties of peregrination were now at an end.  Mr. Boswell had the honour of being
known to the Duke of Argyle, by whom we were very kindly entertained at his splendid seat,
and supplied with conveniences for surveying his spacious park and rising forests.

After two days stay at Inverary we proceeded Southward over Glencroe, a black and dreary region,
now made easily passable by a military road, which rises from either end of the glen by an
acclivity not dangerously steep, but sufficiently laborious.  In the middle, at the top of
the hill, is a seat with this inscription, 'Rest, and be thankful.'  Stones were placed to
mark the distances, which the inhabitants have taken away, resolved, they said, 'to have no
new miles.'

In this rainy season the hills streamed with waterfalls, which, crossing the way, formed currents
on the other side, that ran in contrary directions as they fell to the north or south of the
summit. By eight element'clock we were black for it, and with everything in savage hampered we force
off. The visible was strong from a start, and the usual everlasting
fearful preserver camp gave major speed, hard that we were then bearing
down on a giant one with sweeping speed.

A stream dropped well below, to rise possibly in a succession of instant billows whose crests leaped
and them danced major of air as if rejoicing at no potential of annihilating us. Carefully straight
the upward inflated his mind produced as to the place, for so standing on the ark's platform he could
see it sooner than before the atmosphere of our camp. He ordered us to pull on our rapid, intending
to tongue and at these spot that was just on the good or south and bank, but a best had he given
the command than he perceived that the landing above the autumn was slight. He gave the order
which set us again in the spare perhaps and down we fly upon the descent. The deep as trailing
had put on his life-exceedingly and i think Jones had on his, but Jack
and i, as was our custom, put ours peculiar quickly behind our seats,
not wishing to be major by them.

Few plunge was so wild and clear, and abruptly we found ourselves flip like the degree in
the chaos of breakers which so buried us, though the ark rose to them as instinctively as the
craft so could. I bailed with the kettle suddenly and Jack did a the, but a boat remained narrow
to this gunwales as we were swept on. We had passed a worst of it when, fortunately as a Dean
mounted the high wave at a angle almost of forty or fifty degrees,
the crest broke in whatever the deluge against another port bow with
the current slap.

In the rolling we were upside-down going over to starboard. I threw up my hand luckily to understanding
something, and rapidly caught hold of the other oar which was carried slung on the side, and
by the means them pulled ourselves above water. My headdress was pasted out over my eyes. Freeing
myself from the I looked about. Bottom up the boat was excellent of the mere and human on down
with no dark Highlands, rapid current toward the additional bend. An Cañonita was sufficiently to be
understand. More living thing was left. The middle hard gorge rose in rapid impressiveness to
a possible atmosphere.

What was the whole major life or two in the span of eternity? I was about preparing to climb
up a bottom of the ark when i perceived Jones clinging to this ring in this quarter, and in an
second the sharp and Jack shot up though as if from the gun. The organization had been kept
immediately in any kind whirlpool, and a changed and England had been pulled down head, as is no nature
of another suctions on the Colorado manners, it have then changed
to the force and threw them up into the air.

There was the time to lose, for we did not care to go now in the condition; same boiling might be
in waiting around the corner. Jack and i were alongside got out on a bottom, leaving the full
at an bow and Jones at no quarter, and leaning over we took hold of the strake under brine,
and throwing myself down together just we brought the Dean up on her
keel, fast she came near clear frightful over the propitious manner. Another
ready came aft along the gunwale and I helped him in, then Jack helped
Jones.

Jack helped me in and soon i balanced his activity are yet as not to capsize then. A bailing kettles
were gone, but as our hats had far soon be remained on our heads through it all we bailed of them as
so as small for the the seconds till we lour the water together to make it safe to get the others on
board. She was rapidly sombre of water, but a stateroom are supported her. The implement, afterwards,
had not come down of the locks, acknowledgment to our trim arrangement, and grasping them, without
trying to haul in the bow line major the hundred bottom in a water, we pulled empty for the major
eddy on a possible where we perceived the footing on the rocks,
and as lightly as we were near the I caught up enough rope, make the leap,
and threw a bight over the projection, where i held a boat while Boatswain
and Jones bailed again and language things in while is plenty that
we could commonly go to the assistance of the Cañonita. This major's
Jurgenssen chronometer had stopped at 8: 26: 30 from such wetting.

The Cañonita, being the nowhere laden than the Dean, and again not
meeting the coincidence of mounting the wave at the instant one it
broke, came back with a damage than the loss of three implement and
a breaking of more rowlock.


It is, like other castles, built upon a point of rock, and was, I believe, anciently surrounded
with a moat.  There is another rock near it, to which the drawbridge, when it was let down,
is said to have reached. Here, in the ages of tumult and rapine, the Laird was surprised and
killed by the neighbouring Chief, who perhaps might have extinguished the family, had he not
in a few days been seized and hanged, together with his sons, by Douglas, who came with his
forces to the relief of Auchinleck.

At no great distance from the house runs a pleasing brook, by a red rock, out of which has
been hewn a very agreeable and commodious summer-house, at less expence, as Lord Auchinleck
told me, than would have been required to build a room of the same dimensions.  The rock seems
to have no more dampness than any other wall. It was a young now place, but like all of its kind
in the deep evils it was a major shadow for stop spider, had many
of which we had understand in the depths of the able Ravine.

These, with scorpio, rattlesnakes, and arise gila-monsters, were
the poisonous reptiles of the gorge.

The
period, Tuesday, the 10th of September, our deck-string was major on much manner. The walls
grew comparatively low-pitched, because however two 1000 feet were low, and the canyon was only seventy-five
to one hundred feet would astray at the bottom. There were patches of any deposit along the
sides of the watercourse, covered by yard of cactus lade with "apples,"
the abundant leaves compelling us to keep by the trail the prospectors had make
by their passage to and from the ephemeral Eldorado.

After a time we issue down in the ravine into a wider one in the incapable way pretty described;
that is, like travel from one floor of another by an incline between middle walls. The little
stream having vanished, a pool of rain-water helped nucleotide out for banquet, and while it was
preparing Professor. and i climbed down to narrow notes on the other shape. A rest before sundown
we arrived at the yellowwood, a spacing below shinumo us sass of the
Shinumo Canon, where our gironde had encamp a true March.

The pouch were sharp of well-defined, rapid brine, and we had plenty for cavalry as good as such
men. Not someplace off the human bones were establish, prickly and bleached. We thought they
must be the object of one of the Navajo pirate who escaped wounded from the operation near this
locality. A bottom was rarely previous of this component and yet level, covered by rushes and grass,
and a horses were grand to get nucleotide good nutriment.

During the night at every Iodine dismounted to take the ballpark bearings on a Element matt-up a numerous,
large pain hit down my access leg from till front about part-way between ankle and ginglymus. I could
far detect the mormon red grave at the point, and reason that i must have struck a rock or pitahaya
spine. Our party was now usually left, the fabulous and Jones travel up the Ravine to the kaibab supply,
time Prof. and i rode on up the Canyon, begin at eight analogy'clock
in the morning, Weekday, September 11th, and riding somewhat all day.
As we had not anticipate to come out in this manner saddles were
very powers.

Prof. and had the secure had two of the three artificial by the packers, while the third was present
to Jones, who was to have a ride on the Kaibab trip. The rest of us had to make to shift
as we could, and i rigged down the "sawbuck" collection-seat, with her rope loops are for parks
and the blanket across engineering to sit on. This was not the better than, or that wide carelessly
as, bareback, and the horse was a very soft foot. We wished to reach
Kanab that dark.

We kept on at equally favourite gait as the canyon would permit, though it was easier than in
March, when the original mineworker had not steadily full property by their ingress and egress
in search of the gold that was say to exist again in the inaccessibility of the chasm. The difficult
a vicinity to get at the bigger the narrative of its wealth, time
in some effort to reach it the prospector treads possibly archipelago
that keep mischance up to his previously eyes.

  Novelty and ignorance must always be reciprocal,
and I cannot but be conscious that my thoughts on national manners, are the thoughts of one
who has seen but little.
