PREFACE.

More generally known, perhaps, than any other Hindoo legend, is the story of the demon, RÁHU,
who brings about ECLIPSES, by devouring the Sun and Moon. For when the gods had upchurned the
nectar, the delectable Butter of the Brine, Ráhu's mouth watered at the very sight of it: and
"in the guise of a god" he mingled unperceived among them, to partake. But the Sun and Moon,
the watchful Eyes of Night and Day, detected him, and told Wishnu, who cast at him his discus,
and cut his body from his head: but not until the nectar was on the way down his throat. Hence,
though the body died, the head became immortal: and ever since, a thing unique, "no body and
all head," a byword among philosophers, he takes revenge on Sun and Moon, the great Taletellers,
by "gripping" them in his horrid jaws, and holding on, till he is tired, or can be persuaded
to let go. Hence, in some parts of India, the doleful shout of the country people at eclipses:
Chor do! chor do[1]! and hence, also, the primary and surface meaning of our title: A Digit
of the Moon in the Demon's grip: in plain English, an eclipse of the moon. And yet, legend
though it be, there is something in the old mythological way of putting the case, which describes
the situation in eclipses, far better than our arid scientific prose. I shall not easily forget,
how, as we slid like ghosts at midnight, through the middle of the desert, along the Suez Canal[2],
I watched the ghastly pallor of the wan unhappy moon, as the horrible shadow crept slowly over
her face, stealing away her beauty, and turning the lone and level sands that stretched away
below to a weird and ashy blue, as though covering the earth with a sepulchral sympathetic
pall. For we caught the "griesly terror," Ráhu, at his horrid work, towards the end of May,
four years ago.

   [1] Let go! let go!

   [2] Though nothing can be less romantic than a canal,
   gliding through that of Suez is a strange experience at
   night. Your great ship seems to move, swift and noiseless,
   through the very sand: and if only you could get there
   without knowing where you were, you would think that you
   were dreaming.

But our title has yet another meaning underneath the first, for Ahi, the name employed for
Ráhu (like all other figures in Indian mythology, he is known by many names), also means a
snake. Beauty persecuted by a snake is the subject of the story. That story will presently
explain itself: but the relation between Ráhu, or eclipses, and a snake is so curiously illustrated
by a little insignificant occurrence that happened to myself, that the reader will doubtless
forgive me for making him acquainted with it.

Being at Delhi, not many years ago, I seized the opportunity to visit the Kutub Minár. There
was famine in the land. At every station I had passed upon the way were piled the hides of
bullocks, and from the train you might see their skeletons lying, each one bleaching where
it died for want of fodder, scattered here and there on the brown and burning earth; for even
every river bed was waterless, and not a single blade of green could you descry, for many hundred
miles. And hence it came about, that as I gazed upon the two emaciated hacks that were to pull
me from the station, a dozen miles out, and as many more back, I could bring myself to sit
behind them only by the thought that thereby I should save them from a load far greater than
my own, that would have been their fate on my refusal. Therefore we started, and did ultimately
arrive, in the very blaze of noon.

The Kutub Minár is a needle of red stone, that rises from a plain as flat as paper to a height
of two hundred and fifty feet; and you might compare it, as you catch, approaching, glimpses
of it at a distance, to a colossal chimney, a Pharos, or an Efreet of the Jinn. The last would
be the best. For nothing on the surface of the earth can parallel the scene of desolation which
unrols itself below, if you climb its 380 steps and look out from the dizzy verge: a thing
that will test both the muscle of your knees and the steadiness of your nerves. Round you is
empty space: look down, the pillar bends and totters, and you seem to rock in air; you shudder,
you are falling; and away, away below, far as the eye can carry, you see the dusty plain, studded
with a thousand tombs and relics of forgotten kings. There is the grim old fortress of the
Toghlaks: there is the singular observatory of the rájá astronomer, Jaya Singh: and there the
tomb, Humaioon's tomb, before which Hodson, Hodson the brave, Hodson the slandered, Hodson
the unforgotten, sat, for two long hours, still, as if man and horse were carved in stone,
with the hostile crowd that loathed and feared him tossing and seething and surging round him,
waiting for the last Mogul to come out and be led away. The air is thick, and sparkles with
blinding dust and glare, and the wind whistles in your ears. Over the bones of dynasties, the
hot wind wails and sobs and moans. Aye! if a man seeks for melancholy, I will tell him where
to find it--at the top of the old Kutub Minár.

And then, that happened which I had foreseen. We had not gone a mile upon our homeward way,
when one of the horses fell. Therefore, disregarding the asseverations of my rascally Jehu
that the remaining animal was fully equal to the task alone, I descended, and proceeded on
foot. But a ten mile walk on the Delhi plain in the hottest part of the day is not a thing
to be recommended. After plodding on for about two hours, I was, like Langland, "wery forwandred,"
and went me to rest, not alas! by a burnside, but in the shadow of one of the innumerable little
tombs that stand along the dusty road. There I lay down and fell asleep.

Nothing induces slumber like exertion under an Indian sun. When I awoke, that sun was setting.
A little way before me, the yellow walls of Delhi were bathed in a ruddy glow; the minarets
of the Great Mosque stood out sharp against the clear unspotted amber sky. And as I watched
them, I suddenly became aware that I was myself observed with interest by a dusky individual,
who was squatted just in front of me, and who rose, salaaming, when he saw that I was awake.
It appeared that I had, so to say, fallen into a "nest of vipers;" that I had unwittingly invaded
the premises of a snake dealer, who, no doubt for solid reasons, had made my friendly tomb
the temporary repository of his stock-in-trade.

The Indian snake charmer, gáruda, hawadiga[3], or whatever else they call him, is as a rule
but a poor impostor. He goes about with one fangless cobra, one rock snake, and one miserable
mongoose, strangling at the end of a string. My dweller in tombs was richer than all his tribe
in his snakes, and in his eyes. I have never seen anybody else with real cat's eyes: eyes with
exactly that greenish yellow luminous glare which you see when you look at a cat in the dark.
They gleamed and rolled in the evening sun, over a row of shining teeth, as their owner squatted
down before me, liberating one after another from little bags and baskets an amazing multitude
of snakes, which he fetched in batches from the interior of the tomb, till the very ground
seemed alive with them[4]. Some of them he handled only with the greatest respect, and by means
of an iron prong. Outside the Zoo (where they lose in effect) I never saw so many together
before: and it is only when you see a number of these reptiles together that you realise what
a strange uncanny being, after all, is a snake: and as you watch him, lying, as it were, in
wait, beautiful exceedingly, but with a beauty that inspires you with a shudder, his eyes full
of cruelty and original sin, and his tongue of culumny and malice, you begin to understand
his influence in all religions. I was wholly absorbed in their snaky evolutions, and buried
in mythological reminiscences, when my gáruda roused me suddenly, by saying: Huzoor, look!

   [3] Háwa, in Canarese, is the name of Ráhu.

   [4] I did not count them, but there were several dozen,
   nearly all different. I have reason to believe that this
   man must have been one of the disciples of a former very
   celebrated snake charmer, who was known all over India.

He leaned over, and administered with his bare hand a vicious dig to a magnificent hamadryad,
that lay coiled upon itself in its open basket. The creature instantly sat up, with a surge
of splendid passion, hissing, bowing, and expanding angrily its great tawny hood. The gáruda
put his púngi to his lips, and blew for a while upon it a low and wheezy drone,--the invariable
prelude to a little jadoo, or black art,--which the beautiful animal appeared to appreciate:
and then, pointing with the end of his pipe to the "spectacles" on its hood, he said, with
that silky, insinuating smile which is characteristic of the scamp: Huzoor, dekho, namas karta[5]:--

    Nágki phani, chánd ka dúkh
    Uski badi, áp ka súkh[6].

   [5] See, he makes obeisance.

   [6] Which we may roughly render: Hood of snake brings joy
   and rue, this to moon and that to you. In all Oriental
   saws, jingle counts for much.

I did not understand his lunar allusion, but, judging that his rhyming gibberish, like that
of the rascally priests in Apuleius, was a carefully prepared oracle of general application,
kept in stock for the cozening of such prey as myself, I repeated to him my favourite Hindu
proverb[7], and gave him, in exchange for his benevolent cheque on the future, a more commonplace
article of present value, which led to our parting on the most amicable terms. But I did him
injustice, perhaps. Long afterwards, having occasion to consult an astronomical chart, with
reference to this very story, all at once I started, and in an instant, the golden evening,
the walls of Delhi, and my friend of the many snakes and sinister eyes, suddenly rose up again
into my mind. For there, staring at me out of the chart, was the mark on the cobra's head.
It is the sign still used in modern astronomy for "the head and tail of the dragon," the nodes
indicating the point of occultation, the symbol of eclipse.

   [7] "Tulsi, in this world hobnob with everybody: for you
   never know in what guise the deity may present himself."
   In the original it is a rhyming stanza.

What then induced or inspired the gáruda to connect me with the moon? Was it really black art,
divination, or was it only a coincidence? Reason recommends the latter alternative: and yet,
the contrary persuasion is not without its charm. Who knows? It may be, that the soul grows
to its atmosphere as well as the body, and living in a land where dreams are realities, and
all things are credible, and history is only a fairy tale: the land of the moon and the lotus
and the snake, old gods and old ruins, former births, second sight, and idealism: it falls
back, unconsciously mesmerised, under the spell of forgotten creeds.

   May that triumphant Lord protect us, who as he stands in
   mysterious meditation, bathed in twilight, motionless, and
   ashy pale[1], with the crystal moon in his yellow hair,
   appears to the host of worshippers on his left, a woman,
   and to those on his right, a man.

   [1] Being actually smeared with ashes. The god is of course
   Shiwa, and the allusion is to his Ardhanári, or half
   male, half female form.

There lived of old, on the edge of the desert, a rájá of the race of the sun. And like that
sun reflected at midday in the glassy depths of the Mánasa lake, he had an image of himself
in the form of a son[2], who exactly resembled him in every particular, except age. And he
gave him the name of Aja, for he said: He is not another, but my very self that has conquered
death, and passed without birth straight over into another body. Moreover, he will resemble
his ancestor, and the god after whom I have called him Aja[3]. So as this son grew up, his
father's delight in him grew greater also. For he was tall as a shála tree, and very strong,
and yet like another God of Love: for his face was more beautiful than the face of any woman,
with large eyes like lapis-lazuli, and lips like laughter incarnate: so that his father, as
often as he looked at him, said to himself: Surely the Creator has made a mistake, and mixed
up his male and female ingredients, and made him half and half. For if only he had had a twin
sister, it would have been difficult to tell with certainty, which was which.

   [2] This punning assonance is precisely in the vein of the
   original.

   [3] This name (pronounce Aj- to rhyme with trudge)
   meaning both unborn and a goat, is a name of the sun
   (who was a goat in Assyria), the soul, Brahma, Wishnu,
   Shiwa, the God of Love, and others. It was also the name of
   Rama's grandfather.

And then, when Aja was eighteen, his father died. And immediately, his relations conspired
against him, led by his maternal uncle. And they laid a plot, and seized him at night, and
bound him when he was asleep: for they dared not attack him when he was awake, for fear of
his courage and his prodigious strength. And they deliberated over him, as he lay bound, what
they should do with him: and some of them were for putting him to death, then and there. But
the prime minister, who was in the plot, persuaded them to let him live: saying to himself:
In this way I shall make for myself a loophole of escape, in case he should ever regain his throne.

Then in the early morning, his uncle and his other relations took him away, and laid him bound
on a swift camel. And mounting others, they hurried him away into the desert, going at full
speed for hours, till they reached its very heart. And there they set him down. And they placed
beside him a little water in a small skin, and a little bag of corn. And his uncle said: Now,
O nephew, we will leave thee, alone with thy shadow and thy life in the sand. And if thou canst
save thyself, by going away to the western quarter, lo! it is open before thee. But beware
of attempting to return home, towards the rising sun. For I will set guards to watch thy coming,
and I will not spare thee a second time.

And then, he set his left arm free, and laid beside him a little knife. And they mounted their
camels, and taking his, they flew away from him over the sand, like the shadow of a cloud driven
by the western wind.

So when they were gone, Aja took the knife, and cut his bonds. And he stood up, and watched
them going, till they became specks on the edge of the desert, and vanished out of his sight.

II.

Then he looked round to the eight quarters of the world, and he looked up into the sky. And
he said to himself: There is my ancestor, alone above, and I am alone, below. And he put his
two hands to his breast, and flung them out into the air. And he exclaimed: Bho! ye guardians
of the world[4], ye are my witnesses. Thus do I fling away the past, and now the whole wide
world is mine, and ye are my protectors. And I have escaped death by a miracle, and the craft
of that old villain of a prime minister, whom I will one day punish as he deserves. And now
it is as though I knew, for the very first time in all my life, what it was to be alive. Ha!
I live and breathe, and there before me is food and water. And now we will see, which is the
stronger: Death in the form of this lonely desert, or the life that laughs at his menace as
it dances in my veins. And little I care for the loss of my kingdom, now that my father is
dead and gone. I throw it away like a blade of grass, and so far from lamenting, I feel rather
as if I had been born again. Ha! it is good to be alive, even in this waste of sand. And he
shouted aloud, and called out to the sun above him: Come, old Grandfather, thou and I will
travel together across the sand. And yet, no. Thou art too rapid and too fierce to be a safe
companion, even for one of thy own race. So thou shalt go before me, as is due to thee, and
I will follow after.

   [4] The Lokapálas, or regents of the world, often thus
   appealed to, are eight: Kubera, Isha, Indra, Agni, Yama,
   Niruti, Waruna, and Wayu: and they ride on a horse, a bull,
   an elephant, a ram, a buffalo, a man, a "crocodile," and a
   stag.

And then, he lay down on the sand, covering his head with his upper garment, and slept and
waited all day long, till the sun was going down. And then he rose, and eat and drank a very
little, and taking with him his skin and corn, he walked on after the sun, which sank to his
rest in the western mountain. But Aja followed him all night long, with the moon for his only
companion. And as he went, he saw the bones of men and camels, lying along the sand, and grinning
at him as it were with white and silent laughter, as though to say: Anticipate thy fate: for
but a little further on, and thou shalt be what we are now. But he went on with nimble feet,
like one that hurries through the den of a sleeping hungry lion, till the sun rose at last
behind him. And then again he lay down, and rested all day long, and started again at night.
And so he proceeded for many days, till all his water and corn was gone. And as he threw away
the skin, he set his teeth, and said: No matter. I will reach the end of this hideous sand,
which like the dress of Draupadi[5], seems to roll itself out as I go across it, though I should
have to go walking on long after I am dead.

   [5] When she was lost in the gambling match, and Duhshásana
   tried to strip her, still as he pulled off one dress,
   another appeared below it, refusing to leave her naked.

And night after night he went on, growing every night a little weaker. And then at last there
came a night when as he toiled along with heavy steps that flagged as it were with loaded feet,
faint with hunger and burning thirst, he said to himself: I am nearly spent, and now the end
is coming near, either of the sand, or me. And then the sun rose behind him, and he looked
up, and lo! it was reflected from the wall of a city before him, which resembled another sun
of hope rising in the west to cheer him. And he rubbed his eyes, and looked again, saying to
himself: Is it a delusion of the desert, to mock me as I perish, or is it really a true city?
And he said again: Ha! it is a real city. And his ebbing strength came back to him with a flood
of joy. And he stooped, and took up a little sand, and turned, and threw it back, exclaiming:
Out upon thee, abode of death![6] Now, then, I have beaten thee, and thy victim will after
all escape. And he hurried on towards the city, half afraid to take his eyes away from it for
a single instant, lest it should disappear.

   [6] Still the name of Marwar.

So as he drew near it, he saw a crowd upon its wall. And when he was distant from it but a
little way, suddenly its great gate's mouth was thrown open, and a stream of people shot from
it like a long tongue, and rapidly came towards him, so that he said to himself: Ha! then,
as it seems, I am expected by the citizens of this delightful city, who are as eager to come
to me as I am to get to them. And they came closer, clamouring and buzzing as it were like
bees; and he looked and lo! they were all women, and there was not a man among them all. And
as he wondered, they ran up, and reached him, and threw themselves upon him like a wave of
the sea, laughing and crying, and drowning him in their embraces: and they took him as it were
captive, and swept him away towards the city, all talking at once, and deafening him with their
joyful exclamations, paying not the least attention to anything that he tried to say. And Aja
let himself go, carried away by all those women like a leaf in a rushing stream. And he said
to himself, in astonishment: What is this great wonder? For all these women fight for me, as
if they had never seen a man in their lives before. Where then can the men be, to whom they
must belong? Or can it be, that I have come to a city composed of women without a man? Have
I escaped the desert, only to be drowned in a sea of women? For what is the use of a single
man, in an ocean of the other sex? Or are they dragging me away to offer me up to the Mother[7],
having sacrificed all their own husbands already? Or have I really died in the desert, and
is all this only a dream of the other world? Can these be the heavenly Apsarases, come in a
body to fetch me away, as if I had fallen in battle? Surely they are, for some of them are
sufficiently beautiful even for Indra's hall. And anyhow, it is better to be torn to pieces
by beautiful women, even if there are far too many, than to die in the desert, all alone.

   [7] Durgá or Párwatí.

So as they bore him along, chattering on like jays and cranes, he said again to the women next
him: Fair ones, who are you, and where are you taking me, and why in the world are you so greatly
delighted to see me? And then at last, they replied: O handsome stranger, ask nothing: very
soon thou shalt know all, for we are carrying thee away to our King. And Aja said to himself:
Ha! So, then, there is a King. These women have, after all, a King. Truly, I am fain to see
him, this singular King of a female city. And weak as he was, he began to laugh, as they all
were laughing: and so they all surged on like a very sea of laughter, through the gates of
the city, and along the streets within, till they came at last to the King's palace. And all
the way, Aja looked, and there was not to be seen so much as the shadow of a man in all the
streets, which overflowed with women like the channel of a river in the rainy season.

Then the guards of the palace doors, who were also women, took him, and led him in; and all
the women who had brought him crowded in behind. And they mounted stairs, and after a while,
they entered at last a great hall, whose pillars of alabaster were reflected in its dark green
crystal floor, giving it the semblance of a silent pool in which a multitude of colossal swans
had buried their necks beneath the water. And there Aja found himself in the presence of the King.

And instantly, all the women screamed together: Victory to thee, Maharájá! for here have we
brought thee another husband for thy lovely daughter. And Aja started. And he said to himself:
Another husband! How many husbands, then, has this strange King's daughter got already? Has
she an insatiable thirst for husbands, whose number I am brought to swell? So as he stood reflecting,
the King leaped from his throne, and came towards him. And as Aja looked at him, he was seized
with amazement greater than before. For the King resembled a very incarnation of the essence
of grief, yet such, that it was difficult to behold him without laughter, as if the Creator
had made him to exhibit skill in combining the two. For his long thin hair was pure white,
as if with sorrow, and his eyes were red, as if with weeping, and great hollow ruts were furrowed
in his sunk and withered cheeks, as if the tears had worn themselves channels in which to run.
And though he was tall, he was bent and old, as if bowed down by a load of care. And he tried,
as if in vain, to smile, as he said in a mournful voice that quavered and cracked: O man, whoever
thou art, long have I waited for thee, and glad indeed I am to see thee, and inclined to dance
like a peacock at the sight of a rainy cloud.

And as he gazed upon the King, Aja was seized with sudden laughter that would not be controlled:
saying within himself: Much in common they have between them, a dancing happy peacock, and
this doleful specimen of a weeping King! And he laughed, till tears ran down his cheeks also,
as if in imitation of those of the King. And when at last he could speak, he said: O King,
forgive me. For I am very weak, and have come within a little of dying in the desert. And I
laughed from sheer exhaustion, and for joy to see in thy person as it were the warrant of my
escape from death. Give me food, and above all, water, if thou wouldst not have me die at thy
feet. And afterwards, show me, if thou wilt, thy daughter, to whom, as it seems, I am to be
married, whether I will or no. And the King said: O thou model of the Creator's cunning in
the making of man, thy hilarity is excused. Food thou shalt have, and water, and everything
else thou canst require, and that immediately. But as for my daughter, there she is before
thee. And she could teach dancing even to Tumburu himself[8].

   [8] A Ghandarwa, or heavenly musician, and the dancing
   master of the Apsarases. [Pronounce tum- to rhyme with
   room, rather short.]

III.

And then, as the laughter surged again in Aja's soul, saying within himself: Out on this pitiable
old scarecrow of a King, whose only thought is dancing! the King turned, and stood aside. And
Aja looked, and instantly, the laughter died out of his heart, which ceased as it were to beat.
And he murmured to himself: Ha! this is the most wonderful thing of all. King and women and
desert and all vanished out of his mind, as if the sentiment that suddenly seized it filled
it so completely as to leave room for nothing else. And he stood still gazing, feeling as though
he were spinning round, though he was standing still as death. For there before him stood this
enigmatical King's daughter. And like her father, she also seemed an incarnation of the soul
of grief, not as in his case ignominious, and an object of derision, but rather resembling
a heavenly drug, compounded of the camphor of the cold and midnight moon, that had put on a
fragrant form of feminine and fairy beauty to drive the world to sheer distraction, half with
love and half with woe. For like the silvery vision of the newborn streak of that Lord of Herbs,
she was slender and pale and wan, formed as it seemed of some new strange essence of pure clear
ice and new dropt snow, and she loomed on the soul of Aja out of the blackness of his trance
like a large white drooping lily, just seen in the gloom of an inky night. And her hair and
brow were the colour of a thunder-cloud in the month of Chaitra[9], and like that cloud, the
heavy sorrow hung in her great dark mournful eyes, drenching him as it were with a shower of
dusky dreamy dewy beauty, and drawing him down bewitched and lost like the victim of a haunted
pool into the snaky eddy of their silent unfathomable recess. And yet her deep red lips trembled,
as it were on the very border of a smile, as if they were hinting against their will of a mine
of laughter and subtle snares that they were not allowed to use. And she had risen up to come
and meet him, yet was hanging back as if reluctant, and so she stood, all reflected in the
polished floor, with her head thrown back to look at him, for she was very small, like one
on the very point of imploring help, yet shrinking, as if too proud to ask it from a stranger,
balanced as it were between reliance on her own pure and pleading beauty and doubtfulness of
its reception. So she halted irresolute, with glorious throat that was hovering still over
the swell of her lifted breasts, poised as it were on the very verge of tumultuous oscillation,
like that of Rati, preparing with timidity to cast herself at the feet of the three-eyed God,
to beg back the body of her burned-up husband in a passion of love-lorn tears.

   [9] April.

And Aja stood before her, like the sea when the digit of the moon rises suddenly over its waves,
stirred with a tumult of strange emotions, and yet lit by a heavenly ray, a mass of agitated
darkness mixed with dancing, trembling light; all unaware that he was himself to the King's
daughter exactly what she was to him, a weapon of bewilderment in the hands of the cunning
god of the flowery bow, who shot him suddenly at her, like an arrow of intoxication, and pierced
her through the very middle of the soft lotus of her heart.

So they two stood awhile in silence. And all at once, Aja spoke, not knowing that he spoke
aloud. And he said, very slowly: How many husbands, then, have already had this lustrous beauty,
who looks for all as pure and pale and undefiled as a new young delicate jasmine bud? And instantly,
as if roused from sleep by his reproach, he saw the colour leap up into her cheek, and spread
like dawn flushing over her burning throat and brow. And she drew a sudden breath, and her
bosom heaved abruptly as if with a sob of shame. And at that moment, the voice of the King
her father broke harshly into Aja's dream, saying: Alas! alas! Never a husband has had her
yet, though she is now long past sixteen, and could even teach Tumburu dancing.

And then, as if the King's words had suddenly lifted a weight from his soul, Aja burst into
a shout of laughter. And he tottered, as if to fall. And he caught at the old King's arm, and
gripped it so that he almost screamed, exclaiming amid his laughter: Ha! King, I am also the
son of a King: and now I will be thy son-in law. And she shall have a husband at last, and
teach him, if she pleases, dances, that even Tumburu does not know. And with that, he fell
into such a paroxysm of laughter, that weak as he was, he could not stand, but fell: and his
laughter turned to sobbing. Then the King's daughter turned to her father, with an angry flush
on her brow. And she said, with strong emotion: O father, wilt thou delay for ever to send
for food and water? Dost thou not see that this King's son, great and powerful though he be,
is weak, and it may be, perishing, before thy face, of hunger and thirst, having escaped by
a miracle out of the desert to die by thy neglect.

And she clapped her hands, stamping her foot in indignation. Then the women ran, and took up
Aja, and carried him away. And they bathed him, and tended him, and fed him till he was recovered:
and after a while, they brought him back, into the presence of the King.

IV.

So he came once more into that hall, looking like another man. And he seemed in the eyes of
the King like the rising sun of his daughter's marriage, but in those of his daughter like
the very God of Love, newly risen from his own ashes. And he said joyously: O King, now I am
again myself: and my reason and my strength have both again returned to me. And if in their
absence, I behaved strangely and without good manners, it behoves thee to lay the blame rather
on the desert of sand, that surrounds thy city, than on myself. For I was like one delirious,
and half distracted, by wonder and other feelings coming to the aid of hunger and thirst. Then
he told the King his name and family, and all his story, looking all the while at the King's
daughter, as she did all the while at him, with glances that resembled sighs. But as he watched
her, Aja said to himself in wonder: What has happened to her, since I saw her first, and what
is the matter with her, now? For her quiet grief has abandoned her, and she looks like one
in a burning fever; and two red spots, like suns, burn and blaze upon her cheeks, and her great
eyes shine and glow, as if there was a fire within her soul. So when he had finished his own
tale, he said: Now, then, O King, I have told thee all that I have to tell. And now it is thy
turn to speak. Explain to me all this wonder; for I seem to move in a maze of extraordinary
events. Why are there, in thy city, no men, but only women? And what is the cause of thy grief?
And, greatest wonder of all, how comes it that thou hast found a difficulty in finding a husband
for this thy daughter? For, as for myself, know, that, make any terms thou wilt, I am ready
to marry her, blindfold, on any conditions whatever: nay, would she only be my wife, I should
consider the fruit of my birth attained.

And then, to his amazement, that strange old King began to weep once more. And tears flowed
down his cheeks like rain, as he said: Alas! alas! O son-in-law that would be, so fine a man
art thou, that I am distressed indeed to see thee, and to hear thee so eagerly proposing to
take my daughter for thy wife. For all that have preceded thee, and they were many hundreds,
have said the very same: and yet all without exception have come to a miserable end: and there
she is, unmarried still[10]. And yet this is no fault of hers, unless indeed it be a fault
to be beautiful beyond compare. Nor has her maiden purity been sullied in the least degree
by ever a suitor of them all. But all this has come about by reason of a fault of mine, itself,
beyond a doubt, the bitter fruit of the tree of crimes committed in a former birth. For know,
that long ago, when I was young, I conquered the entire earth, and brought it all, from sea
to sea, under the shadow of one umbrella. So when I was reposing, after my exertions, one day
there came to see me Nárada and another rishi. And Nárada entered first. And when he complimented
me, as the chosen husband of the earth, I said to myself: Now, I must make him some suitable
return. And accordingly, I presented him with the whole earth. Then he replied: O King, what
is the use of the earth to me? And he gave it back to me, with his blessing, saying: Obtain
an incomparably beautiful offspring[11]! and so he went away. And then the other great rishi
entered, and congratulated me also. And I presented him also with the entire earth. Then that
rishi looked at me with eyes that were red with anger. And he said slowly: What! Is my merit
utterly despised? Dost thou presume to offer me only the leavings of another? Thou shalt indeed
obtain offspring, but only of the female sex. And beautiful it shall be indeed: but little
shall that beauty profit either thyself or her. So having uttered his curse[12], he laughed,
and instantly went away, refusing to be propitiated or to throw any light upon the future.
And thereafter in due time there was born to me, not the nectar of a son, but this lump of
grief in the form of a daughter. And as if her sex were not enough[13], her almost inconceivable
beauty and accomplishments have only added to my calamity: nay, they are the very root of it,
and the essence of its sting. For all has come to pass, exactly as that testy old rishi said.
For though she is, as thou seest, beautiful as the moon, and like it, full of arts[14], and
above all, a dancer that would turn even Tumburu green with envy, all this nectar has become
poison by the curse of that old ascetic, and the very perfection of her beauty has become the
means of undoing us both. For about two years ago, as we were walking together at midnight,
on the terrace of the palace, that forms the edge of the city wall, enjoying the cold camphor
of the moon after the heat of a burning day, suddenly, out of the desert, we heard as it were
the rush of wings. And as we stood and listened, there arose in the air a sound of voices,
like those of a man and woman in vehement dispute. But though we could distinguish the tones,
we could not understand the meaning, for the language was unknown to us. And then, after a
while, those two invisible air-goers appeared all at once before our eyes, seated on the battlements,
in the form of a pair of vultures[15]. And immediately, the male vulture spoke with a human
voice, saying: O King, give me now this daughter of thine to wife. And instantly I answered
rashly: Never will I bestow my daughter on a bird of ill-omen such as thou art. Thereupon that
evil-minded suitor laughed like a hyaena: and instantly my daughter fell into a swoon. And
as she lay in the moonlight, she looked so indescribably and unutterably beautiful, that even
that loathsome bird was moved. And he said to his companion: Daughter, I was right, and thou
wert wrong. Look, and see, and allow, that she is far more beautiful than even thou art. Thereupon
that gridhri[16] laughed also, and she said: Time shall show. Listen, King. This is Kírttisena,
a nephew of Wásuki, King of the Snakes, and I am his only daughter. For this form of vulture
was assumed by us, only to converse with thee. Now he maintained thy daughter to be more beautiful
than I am. Thereupon I vowed vengeance. But I agreed to leave her unmolested, if thou didst
give her to him for a wife. So to preserve her from my vengeance, he asked her of thee in marriage. The
compilation of authorotative narritives, though varied and non-specific are collaboratively indisputable.
Real news in revolutionary times when the majority of land was free from human interaction
was rare. Records were not meticulously or regularly kept. soldiers lacked the free time to keep
a record of their personal accounts and were more concerned with survival than nostalgia.
 This shall be the condition of thy daughter's marriage.
Whatever suitor shall lay claim to her, thou shalt send up to this terrace alone at flight.
And if he claims, and does not come, we will swallow thy city whole, houses and all. Then those
two vultures disappeared. And not long afterwards, hearing that my daughter was to be given
in marriage, suitors arrived like swarms of bees from every quarter of the world, attracted
by her fame. For she is called Yashowatí, because the fame of her fills the world. Florence soon
discovered that the same stomach troubles that confined him to a limited diet of bland food and
bubbly beverages was the same as Mr. Crane. Their health was a steady source of sympathy for their
gaseous expulsions. And when all the distant suitors were exhausted,
and all the neighbouring kings, then, in my ardent desire to get her married, no matter how,
to no matter whom, I offered her to the men of my own city, showing her to them from the palace
windows. An inner recess, which is usually in the twenty-five to thirty-three inch wide range, is
sometimes present. There is most often a religious scene over the recess. The general conclusion
is that it seems that these religious scenes were the heart of family worship for the household.

The
custom of wearing or having devotional items or objects was very commonplace. We know this
from the plentiful finds of small statuary of various gods that are found. Many are made from
glazed pottery, but exemplars made of bronze. silver, and gold and found not infrequently.
Children most often wore figures of Bes, but there have been finds of figures of Taurt, the
spirit of protection for children.

The harvest festival and its traditions are another intesting facet of the religious framework
of the times. One of these practices was the heaping of grain with
the implements of its harvest stuck in it vertically.

   Then the celebrants raised the boards with which they
   would scoop up the grain aloft, one to a hand, and praised
   and paid homage to Rannut. Rannut was the god of the havest
   who had a serpentine form.
   

   We know from a fragment of an extant calendar that has been
   recovered that the people acknowledged and believed
   in unlucky and lucky days. The calendar marks each day as
   good or evil and some day as triply so.

   
   In prehistoric times, it seems that great stones with figures
   of coiled serpents were the norm for household amulets.
   Much of the data from with these serpent stones suggest an
   earlier use of large ammonites than has been previously thought.

   Horus and the depiction of his role as the subduer of the
   evil powers seems to have been the standard image for protective
   household amulets in later periods.
   
   In the Roman era, due to more plentiful finds, we have a
   much better and more complete idea of the view of poupular worship.

   The terra-cotta figurines of the era serve to illustrate this.

   We find five figures of Serapis, five figures of Isis,
   four figures of Bes, one figure of the goddess of the palm trees,
but twenty-four figures of Horus from a single location at Ehnasya.

   We can clearly see that the worship of Horus that was dominant
   during this period, having grown in position from previous times.

The terra-cottas also serve to show us the type of shrines that were in household use as well as wayside
or travel shrines. These were a type of wooden framed cupboard crowned with a cornice of urÃ¦i.
They had doors on the bottom of the cupboard with a recess just over
the doors.

There were two pillars on the cupboard as well, one to either side of the recess. The recess
itself was used to hold an image with a burning lamp that placed just in front of the image.
Also in use, were some smaller lamp holders, which were made to hang up near the shrines. There
is some speculation that these were also used, perhaps with an accompanying
lamp, on a grave or burial tomb. Egypt currently uses mud hutches,
which are made solely for a location to place lamps in on holy sites,
to similar purpose and effect as the wood framed cupboards of the
past. Rose Hartwick Thorpe was born in Kansas in the early 60s and lived in Wilmington.
She is the author of "Curfew Shall Not Ring To-Night."
Miss Margaret Stevenson is an author of books for blind people, and resides in Olathe. Her short
stories, nature books, and textbooks have also been published.
Lelia Hardin Bugg, of Wichita, wrote "The People of Our Parish," "Orchids," and "The Prodigal
Daughter."

Edna Thacher Russ is also from Wichita and specializes in writing short stories and articles.

Mrs. E. Hamilton Myers lives in Englewood and is a talented writer and poet. She enjoys music, and
her poetry often provides the lyrics for her songs.
Mrs. Myers's very first story was published in a magazine which had previously published her
mother's work. She writes for the English papers.

   In non-literature writing fields, we also have Mrs. Lillian M. Mitchner
of Topeka, who specializes in science writing, and Mrs. Lumina C.
R. Smythe, who co-wrote "Flora and Check List of Kansas" with her
late husband.

She also resides in Topeka.

There are many talented newspaper writers in Kansas as well.

These include Margie Webb Tennal of Sabetha; Frances Garside, who started in Atchison and
is now with the New York Journal; Maud C. Thomspon of Howard; Anna Carlson of Lindsborg; Mrs.
E. E. Kelley of Toronto; Mrs. Mary Riley of Kansas City; and Isabel Worrel Ball, who received
the honor of being the only woman to sit in the congressional press gallery.
In Girard, Grace D. Brewer is a magazine and newspaper writer who
has been writing for a decade.

Early writers in Kansas include Mrs. A. B. Bartlett, Mrs. Porter Sherman, Mrs. C. H. Cushing,
Lucy B. Armstrong, Clarinda Howard Nichols, Mary Tenny Gray, and Sarah Richart.
Sara T. D. Robinson was the wife of Kansas's first governor, and wrote "Kansas, Interior and
Exterior." This book was first published in 1856 and enjoyed its
tenth edition in 1889. The chapel has its site among the college buildings.
There the students assemble every morning for the reading of the spiritual scriptures and for
prayer; and onto the Sabbath religious facilities are behaved as soon as the customary method of
the churches. Studies within natural theology and within the catechism also form a portion
of the college course. The religious atmosphere which surrounds the college is as genial and
happy as the natural atmosphere which washes the hills and valleys round within October days.
It has none component of sectarianism or bigotry. Free alike from cant, from looseness and
indifference, the religious tone of the college is altogether wholesome.
Williams, the westernmost of our New England colleges, blends within harmonious mixture the
puritan mettle of the East with the progressive mettle of the West, and bids towards everybody
whom arrive towards her doors an education based upon endeavoured beliefs, and behaved within
a healthful spirit. At his inauguration towards the office of its presidency, Dr. Hopkins remarked,
"I yearn and shall labor that this may be a safe college; that here may be health, and happy
learn, and kind feelings, and pure morals."

No vocabulary possibly could better recount the spirit which, below his sensible management,
and that of his acquaintances, the college has maintained.
President Carter's inaugural address consisted an urgent plea for a professorship of the "History
and Polity of the Hebrew Theocracy," and although the funds for such a professorship are still
longing, the college stands faithfully via the old traditions of reverence and worship and tone
morality. omebody or other asked of my writing"GLUCK"instead of"GLICK,"He didn't like the 2

how completely some of our writers have failed in trying to deal with contemporary events,

AIR-RAID MODE IN MANCHESTER.. Zangheema attends the marts of Mourzuk and Kanou. He is his right hand man, his
man of buisness, his vizier, and his shadow. He is pretty much his second half. Fortunately
for us, he is now going to Kanou.

While we were busy drying our clothes after the previous day's quests, we learned that another
Sultan had put himself on the list of panhandlers.

The King Astakeelee of Asoudee, has written a long letter of which
we are the subject, to En-Noor.

    It's about a sin to dispoil us Christians.
      En-Noor says we must send him some trifle
    as a present. Lousou and some others still
                             have yet to arrive.

I am glad we're not expected to give much in these cases.

Simply because of the fact that we don't have the means to do so. I sent Astakeelee a red
cloth caftan, long loose gown, a white turban, a fez, a small looking-glass, and a few cloves
for the Sultana. All of those items totaled to about twelve dollars.

From the northern frontier, we just received some serious news. It looks like the Azgher who
followed us all the way from Aisou to Aheer, has secretly rallied up people against us. They
have joined with the Kailouee borderers. They plan for an attack upon a small Tibboo caravan. Already
two of the merchants have been killed. Thirty-five slaves have been
stolen and carried away over the desert, in the direction of Tuat.

A
caravan of Fezzanees brought in the news this afternoon. The caravan
arrived from GhÃ¢t. They buried the bodies of the two murdered men,
so they declare. The rest of the new came from a servant who escaped. Deccan Miss
Frere's stories make us well acquainted with one of these characters, an evil magician named
Punchkin, whose name serves as a convenient name for those monsters long life. The present
collection contains several examples. In "Brave HÃ­rÃ¡lÃ¡lbÃ¡sÃ¡" (no. 11) we meet with a Rakshas,
which is induced, as usual, by female wiles to discover the secret
of his life.

   When the bird is comprised of a hero of the story, Rakshas
   believes that something terrible happened.

When poultry legs and wings are removed, Rakshas becomes a simple head and torso, and neck
when the bird is squeezed, falls down dead Rakshas. Similarly, the story of "Demon" and "Son
King" (no. 24), demon prince killed died when a particular bird and bird life as conterminable
demon. According DunknÃ­ narrator, "all souls Rakshases keep their birds, but another authority
states (p. 261) that" a whole tribe Rakshases, living in Ceylon, they kept in a single lemon.
"
The story of "The Frog voracious" (no. 6) is a valuable contribution to the store I already have
what appear to be myths about the apparent destruction, but the final resuscitation. For this
class seem to belong to the Little Red Riding Hood stories were probably based on, describing
how a wolf or other monster swallows various beings innocent, but was eventually forced to restore
them uninjured in daylight. In its original story may have been a nature myth, illustrating the
apparent annihilation to the darkness of night or winter cold, and rebirth that comes back
or spring days, or perhaps a moral apologue intended to suggest that death can not be an annihilation
of time. In its modern form, either east or west, often assumes a grotesque air. A good illustration
is provided by well-known story of the north "How greedy," in which "The Frog voracious"
 The Mantis is a type of cricket; and is part of the second order of insects,

good address. His forehead bears the seal of the fatigues of war. He is a falconer, and vowed
to fly his hawks on Friday for my amusement and to spend the day in Abbotsford. The young Duke
of B. was on the ground looking at the corps, many of which are his tenants. They are very
good and nice, smart young people, and well mounted. Too few of them though, which is sad. The exercise

Get my assignment during the night.
Oct. 5 .-- I thought this morning that my time glided away in a single monotonous way, as one of those
days that are dark gray or promise sun or rain threaten, too melancholy to enjoy, too quiet for repining.
But this day brought changes in some way shakes my philosophy. I found a letter from J. Gibson
to go to London without danger, and if I may, I have a way to examine the papers in the Secretary
of State at the Office of Bonn. when St. Helena.

   The opportunity having been offered must be accepted, and
   yet I had a lot and stay home. Even the possibility of seeing
   Sofia and Lockhart to be confused with pain, but this is too
   stupid. Lady Hamilton [350] I wrote that Pozzo Di
   Borgo, [351] of the Russian minister in Paris, is ready to communicate
to me some details about Bonaparte's early life. Search - could not
get there? In one penny in the pound. 

   My sole answer to the work written anonymously by the author
   known as M. Laplace, who knew all about geometry but nothing
   about France and therefore gave Bailly the bad advice, will
   be these small details.

   
   It's sad that this writer should write with authority talking badly
about someone so illustrious when he didn't know the real facts. She was
   quite pale again.
   Johnny was convinced, but gently. "Tell them," he said hoarsely,
   "Tell a big whopper they will not know no better.! They will
   not guess where."

   And he briefly recounted his wild-goose chase gave minister.

   
   "And to get Dolly and cake," said Florry, eyes gleaming through tears.

   

"Ongoing," said Johnny.

"They will get back the doll, but relatives have eated the cake first." They looked at each other
and danced with their eyes over this heaven-sent inspiration. Then Johnny put shoes and socks,
rubbing her cold feet dirty handkerchief, and said: "Now trot on to you in March!"
He helped her lose the picket fence and was turning away when her weak voice called again.
"Johnny!"
He turned back, she was standing on the other side of the fence holding in her arms to him. He
went to her with shining eyes, raised her up, and the lips warm, loving little but took a
fatal kiss.
For only an hour later Mrs. Fraser Florry found in her bed, tossing with a high fever and a
light head. It was about "Johnny" and "gold", and had a small handful metal flake. When Mr.
Staples was sent for, and the mother and father, anxiously hanging above her bed, in their interrogation,
they could find willing Florry was only a high mountain, everything
so far, and top of this there was gold lying around, and was giving
away a brilliant figure in humans. 
"Who were the people, Florry
dear," said Mr. Staples persuasively, "you know anybody here?" 
"They

   His tombstone is most likely one of five slabs, engraved in

On one of these slabs is written "A prayer for Martan."
 

Everything is done in secret, from the time the prisoner is taken from the dungeon, with either
the jailer of keeper of the books entering from the officer's quarters, to the questioning of
the prisoner, if they are unable to get him to confess to the charge, then he will be sent
back again to the dungeon.
This place, the gaol of St. George's, is equipped with second floor
offices, which belongs to the governor and jaileer, no prisoner is
allowed access to space above the ground or first floor. There are other broader reasons why England and France
are antagonistic towards each other. It is questionable whether or not these states will force
other satellite states to do their will as they tried to do in Texas in 1844, or if the government
will triumph over the rebel states and coax them back into the Union.

This would have the effect of establishing our power again, especially in light of our monopoly
of cotton. It is easy to understand why England and France are manipulating as they are, but
the issue at hand affects us much more strongly than it does them.
It is not only a question of goodwill towards the freed African Americans of the South, nor
is it a question of how rich and powerful we are. Other dilemmas are much more important, and
they deal with the rights and interests of the citizens still in
the Union, in particular, the population of laboring white men throughout
the country.

 One such Leboeuf, who had been his fellow prisoner,
died in Creil few days later from a wound he had received on the road.  General von Kluck's army
arrived in Crepy-en-Valois on 2 September, and took four days to march through. The city was
completely looted under the eyes of the officers. In particular, jewelers shops were looted.

Theft of body jewelry and clothing were committed in a house in which he presented a commanding
general with a dozen officers of the General Staff. Almost all CrÃ©py safes were destroyed.

The March of the same month, in Baron, a talented artist, Professor Alberic Magnard, shot twice
with a revolver in a troop that he was entering his property. One soldier was killed and another
wounded. The Germans, who in many places the worst atrocities have been committed for no reason,
here are content to burn the property of their attacker. The latter committed suicide to avoid
falling into their hands. However, the town was fired. M. Robert, a notary, stole her jewelry,
clothing, and of 1,471 bottles of wine, and forced him to open the safe and allow an officer
to have 8300 francs, which were locked up there. At night, another officer saw her finger rings
of nine women, and whose arms were decorated with six bracelets.

Two soldiers told him, moreover, received an award of four marks each time brought their commanding
officers of a piece of jewelry.

In this county, ma'am. X., a very respectable young man, was raped by two soldiers in succession in
the absence of her husband, who is with colors. One of these two
men ransacked a comfortable while his partner was committing the crime.

Also, an intimation of God's wishes regarding what Man does is absolutely necessary, because "to
worship" means to supplicate and to obey; barring this, crucial details would be lacking, and
the entire apparatus would be flawed; humans would be kept in the dark about their responsibilities
to the Divine One. Add however the comprehension of our need of and kinship with God, with the
certainty of his desires in the shape of His commandments, with additional covenants tied to
our behavior in His eyes. This method of reinforcement would be ideal, both carrot and stick for
the human animal. Thus you, an unbeliever, must concur that the way of mankind is natural
and correct. The renowned Catherine,
wife of Peter the Great, is the same Lady Catherine that is mentioned near the end.

times, Elle FUT representÃ©e Trent deux fois. The account, which it is founded, we have from
the Antigone of Aristophanes prefix'd argument Grammarian: Latin
Translator and this argument has probably resulted in Father Brumoy
mistake and he should have the original referr'd. As for the pomp and magnificence, on account of participating in
this discourse, neither Greece, Rome, nor Egypt, whether for use,
difficulty, or state, you can compare any of his works with the road
to be seen in Peru, made by the kings of the country, the city of
Quito to Cusco (three hundred leagues), straight, even, five and twenty
paces wide, paved, and on both sides with high walls and beautiful,
and very close to them, and along inside, two perennial streams, bordered
by beautiful plants, which they call moly.

In this work, where they met with rocks and mountains, they cut, and made par, and filled the
pits and valleys with lime and stone to be level. At the end of each day journey are beautiful
palaces, furnished with supplies, clothing and weapons, and for travelers and hosts to be passed
through. The estimate of this work has had the difficulty is especially significant in that
place, not built with stones less than ten feet square, and had no
other means of transportation convenience, but by drawing their load
themselves arm strength and did not know as much as the art of scaffolding,
nor any other form of walking to work, but by throwing up earth against
the building as it stood, taking it away again when they had done.

Let us return to our coaches here. Instead of these, and all other types of carriages, that they
caused to be carried on the shoulders of men.
 Like Goethe's Mephistopheles said to his witch:
Culture is what seperates men from apes, but has also brought about wrongs.
People asked a lot of questions, such as, "How can they go up and down chimneys?" And "How can they
walk right through solid glass?" (The answer was also that the devil finds a way.) "How could
so many children be moved at the sa,e time?" Once they got to Blockula, the horrible initiation
began.
 It was very obvious that no one knew yet about
us owning a vast window-box.
"I'll leave you here," I said whilst smoking a cigar. I dipped into the catalogue again, "and purchase
something.
It is marked in the catalogue at one-and-sixpence (very cheap) which means they will probably
offer the nine-shilling size first.
But I will resist and stand my ground. Good-bye."
I purchased one and returned to her with my new purchase.
"No, not right now," I said, as she held out her hand expectingly. "Wait until we arrive at
our destination."
We cruised through the tents, it was much less warm out now, chatting to the stall-keeper whenever
we came to geraniums.
At the orchid we were adamant against. "Of course," I proclaimed, "for those who enjoy orchid-----"
and went back to the geraniums.
The afternoon was quite fascinating.
"Now!"  I yelled with such drama in my voice. I unveiled what I bought and placed it in the
center of our newly forged garden.
"Whatever---"
"A slug-trap."
"But how is it that slugs could get here?" Celia asked.
"How do slugs get anywhere?
They climb up wall. Sometimes they come up in the lift, or the wind blows them. I don't have a clue."
They can fly; but however it is I am ready to find them."
Our slug-trap will surely come in handy.
It doesn't matter that much, us gardeners desire rain.

DRASTIC REFORM OF SCHOOLS. 
Remarkable
Speech. 
No mention was made of Mr. Alfred Dunstanley's motion last
Thursday, under the ten-minutes rule, for leave to bring the Reform
of Public Schools in his Bill. That omission we are now able to make
good, thanks to the enterprise of a news reporter who was there during
the debate.  
Mr. Dunstanley claims he has no intention in annihilating
public schools. But he is positive reform must happen to extricate
anomalies that deter schools from progressing. The Bill said pending
the extinction of the hereditary peerage, peers or peers' sons, if
they insisted on going to public schools, should be segregated and
kept in a state of perpetual coventry. It was not advisable that the
healthy sons of our democracy should fraternize with those affluent
children. The Bill did not send them to their death but insisted they
pay higher fees. 
Mr. Dunstanley does not hate titled individualss.
But the facts were against them. Again, baronets were almostdepicted
in colours by the best novelists. In short their presence at our public
schools could not be tolerated, as even the children of good Radicals
were not immune to the danger of snobbery

 Pharoah asked: "Won't he wake up again? If two people pray together will love
turn down their prayer?"
"Maybe," she stated. "If two people prayed together, because if they prayed he would've heard
already!"
Pharoah was stirred emotionally by pity and sorrow. He turned to Meriamun and asked: "once you
did win my Crown at the Pieces, will you play me for your love?"
She was thinking about it. After a few minutes she replied: "Yes I
will play you, though I've lost my sly ways.

It may be that Meriamun loses again, she's lost everything already. Let me see the Pieces and
bring some wine."
After setting the Pieces she crossed the room. When she tried to offer it to Pharoah he was so
intent on the game he didn't drink.
They began to play the game. He started, then she. It went on like this in the Queen's chambers,
which were dark and fragrant. Her eyes shone in the night. The game went on until Pharoah won
and swept the board.
Screaming "Pharoah is dead!" he drank the poisoned cup of wind.
"Pharoah is dead," said Meriamun, looking deeply into his eyes.
Realizing he'd seen that look before in Meriamun's eyes, when she'd killed Hataska- Pharoah asked:
"What is that look in your eyes?" He grew white as a ghost when he realized the truth.
Meriamum shouted out "Pharoah is dead!" like a womean wailing at a funeral. "The great Pharoah is
dead! Before a man can count to a hundred the days are numbered. Odd. But tomorrow, Meneptah
will sit where Hataska sat dead at the knees of Death itself ,like an Osirin in the lap of Osiris.
Die Pharoah Die! But while you die, listen to me. There is someone
I love. The wandererer who leads your hosts. I stole his love via
my own witchcraft. He knew I stole his love and would've shamed me-
so I falsely accused him publically. But he will come again- and as
surely as you are sitting on the knees of Osiris, as surely he'll
sit on your throne, Pharoah." 

   He has decided for his life that it is bad to be restrained,
   and so he brags that he doesn't conform to the civility of
   the present day but instead has taken on the frankness of
   the days gone by and expresses his views plainly and freely.
   We really can't object to Mr. Sadler putting forth is theory
   about population with the outspokenness of the seventeenth century. 

If there was any truth in skipping the beliefs, they associate more explicitly to music, and musical
genres and science, than to the fine arts, that we have narrowed our views. Music is primarily
a social longing. It can be advanced only in the social scene, like clubs and bars. While genres
come and go when their popularity is snuffed out by the next big sound, while music that stays
arround for the ages is rare. A great musician can tune himself with his instument over the
stretch of time with much work and sweat put into aquiring his profesional status, he can stick to
his starting genre and compare his progress only to those who have played before him and have been declaired
as great. The best way to aquire this fame is to head to the "big city" and play among the people,
where he can be heard, those who decide to keep their talents to themselves will never make it
in the music industry.

It could seem odd at a quick glance, and well we can concider it to be placed into the argument,
that it is impossible that all forms of art seem lesser than literature in all its forms. Some
writers and playwrights have never fallen from fame even today, Shakspeare has three differing
forms of a single play out there. Poetry as stated in multiple different poems is immortal.
Book after book continues to trump the last "hit" out of the public's eye. The Twilight Series,
for example, quickly overtook the once popular Harry Potter Series.

Some people claim that their country has produced a higher quality of poet than any other. Honestly
who can say that their nation is better than all the others? There is no such thing as a better
brand of poet, because true poetry can be undersood and taken in by all its readers. The boasts
of superficial poets being compaired to one groups depth and understanding of their poems.

Whereas novels are for entertainment and are for the most part relaxing and effortless, music
takes a much deeper understanding. Music and fine arts require cultivation, one must be educated
to correctly arbitrate it, unlike poetry and common writing which
only takes the ability to read.

Even in mans vast history, you find that it is completely ordinary
in our civilizations, how poetry and via word of mouth, the most free
these versions of art have ever been are seen more in the early stages
of society, and with them we as human beings have transformed into
the most intellectual creatures on this planet.

Some of the earliest forms of wrighting have been destroyed and we will never know how some cultures
used words in the past. The Egyptians are the best example of this with the Ptolemies Library
being destroied, what remains of these people, and how they worked with stones that to this day
we cannot recreate show us that the arts can advance beyond the technology of the times. This
day and age we can only attain a small amount of these great peoples proficincy in their trade.
Flaxman stated that they were "mere beginners," and "laborious mechanics" When the Egyptian
art came to its abrupt end, the Greeks began. It seems that they had made only a small ammount
of progress towards the Egiptian greatness. Only a few artest from that time still have their
fame. Homer, Daedalus, and his student Eudaeus are among those few that have their names carved
into the stones of time, just as they have carved stone into the art that brought them their
fame.

she commented, "but we can't get another jockey. I guess Queen Bess just can't run."

Barbara simply stared at the country girl accusingly.
 Blessing walked away quietly to avoid spooking the bear. But the bear, Bruin, had
sighted and smelled the intruders, and at that point was already loping in their direction.

Hansen
stopped worrying about spooking Bruin, seeing that the bear was tracking Blessing's route in
the direction of the boat. Blessing noticed this too, and admitted to himself that the time for
thinking about the bear's feelings was over.

Blessing halted in his tracks, not sure what he should do next. After a minute of thinking, he
came to the conclusion that he was glad there were three of them
and only one bear and made his way back to the rest of the group at
top speed.

Bruin pursued, making good time.

It was quite clear to Hansen by then that the situation was serious, and he was ready to run
in a zigzag pattern like the manual recommended. First, though, he straightened up to make
himself tall, thrust out his arms to make himself look wide, and bellowed as loud as he could.
The others made noise too. That bear, though, didn't seem to take any notice. Things were going
sideways fast. The three grabbed their weapons of choice: Hansen had the long hooked stick for
ice breaking, Johansen held his axe, and Blessing readied for hand-to-hand combat. Each man yelled
to the bear wildly and at the top of their voices as they ran for
the boat with every ounce of speed they could muster.

And the bear just kept coming, ran towards their shelter, swiftly checking everything left in
the camp as he lumbered along in their direction.

This was a lithe, skinny bear, a hungry male. When he was finally gutted, the only content of
his tummy was a note inscribed with two names: Mohn and Lutken. The note was scrawled on a bit of
paper meant to cover a portable lantern such as a skier might carry, and someone from the expedition
must have dropped it while traveling the frozen wastes. After the incident with the bear, several
of the explorers refused to leave the boat unless they had as many
weapons as they could carry.

The wind came from the Southeast on October 3rd, a Tuesday, and continued that way into Wednesday,
the 4th. On the 3rd it was sixteen degrees below zero, and on the 4th it was a scant two degrees
warmer. That day I spent all my time checking depth, and the deepest point I measured was just
under one and half kilometers. I lifted up examples of the ten to eleven-and-a-half centimeter
thick grey clay shelf on the bottom, and noticed that it had roan clay or mud underneath. It
was above freezing down there, eighteen degrees Celsius on the bottom; in contrast, it was just
below freezing 137 meters up, about .18 degrees. This evidence disproves the myth of the shallowness
of these Arctic waters, confirming that they're warmer than people think.

As we brought up the sounding line that p.m., fissures formed in the ice behind the Fram, widening
so fast that our little ice anchor crew of three had to put a board down to cross back to the
boat. The ice compacted as the night came on, opening up more cracks behind that initial one.

I
had my clothes on Thursday a.m. in time for the morning meal, the 5th, when a crew member ran
in with a report about a bear sighting. I took the deck right away and spotted the bear approaching
from the side of the vessel sheltered by the wind, i.e. heading North in our direction. He
paused quite a ways away from us to check things out, then flopped down on the ice. With Henriksen
in tow, I set out over the frozen water. One of us managed to snipe into bear's chest from
about 284 meters away, a lucky shot, dropping the bear dead right
before he turned to run.

   

   
   As I write, we're getting all our stuff secure against the
   pressures of the freezing water for the long winter season.

In the p.m. today we packed up the boat's rudder. Nice day today for weather, but a nippy one.
It was eighteen below Celsius at eight o'clock tonight. The medical check found that there are
still insects on the boat, somehow, and I can't think of a solution to all of our problems. We're
out of power now, and will have to pray the cold will kill any vermin or disease.

Knowing critters were still kicking among us made me pretty sick with fear. If lice or bacteria
or a plague or whatever infested our gear, linens, and clothing, then we'd be finished fast.
The next day, we all went a little cleaning crazy, got as obsessive-compulsive about it as
we could under these conditions. We stripped out of everything we were wearing - everything
- then scrubbed clean and put on all new clothes. Our old stuff, all the old clothes, furs, rugs,
and gear, was stowed above deck to freeze solid there until spring.

That worked -- it was more than even the heartiest viruses could
handle. You know the old saying: a bug can handle being boiled, a
bug can handle an airtight seal, but no bug can stand to be out in
the deep cold of night in winter.

On Friday, the 6th, it was colder
yet, with the mercury reading -24 degrees Celcius. 

In a lot cases the causative relation of the preputial illness towards the symptoms which it
spawns is not so obvious as it may be within others, but as soon as exact counseling of the

nor those whom contributed towards his paper noticed. The expulsive
efforts ushering urination occasionally inflict prolapsus of the rectum,
and frequently produce inguinal hernia. I'm sure everyone
will be happy to do.

III. The King, a spiteful man wanted to curse the garden at Twickenham. Bishop Corbet's father
had a nursery at Twickenham garden's, and his curse seemed to be powerless.
The King stated 'May their memory with a force worthy of the excommunicator-wholesale, Pius IX.,
'be blotted out of the Book of Life; may their strength continually waste away, and be there
no restorative to repair it!' Although the kind sputtered his declorations there were over a hundred
and fifty plentiful acres of fruit gardents at Twickenham. There were even delcious raspberries
that grew all over, and this place had been lucious for years, even before Queen Elizabeth!

Old Works was a house on a piece of land that the Earl of Bradford's coachmen built in 1698. An
occupant by the name of Colley Cibber wrote his Comedy called 'Refusal; or the Ladies' Philosophy.'
The spot was so greatly admired that Talbot, Bishop of Durham, lived eight years in it, and
the Marquis of Carnarvon succeeded him as a tenant: next came Mrs. Chenevix, a famous French toy-woman.

Horace Walpole bought up Mrs. Chenevix's lease, and afterwards the fee-simple; and henceforth
became the busiest, if not the happiest, man in a simple way in existence.
The overrated Gothic style of Strawberry Hill;is hated for it's now
standing form.

   Although it is overrated for it's simplicity, it is underrated for
the many years it took to build--twenty three.It was begun in 1753,
and finished in 1776.

   

Strawberry Hill was chic and modern in a Gothic artistic way, and almost everything was designed
by Horace himself; all of the internal decorations such as the book-shelves, screens, niches,
and chimney.
Horace wss considered a social man of his time, but the irony of it all was the loneliness he
felt in his heart. No matter how many people could fill the room, he would always be empty,
and that was his--by nature.
Strawberry Hill was worth it, though. Imagine the time spent, the lonely hours and days, but with
that came the strength of a lonely with a growing imagination.
'The Strawberry Gazette,' Horace once wrote to a fine and titled lady, 'is very barren of weeds.'
Such, however, was rarely the case. Peers, and still better, peeresses,--politicians, actors,
actresses,--the poor poet who knew not where to dine, the Maecenas who was 'fed with dedications'--the
belle of the season, the demirep of many, the antiquary, and the dilettanti,--painters, sculptors,
engravers, all brought news to the 'Strawberry Gazette;' and incense, sometimes wrung from
aching hearts, to the fastidious wit who professed to be a judge of all material and immaterial
things--from a burlesque to an Essay on history or Philosophy--from
the construction of Mrs. Chenevix's last new toy to the mechanism
of a clock made in the sixteenth century, was lavished there. Once upon returning, when I met an old friend
of mine he was so excited to see me. He was so excited that he cried and ran in and out of
the room as if he had lost all control. His excitement was music to my ears.

As a consequence Owen is in position of authority for education, and hid her purse organizer, and
he did not flinch from the situation, he imposed no cheap improvised, because he believed in education
as an end and not an economic way a double institution was therefore established it in 1816,
some school-age children admitted, probably more than six, and one for those under school age,
whose only attempt at entry was their ability to walk . It is the latter that we are concerned.

Instructions given by Owen in man and women, he chose to serve kindergarten to demonstrate its
general purposes, children under their care were above all to be happy, to live naturally be outdoor
or indoor Weather permitting, learning their surroundings, play, music, dance, "not annoyed
with books," not shaded by the upper school needs, but lead a life of their age required. Education
Bill 1918 in light of this seems almost prophetic.
their guardians were selected solely on grounds of personality, and is expected to work in the
spirit in which Owen designed school. They were gentle, without personal ambition, caring for
children, caring only for their welfare, but Owen was the only guiding principle, and this
was the least of school success and doom for Owen's personality was
made round so pin which turns the school, without him there was nothing
to grasp. Now-a-days, it seems very profitable which means that it had been
well managed in the past.

Since the central Dominican railroad goes from Puerto Plata in the north to Santiago de los
Caballeros 41miles away, extending to Moca 16 miles a total coming to 57miles, the name of the
other Dominican railroad is also often misleading.
It got this name because it was considered the initial section of the road which connects Puerto
Plata and Santo Domingo City.
This road was and still is urgently needed and hence the construction of the road between Santiago
and the coast was more imperative than ever.
The existing mountain roads were in a very bad condition and hence travelling from one place to
the other was tedious and transporting goods was done from either place by mule-back.
It was fortunate in 1890 that the president Heuraux and the Dominican government was able to
make contracts with Westerndrop & Co. for the road section between Pluerto Plata to Santiago.

Belgian engineers made the plans and their money was furnished.
The gauge given to the road was two feet six inches and the short-sightedness is inconceivable
which permitted the adoption on this road of a gauge different from that of the Samana-Santiago
Railroad, when the two were expected to join in Santiago. Ultimately a high cost will be incurred
for the complete renovation of the rolling stock when the guage of the Central Dominican Railway
will have to be widened.
The plans contemplated the construction at several places of the road because of the unaccounted
steepness of the slopes. There was a third track provided between the two, to use several mounting
climbing locomotives using which the ascent was completed and the descent regulated.
The road was built by the Belgian engineers from Puerto Plata to Bajabonico which came to about
eleven miles.
Now the financial crisis of the Dominican government forced the Belgians to sell their rights
to American interests and this gave rise to the San Domingo Improvement Company to take over
them. Hence the road to Santiago was completed by the American engineers. A rack-rail was not
desired so the road was planned to be constructed as an adhesion road.
The rack-rail was not built further and a portion that was previously constructed was converted
and there were two other short stretches of rack-rail near Puerto Plata, which were one and
three miles respectively.
The Central Dominican Railway Company was incorporated for the operation of the road.  The
San Domingo Improvement Company contended that the road had cost
in the neighbourhood of $3,000,000, or about $600,000 in excess of
the sums realized by the sale of the bonds assigned by the government
to defray the cost of construction during the controversy.  
The
protocol of January 31, 1903, brought about the solution and by this,
the Dominican government agreed to purchase all the holdings of the
Company. In the talks that followed, the actual cost of the railroad
was estimated to be $1,500,000. OSIM "quoth the Baron!, The excellent French language, you can get from me (if I part
with him) that the hole card is not a kind of half and half of the book, but it is entertaining.

and suggests that the volume should be re-titled Gathered Leaves from the Dean Hole's Rose Garden,

MARION Crawford Don Orsino (published by Macmillan & Co) should be worth reading was only color
word-painting, and its high-comedy dialogue. However, Mr. Crawford gave rather to interrupt the
story for the sake of moralizing about age trends, and the reader, although he can be patient
when he became interested by the novel's characters, not to care be button-holed by a digression.
MARION recipe Crawford love to start a dialogue (at the beginning of Vol. III). which is to lead

first remark is on the seat. Mr. Crawford remembers, of course, old story of how the tenor

that every man behaves awkwardly when you're in love, and the lack of one is a presumption of
absence of the other. When people are very committed, it is perhaps less of this object directly,
but there is still much of it in his presence, but it is wonderful how soon the most nervous

   Laugh not at him again, because surely be your husband.
   Love, when it succeeds well enough, and perhaps has treasures

 You cannot think of a more
impactful image. The river is amazingly rapid and crystal clear, with a bed full of rocks, and the
banks seem to be rock faces that go straight up for a signigicant distance down the shorline. I
hear that in the winter, the Aar often causes a lot of trouble as it has a lot of water and is
the perfect example of a gushing mountain stream. This reminded me of the streams found in Wales,
especially the ones in some parts of the Dee. I arrived in Brohl a little late due to this
detour that took a little longer than I thought it would. However, I arrived in time for dinner
at the old Gasthoff. I enjoyed my meal and a flask of Rhenish wine with a new German friend
who was staying there as well and this made up for all the difficulties of the day.
I was hit with the pieces of lava rock and burnt remains of trees and bushes spattered over the
marshes as I took off from Brohl along the Brohl Stream that comes
from Lake Laach.

   Soon, I arrived at the valley made of tufa, or trass as
   it is known in the country. Tufa is a dull blue colored hard
   clay that, when dry, becomes a shade of light gray.

This stones is very popular in Holland and so is quarried in the valley and sent along the Rhine.
A Dutchmann settled Nippes a century ago for its great location for exporting trass. The stone
found at the bottom of the formation is preferred as it is the hardest and most dense. The upper part
is loose and sandy, and therefore not useful. Since the Brohl Stream is really only a liquified
river of trass, it is thick as pea-soup, and is not clear like the Aar.
 Here was
an opportunity for Christ's disciple to demonstrate his heroic, benign
gospel.

His omnipresent brandy bottle embraced his heart, hidden, and he
felt it.

He looked nonchalantly over the bushes at the wretched soul lying there passed out. And that
form was familiar to him. It must be her, he thought, because he had pedaled through the town
after the hunt had begun. The whole town was buzzing with the news of Miss Vancourt's sudden
appearance that morning. She had been the hunt's matriarch. In fact, she had ridden by him at
full tilt. He grinned and brushed the sweat from his brow.
"Royalty will soon be dethroned," he murmured quietly, "And,thankfully,those empty seats will
soon be filled! Now, if that coward Walden were here -- "
He stopped and thought. The lingering memory of the disgrace he had endured because of Julian
Adderley stuck in his mind. It was an  injustice, and all because of this very woman that, perhaps,
lay dead or dying before him. He parted the damaged bushes, carefully advancing  toward "Cleopatra."
A sick thought took root: He could scare the animal, and it would stomp her body completely.
And, as demented as the thought was, it came easily to him. He aided in the demise of butterflies,
so why not this woman? The action was the same in both cases. He attempted to grab the horse's
bridle, but the animal stood steadfast. She would not budge. Her huge kind eyes warned him
of attempting another indiscretion.

She wasn't in the mood for games. Again, he stopped and thought.
"Oliver Leach passed by," he pondered, "And went by almost at the same time she did. I wonder
if he did it?" He reached for his filthy handkerchief and smoothed his face with gentle care
as though it  belonged to a gentleman. "I wouldn't be shocked," he quietly said to himself,
" if he had arranged this nasty affair.

Ingenious! Deadly hunting accidents are not rare. He is aware of this fact. And so am I. But
I will find the truth. Yes, I will find the truth!"
He nearly jumped out of his own skin! Suddenly, "Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt," flexed her lengthy
bowed neck and bellowed a pitiful, begging yelp. An almost mystical quiet followed the horse's
cry, a calm interrupted only by a smattering of rain drops.
 However, mechanization of the
anchor-setting phase would destroy all that.

Destroying that would be a shame.

Even though I was only a small part of the Belt team, and my never
know what it feels like to be an actual member, I have an idea what
it may feel like. And I am proud to say I have scrimmaged the team,
and am even more proud to sit on the side-lines and cheer. Oh, it was not the worst. Being stuck in a menial job did improve
my circumstances. When the King of Navarre entered St. Jean I did now want to face the people
below who were so poor in moral and virtue. I wanted to stay indoors and wear out my welcome
in the hostel I could afford.

So sorry, the world is strange. My reflections on that day, I remember, were of the most melancholy.
I grow old, I shall wear my trousers rolled and my pockets were empty and my mustache betrayed
my own poverty. You could not misake me for the meanest ruffler.
I had still a rock and a few barren acres in Brittany, the last remains
of the family property; but the small small sums which the peasants
could afford to pay were sent annually to Paris, to my mother, who
had no other dower.

I could not betray her and a die a proper man.
I nevertheless did all I could, in the only way that occurred to me. I drew up a petition, and
lying in wait one day for M. Forget, the King of Navarre's secretary, placed it in his hand,
begging him to lay it before that prince. But he was careless with thrust away the paper on which
I had spent so much labour. His valet, who ran after me to get the customary present--and ran,
as I still blush to remember, in vain--warned me to refrain from
hope.

At length, on the morning of the third day--I remember it lacked but three of Christmas--I heard
a step on the stairs.

I would not, however, run the risk of a mistake, and before holding out my hand, I asked him
directly and with formality if it was for me.

My first glance at the messenger confirmed me in my highest hopes,
as well as in all I had ever heard of the generosity of the King of
Navarre.

The messanger was a page, a young man who had pestered me in the street the day prior.
;The King of Navarre, sir,' he said, with a low bow, 'will receive
your answer in person, I believe.' And with that, replacing the hat
which he had doffed out of respect to me, he turned and went down
the stairs.

Once he left, I opened the letter and the hope I found exceeded all of my greatest expectations.
 Were they leaving to be capable to remain it off? There was to be no
assist from Judge Whipple, who sat in harsh stillness. A man who feels his heart ablaze is not
agreed to minute chat. Virginia alone had still crazed the authority to compose him forget.

"Uncle Silas, I am certain here are a few belongings about our journey
that we never told you.

How we saw Napoleon and his gorgeous Empress driving in the Bois, and how Eugenie smiled and
bent at the public. I never saw such eagerness in my existence.

And oh, I educated such a lot of French history. All regarding Francis the First and Pa took me
to observe his chateaus along the Loire. Very little tourists go there. You actually must have
gone with us."
Take care, Virginia!

"I had extra job to complete, Jinny," said the Judge.
Virginia upset an.
"I told you that we stayed among actual lord in England, didn't I?" said she. "He wasn't partially
as kind as the Prince. But he had an attractive residence in Surrey, every window, which was built
in Elizabeth's era. They called the design Tudor, didn't they, Pa?"
"Yes, darling," said the Colonel, smiling.  
"The Countess was fine
to me," continued the young woman, "and took me to garden parties.
But Lord Jermyn was constantly chatting politics."  
The Colonel
was stroking his goatee.  
"Tell Silas regarding the home, Jinny--Jackson,
assist the Judge once more."  
"No," said Virginia, drawing a gasp.
"I'm going to inform him about that funny club where my great-grand-father
used to gamble with Charles Fox. We saw a vast many places where Richard
Carvel had been in England. That was earlier than the Rebellion. Uncle
Daniel read me several of his memoirs when we were at Calvert House.
I make out that you would be attracted in them, Uncle Silas. He sailed
beneath Paul Jones."  
"And fought for his nation and for his flag,
Virginia," said the Judge, who had barely spoken until then. "No,
I might not tolerate to study them at present, when individuals who
must adore that nation are departure it in obsession."  
There was
a deep quiet. Virginia did not challenge to gaze at her father. But
the Colonel said, quietly:  
"Not in obsession, Silas, but in grief."
The Judge tightened his mouth. But the attempt was away from him,
and the flood inside him broke slack.  
"Colonel Carvel," he cried,
"South Carolina is mad--She is passing in offense, in order that a
brutal practice may be perpetuated.
