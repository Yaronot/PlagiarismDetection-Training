To be sown from the 10th to the 20th of the Month.

One load of horse-dung, or twenty barrows-full, will be sufficient for a one-light box, and
let it be put together at least three weeks before making the bed, in a round or square heap,
being particular in well treading it down. If the dung is dry, it will be necessary to give
it some water; if very dry, a dozen pots will be required. Let it lay in this state a week,
and then turn it, shaking the outsides of the heap into the middle, and give it some more water.
In doing this, it is requisite that the heap should be well shook to pieces, and trod down.
Let it lay another week, at the expiration of which, observe the same directions as before
given, applying the quantity of water in proportion to the dry nature of the dung. At the end
of the third week, it will be in a proper condition to make use of, as by that time it will
be sufficiently moist and hot, the necessary state in which it should be, before the formation
of the bed.

As much depends upon the nature of the dung, and its proper condition, great attention should
be paid, and some judgment exercised in the means best calculated to prepare it for a state
of fermentation. The most certain method that can be adopted, and likely to ensure a beneficial
result is, in the summer months, to pack the dung you intend to make use of for the October
seed-bed as close together as possible, taking care to keep it dry, that it may retain its
virtue. This sort of dung is far preferable to that newly made, being less rank and not so
liable to burn; and when under a state of preparation, by turning and moistening, as before
described, it will be in a much better condition than any that can be fresh procured.[1]

Before forming the bed, let the bottom be made in the following manner:--Raise the ground about
six inches above the level with road sand or mould, upon the top of which place some fagots,
or other kind of wood, to the height of a foot, in order that the bed may be well drained.
If there is an insufficiency of dung, you can add a foot of dry rubbish, such as strawberry
or asparagus halm, or any other loose stuff. Let the bottom be extended nine inches wider than
the frame you intend to make use of, the height of the bed being at the back four feet, and
in the front, three feet nine inches. Beat it well down with a fork; then put the box on, and
fill it three parts full with the shovellings of the dung that is left; after which, place
on the light, and let it be close shut down. As soon as you discover the heat rising, admit
air by opening the frame about an inch: when it increases, so as to become very hot, admit
more air, by extending the aperture to two inches. It must remain in this situation about a
week; then fork it up above a foot deep, and if caked together, or in the least dry, give it
more water. From two to four pots is generally sufficient; but the quantity must be regulated
by the state of the bed. Here it is necessary to observe, that moisture is of most important
consequence to the seed-bed, and nothing is so well calculated to sweeten and cleanse it from
impurity as water.

In two or three days after forking up, it will be necessary to take off the box and light,
for the purpose of making the bed even. In doing this, stir it up from about the depth of a
foot, and shake it to pieces; then put on the box again, and give the light one or two inches
of air, according to the temperature of the weather.

It will now be necessary to wrap up the bed with straw, pea-halm, or hay, about eighteen inches
wide at the bottom, drawing it in gradually to a foot wide, within three inches of the top
of the box.

In three or four days stir up the bed in the same manner as before, observing that if it be
in the least dry, or inclined to a burning heat, to give it three or more pots of water, as
shall seem necessary. It must be stirred up again in three or four days, and beat down gently
with a fork, when it will be in a fit state to receive the old tan or mould in which the seed
is to be deposited.

A seed-bed should always lay a fortnight or three weeks before the seed is attempted to be
sown; as many evil consequences are to be apprehended from sowing it before, from the firing
of the bed, or the impure nature of the dung. If this be not strictly attended to, the plants
will not be brought to that degree of perfection, as might reasonably be expected from a bed
in its proper heat and condition.[2]

After the bed has been laid and dealt with according to the foregoing directions, spread two
barrows-full of old tan or light mould all over the surface, having it a little deeper in the
middle than at the sides. Old tan is certainly more preferable than mould, though either will
answer the purpose. Let it be put in the frame the day before the seed is sown, and cover the
bed up with a single mat at night, taking care to shut it down until the morning, that the
heat may be properly drawn up. Take some forty-eight size pots, and mix a quantity of leaf
mould with a sixth proportion of road sand, not sifted fine. The sifting mould to a fine degree
is an error too prevalent in horticulture, and ought particularly to be avoided, from its great
tendency to bind.

It is very requisite that a cucumber should have a good digestion, and in order to accomplish
this, it will be necessary to cover the holes at the bottom of the pots with broken pieces;
then strew a little of the rough siftings of the mould over it, and fill them up within half
an inch of the brim with the prepared mould and sand. Shake it down a little, and sow the seed[3]
from eighteen to twenty-four in a pot, just covering it with a little mould; then give it a
small quantity of water, which for the first time may be cold, but great care must be taken
in the subsequent waterings, that it be chilled to about the warmth of new milk.

The seed being sown, plunge the pots in the bed up to the rim, and give them about half an
inch of air. At night they must be covered with a single mat, taking care to turn it up at
at the back, that the steam may pass freely from the bed. Let the air be continued both night
and day.

After the seed has been sown three days, it will be up, when the pots must be unplunged, placed
on the surface, and some water given to them. They will now require upwards of an inch of air,
both night and day, which will cause the plants to grow stuggy, or dwarfish, and prevent their
drawing. In about three days give them some more water in the morning, and they will be ready
to pot off in the afternoon.

Plants should be always potted off when young, as they strike more freely in the pots; and,
in doing this, the following directions should be attended to.

Put the mould in the bed to chill, the day before potting off, and let it be of the same description
as that in which the seed was sown. If the pots are old and dirty, wash them, and be careful
in having them properly dried before they are made use of. Take some old rotten turf, or a
little of the coarse siftings of the leaf mould, and place a small quantity over the tile at
the bottom of every pot; then fill them about one-third full, put three plants in each, and
cover the roots about an inch. The pots must not be plunged, but placed on the surface, and
some water given them with a fine rose.

It is necessary to have a small pot on purpose to water the plants, which will contain about
three quarts, and has a hollow fine rose, which is much better calculated to water the plants
regularly than a spreading one.

Be particular in watering them regular, which will be requisite every two or three days, for
the space of three weeks or a month at latest, when they will be in a proper condition to ridge
out.

After the plants have been potted three days, add a little mould to them, and repeat it every
two or three days, for about a fortnight, until the pot is quite filled. Much attention should
be paid to this method of putting in the mould, which experience has convinced the author is
far superior to the usual practice of filling the pots in the first instance up to the seed-leaves
of the plants. Likewise, i wish a burlesque, and i am fond of a Panto, but do a concoction of
blank to decease and black-fire is instead too much for me insured, especially when that mixture
is not redeemed by plot interest. Nothing can be more absurd than the tearjerker (save the
grade!) state in this play. It look that a "Peer!" to Athinai marry the Queen of the Amazons,
and during the bridal rejoicings being sown the daughter as one of his topic to "verse the fatality"
unless she transferred her fondness from own love to a turn of her
father's choice.

The gentleman of her thumb's choice was beloved in his time by a friend of his would-not-be betrothed,
and the play which lasted from eight until nearly midnight, was not devoted down to this simple
(in more awareness than one) bill right. By a adapter, October King is of the Elf pointed if
the two doubleton of its admirer during its sleep in a wood, so that one lady had two admirers
and the other none. Wholly that was forced to convey when the piece to a conclusion to much exercise
magic when the couples have paired off, of course, in a manner to give gratification to their
friends and roots. This was the scheme. There was now and may again examine some attempts to
gentleman amateur theatricals into disrespect by the induction of a party of village histrions,
who were allowed to "clown" to their heart body; and voilà tout! The
mounting is excellent.

Nothing best than "a Wood near Athens," they painted by Mr. HEMSLEY,
has been understand since Prof HERKOMER are galvanize the world to
his delegacy of village life at Bushey.

The section, rather (chiefly from the brewery of MENDELSSOHN), is always charming, and frequently
geraldine. Moreover, Mr. BENSON, no feeling that his writer required this support, has introduced
a figure in pretty dances, executed up by comely maidens require of ages varying from seven to (say)
seven-and-twenty. Of course, such play required really ordinary move.
Mr. BENSON was, on the fractional, a Lysander, Mr. otho STUART a dignified
Oberon, and Mr. STEPHEN PHILLIPS too require each best of the settlement
histrions.

Miss and GRACE appropriate was also fanciful in the rôle of a sort
at dwarf.

But, allowing for the music, and the scenery, and the acting, the piece myself was unimpeachably
dull. And now, having given you my unbiassed sentiment, i beg to token, your unprejudiced Subscriber
upwards. P. S.-- i am told that the author of a Solstice'purpose Nightmare wrote the amount of
other plays of considerable merit. Every situation, the more particularly as those who swear by Mr.
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE however admit as his purpose is a deterrent instead
than an attraction on a play-imbroglio.

 Cover the lining with the litter four inches wide from the bottom, and three parts
as high as the box, being particularly careful in stopping up the inside, by pressing the tan
close to the box, about three inches above the bottom. As the lining sinks, add a little wrapping
to the top, formed of hay, or old litter that is quite sweet.

FOOTNOTES:

[1] Dung put together in the above manner, will retain its virtue from six to nine months.

[2] The heat required in October sown plants, while growing in the seed-bed, is from sixty-five
to seventy degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer. Should that temperature be exceeded in this
season, they will draw up very long: but after being ridged out, more heat will become necessary;
that is to say, from seventy to eighty degrees: and the same is to be observed with young plants
raised in the three following months.

[3] Some gardeners are very particular in having seed that is three or four years old, imagining
that new will grow too vigorous, and not show fruit or set so well; but in this they are much
mistaken, the Author knowing, from experience, that new seed, or at least not more than two
years old, is the best calculated for bringing to perfection both the cucumber and melon; possessing
the advantage of a greater freedom in growth, and much finer fruit than can be derived from
old seed.

THE FRUITING FRAME,

For Plants sown in October, November, December, and January.

Four loads of dung will be sufficient for a three-light box, and the same in proportion to
the number you intend to make use of. Let it be put together a fortnight before the seed is
sown; be very particular in giving it plenty of water, and pack it close together. After it
has laid a week turn it, and if dry, moisten it with water. Let it continue in this state another
week, when the same directions as before given must be observed; and, in a week more, the bed
will be in a fit condition to make up.

The bottom must be prepared in the same manner as directed for the seed-bed; then form the
bed of dung four feet three inches at the back, by four feet in the front, allowing for a cavity
of about ten inches between each box; then place the boxes on, and put the shovellings inside,
in the proportion of two or three barrows-full to a light. In forming the bed, it is the best
plan to make it in layers of about a foot each, which will cause the dung to be much better
mixed, than if all finished at first, of an equal height. Be very particular in separating
the dung, and breaking it to pieces, afterwards beating it well down with a fork.

After the bed has been thus prepared, put the lights on, and shut them down close until the
heat begins to rise. When such is the case, give them about an inch of air; and in three or
four days wrap the bed all round with dry litter or useless hay, eighteen inches wide from
the bottom, sloping it in to about a foot as high as the bed, which will greatly tend to promote
a regular heat. As the careful wrapping up of the bed is an essential requisite, means must
be taken to keep it close, and protect it from any injury that may arise in consequence of
tempestuous weather, this may be accomplished by means of sharp-pointed sticks, with hooks
in the form of a peg, and about the size and length of a broom-stick. Thrust these through
the litter into the bed, about half way up, one to each light, at the back and front, and two
at each end.

After the bed has been made about a week or ten days, take off the boxes and lights, in order
to level it, and let it have from four to six inches fall from the back to the front; in this,
however, you must be in some degree guided by the form of the boxes, which it is necessary
should have a good fall, that the plants may derive benefit from the sun; then fork up the
bed about a foot deep, and again place on the boxes and lights, giving nearly two inches of
air, both night and day. In about four or five days it will be necessary to again fork it up,
and give it some water, in the proportion of two pots to a light. This must be repeated every
two or three days, until the bed is perfectly sweet, which is usually the case in three or
four weeks, applying water during that time, according to the state of the bed.

When you find that the bed is properly purified, put in the sifted leaf mould. A three-light
box will require a large barrow-full; the quantity for a one-light being about four shovels.
After this, add to the wrapping some sweet litter or hay, increasing it to nearly the top of
the boxes, and apply about two pots of water to each of the cavities, taking care to fill them
up to nearly the tops of the boxes, with short sweet mulshy litter. This is a point but very
little known, yet of the greatest importance in the culture of cucumbers; for when the weather
begins to grow severe, if there is no cavity, and the boxes are placed close together, in the
usual manner, the outsides are very liable to become damp, and the cold, penetrating through,
is certain of doing the plants material injury.

Put a pot of plants in the middle of a three-light box, and at night admit nearly two inches
of air, covering them with a single mat; and if on the following day the plants look well,
they may be safely ridged out.

It is requisite that both the boxes and lights should be painted every year, at least a month
before they are wanted for use; but if this cannot be conveniently done, be particular in washing
them with boiling water, in which some unslacked lime must be mixed. This will in some measure
answer the purpose of paint in effectually destroying the vermin, or the eggs which may have
been deposited in the crevices of the wood.

After the plants are ridged out, wash them every morning, on the outside, and about once a
week in the inside, which will tend to reflect the light, and cause them to thrive much better.
When you wash the outside, push them down about two or three inches, which will prevent the
water from perishing the lining at the side of the boxes. If the plants have received no injury,
and are able to bear the heat of the bed, ridge them out, letting the hills be about nine inches
high, covering the roots about an inch round, and being an inch higher than they were when
in the pots. If there is any surplus mould, rake it with the hand all over the bed; then water
the plants, taking care, at the same time to sprinkle the bed regularly upon the surface. Close
them down for the space of ten minutes, and then admit an inch of air. If the weather is mild,
in an hour it may be increased to two inches, and a single mat only will be requisite at night.
If, however, the weather is windy, cover them at night with a double mat, or a single one and
a little hay.

Be very particular in allowing them plenty of air, especially of a night, taking care, however,
to regulate this by the temperature of the weather. If there is much wind, they will of course
require less air; but, at all events, it is better to give too much than otherwise, more particularly
at the first ridging out, as the weather at this season being frequently subject to sudden
changes, which, should it occur in the night, and the plants are too confined, or the least
rankness existing in the bed, they are sure to experience material injury, which, at this time
of year, it is very improbable they will ever recover; or, if with extreme difficulty, they
should be brought round, they can never be expected to grow to any degree of perfection.

Stir up the bed every day for a fortnight to the depth of about nine inches, with a hand-fork,
and if you discover any fire-heat, immediately give water to the part affected, that being
the only effectual remedy that can be applied. Be careful in forking close to the bottom of
the hills, and if you ascertain that it fires much in this place, bore several holes at the
bottom of the hills, and apply plenty of water.

Have a sharp-pointed stick, about six or eight inches long, for the purpose of stirring the
mould round the plants, in a similar manner to hoeing a crop in a garden. This will very much
refresh the plants, and should be attended to while they are young, for at least two months
the day after they have been watered.

box.



As the lining settles, press it down with a spade next the box, and add more litter upon the
top, which should be done every other day, observing that when you increase one lining to have
the dung in readiness for the next; each lining not being calculated to last more than a month
or five weeks; though the back one will not want renewing quite so often as the front. When
you apply the second front lining, it will be necessary to bore the bed with a hedge-stake
or mop-stick, making five holes to a three-light box; that is, one under each hill, and two
under the bars: bore them straight rather better than half way up the bed, so that when the
second back lining is applied, holes may be bored exactly opposite to the others. This will
cause a free circulation of the heat from one lining to the other, and prove not only of great
service in regulating the temperature of the bed, but of equal advantage in draining off the
surplus water. Take care when you add a fresh lining, to keep the holes open.
