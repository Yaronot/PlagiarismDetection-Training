Something also had transpired concerning her being born on All-hallow Eve, and the powers with
which that circumstance was supposed to invest her over the invisible world. And from all-these
particulars combined, the young men and women of the Halidome used to distinguish Mary among
themselves by the name of the Spirit of Avenel, as if the fair but fragile form, the beautiful
but rather colourless cheek, the dark blue eye, and the shady hair, had belonged rather to
the immaterial than the substantial world. The general tradition of the White Lady, who was
supposed to wait on the fortunes of the family of Avenel, gave a sort of zest to this piece
of rural wit. It gave great offence, however, to the two sons of Simon Glendinning; and when
the expression was in their presence applied to the young lady, Edward was wont to check the
petulance of those who used it by strength of argument, and Halbert by strength of arm. In
such cases Halbert had this advantage, that although ho could render no aid to his brother's
argument, yet when circumstances required it, he was sure to have that of Edward, who never
indeed himself commenced a fray, but, on the other hand, did not testify any reluctance to
enter into combat in Halbert's behalf or in his rescue.

But the zealous attachment of the two youths, being themselves, from the retired situation
in which they dwelt, comparative strangers in the Halidome, did not serve in any degree to
alter the feelings of the inhabitants towards the young lady, who seemed to have dropped amongst
them from another sphere of life. Still, however, she was regarded with respect, if not with
fondness; and the attention of the Sub-Prior to the family, not to mention the formidable name
of Julian Avenel, which every new incident of those tumultuous times tended to render more
famous, attached to his niece a certain importance. Thus some aspired to her acquaintance out
of pride while the more timid of the feuars were anxious to inculcate upon their children the
necessity of being respectful to the noble orphan. So that Mary Avenel, little loved because
little known, was regarded with a mysterious awe, partly derived from fear of her uncle's moss-troopers,
and partly from her own retired and distant habits, enhanced by the superstitious opinions
of the time and country.

It was not without some portion of this awe, that Mysie felt herself left alone in company
with a young person so distant in rank, and so different in bearing, from herself; for her
worthy father had taken the first opportunity to step out unobserved, in order to mark how
the barnyard was filled, and what prospect it afforded of grist to the mill. In youth, however,
there is a sort of free-masonry, which, without much conversation, teaches young persons to
estimate each other's character, and places them at ease on the shortest acquaintance. It is
only when taught deceit by the commerce of the world, that we learn to shroud our character
from observation, and to disguise our real sentiments from those with whom we are placed in
communion.

Accordingly, the two young women were soon engaged in such objects of interest as best became
their age. They visited Mary Avenel's pigeons, which she nursed with the tenderness of a mother;
they turned over her slender stores of finery, which yet contained some articles that excited
the respect of her companion, though Mysie was too good-humoured to nourish envy. A golden
rosary, and some female ornaments marking superior rank, had been rescued in the moment of
their utmost adversity, more by Tibb Tacket's presence of mind, than by the care of their owner,--who
was at that sad period too much sunk in grief to pay any attention to such circumstances. 
They struck Mysie with a deep impression of veneration; for, excepting what the Lord Abbot
and the convent might possess, she did not believe there was so much real gold in the world
as was exhibited in these few trinkets, and Mary, however sage and serious, was not above being
pleased with the admiration of her rustic companion.

Nothing, indeed, could exhibit a stronger contrast than the appearance of the two girls;--the
good-humoured laughter-loving countenance of the Maid of the Mill, who stood gazing with unrepressed
astonishment on whatever was in her inexperienced eye rare and costly, and with an humble,
and at the same time cheerful acquiescence in her inferiority, asking all the little queries
about the use and value of the ornaments, while Mary Avenel, with her quiet composed dignity
and placidity of manner, produced them one after another for the amusement of her companion.

As they became gradually more familiar, Mysie of the Mill was just venturing to ask, why Mary
Avenel never appeared at the May-pole, and to express her wonder when the young lady said she
disliked dancing, when a trampling of horses at the gate of the tower interrupted their conversation.

Mysie flew to the shot-window in the full ardour of unrestrained female curiosity. "Saint Mary!
sweet lady! here come two well-mounted gallants; will you step this way to look at them ?"

"No," said Mary Avenel, "you shall tell me who they are."

"Well, if you like it better," said Mysie--"but how shall I know them?---Stay, I do know one
of them, and so do you, lady; he is a blithe man, somewhat light of hand, they say, but the
gallants of these days think no great harm of that. He is your uncle's henchman, that they
call Christie of the Clinthill; and he has not his old green jerkin and the rusty blackjack
over it, but a scarlet cloak, laid down with silver lace three inches broad, and a breast-plate
you might see to dress your hair in, as well as in that keeking-glass in the ivory frame that
you showed me even now. Come, dear lady, come to the shot-window and see him."

"If it be the man you mean, Mysie," replied the orphan of Avenel, "I shall see him soon enough,
considering either the pleasure or comfort the sight will give me."

"Nay, but if you will not come to see gay Christie," replied the Maid of the Mill, her face
flushed with eager curiosity, "come and tell me who the gallant is that is with him, the handsomest,
the very lovesomest young man I ever saw with sight."

"It is my foster-brother, Halbert Glendinning," said Mary, with, apparent indifference; for
she had been accustomed to call the sons of Elspeth her foster-brethren, and to live with them
as if they had been brothers in earnest.

"Nay, by Our Lady, that it is not," said Mysie; "I know the favour of both the Glendinnings
well, and I think this rider be not of our country.  He has a crimson velvet bonnet, and long
brown hair falling down under it, and a beard on his upper lip, and his chin clean and close
shaved, save a small patch on the point of the chin, and a sky-blue jerkin slashed and lined
with white satin, and trunk-hose to suit, and no weapon but a rapier and dagger--Well, if I
was a man, I would never wear weapon but the rapier!  it is so slender and becoming, instead
of having a cartload of iron at my back, like my father's broad-sword with its great rusty
basket-hilt. Do you not delight in the rapier and poniard, lady?"

"The best sword," answered Mary, "if I must needs answer a question of the sort, is that which
is drawn in the best cause, and which is best used when it is out of the scabbard."

"But can you not guess who this stranger should be?" said Mysie.

"Indeed, I cannot even attempt it; but to judge by his companion, it is no matter how little
he is known," replied Mary.

"My benison on his bonny face," said Mysie, "if he is not going to alight here! Now, I am as
much pleased as if my father had given me the silver earrings he has promised me so often;--nay,
you had as well come to the window, for you must see him by and by whether you will or not."
I do not know how much sooner Mary Avenel might have sought the point of observation, if she
had not been scared from it by the unrestrained curiosity expressed by her buxom friend; but
at length the same feeling prevailed over her sense of dignity, and satisfied with having displayed
all the indifference that was necessary in point of decorum, she no longer thought herself
bound to restrain her curiosity.

From the outshot or projecting window, she could perceive that Christie of the Clinthill was
attended on the present occasion by a very gay and gallant cavalier, who, from the nobleness
of his countenance and manner, his rich and handsome dress, and the showy appearance of his
horse and furniture, must, she agreed with her new friend, be a person of some consequence.

Christie also seemed conscious of something, which made him call out with more than his usual
insolence of manner, "What, ho! so ho! the house! Churl peasants, will no one answer when I
call?--Ho! Martin,--Tibb,--Dame Glendinning--a murrain on you, must we stand keeping our horses
in the cold here, and they steaming with heat, when we have ridden so sharply?"

At length he was obeyed, and old Martin made his appearance. "Ha!" said Christie, "art thou
there, old Truepenny? here, stable me these steeds, and see them well bedded, and stretch thine
old limbs by rubbing them down; and see thou quit not the stable till there is not a turned
hair on either of them."

Martin took the horses to the stable as commanded, but suppressed not his indignation a moment
after he could vent it with safety. "Would not any one think," he said to Jasper, an old ploughman,
who, in coming to his assistance, had heard Christie's imperious injunctions, "that this loon,
this Christie of the Clinthill, was laird or lord at least of him? No such thing, man! I remember
him a little dirty turnspit boy in the house of Avenel, that every body in a frosty morning
like this warmed his fingers by kicking or cuffing! and now he is a gentleman, and swears,
d--n him and renounce him, as if the gentlemen could not so much as keep their own wickedness
to themselves, without the like of him going to hell in their very company, and by the same
road. I have as much a mind as ever I had to my dinner, to go back and tell him to sort his
horse himself, since he is as able as I am."

"Hout tout, man!" answered Jasper, "keep a calm sough; better to fleech a fool than fight with
him."

Martin acknowledged the truth of the proverb, and, much comforted therewith, betook himself
to cleaning the stranger's horse with great assiduity, remarking, it was a pleasure to handle
a handsome nag, and turned over the other to the charge of Jasper. (29), "her had small."

about to spread for us, that the vassal of the kirk is seldom found with her basket bare."
To Mary Avenel, Christie presented the stranger, after the best fashion he could, as to the
niece of his master the baron.

While he thus laboured to reconcile Sir Piercie Shafton to his fate, the widow, having consulted
her son Edward on the real import of the Lord Abbot's injunction, and having found that Christie
had given a true exposition, saw nothing else left for her but to make that fate as easy as
she could to the stranger. He himself also seemed reconciled to his lot by some feeling probably
of strong necessity, and accepted with a good grace the hospitality which the dame offered
with a very indifferent one.

In fact, the dinner, which soon smoked before the assembled guests, was of that substantial
kind which warrants plenty and comfort. Dame Glendinning had cooked it after her best manner;
and, delighted with the handsome appearance which her good cheer made when placed on the table,
forgot both her plans and the vexations which interrupted them, in the hospitable duty of pressing
her assembled visiters to eat and drink, watching every trencher as it waxed empty, and loading
it with fresh supplies ere the guest could utter a negative.

In the meanwhile, the company attentively regarded each other's motions, and seemed endeavouring
to form a judgment of each other's character.  Sir Piercie Shafton condescended to speak to
no one but to Mary Avenel, and on her he conferred exactly the same familiar and compassionate,
though somewhat scornful sort of attention, which a pretty fellow of these days will sometimes
condescend to bestow on a country miss, when there is no prettier or more fashionable woman
present. The manner indeed was different, for the etiquette of those times did not permit Sir
Piercie Shafton to pick his teeth, or to yawn, or to gabble like the beggar whose tongue (as
he says) was cut out by the Turks, or to affect deafness or blindness, or any other infirmity
of the organs. But though the embroidery of his conversation was different, the groundwork
was the same, and the high-flown and ornate compliments with which the gallant knight of the
sixteenth century inter-larded his conversation, were as much the offspring of egotism and
self-conceit, as the jargon of the coxcombs of our own days.

The English knight was, however, something daunted at finding that Mary Avenel listened with
an air of indifference, and answered with wonderful brevity, to all the fine things which ought,
as he conceived, to have dazzled her with their brilliancy, and puzzled her by their obscurity.
But if he was disappointed in making the desired, or rather the expected impression, upon her
whom he addressed, Sir Piercie Shafton's discourse was marvellous in the ears of Mysie the
Miller's daughter, and not the less so that she did not comprehend the meaning of a single
word which he uttered. Indeed, the gallant knight's language was far too courtly to be understood
by persons of much greater acuteness than Mysie's.

It was about this period, that the "only rare poet of his time, the witty, comical, facetiously-quick,
and quickly-facetious, John Lylly--he that sate at Apollo's table, and to whom Phoebus gave
a wreath of his own bays without snatching" [Footnote: Such, and yet more extravagant, are
the compliments paid to this author by his editor, Blount. Notwithstanding all exaggeration,
Lylly was really a man of wit and imagination, though both were deformed by the most unnatural
affectation that ever disgraced a printed page.]--he, in short, who wrote that singularly coxcomical
work, called Euphues and his England, was in the very zenith of his absurdity and his reputation.
The quaint, forced, and unnatural style which he introduced by his "Anatomy of Wit," had a
fashion as rapid as it was momentary--all the court ladies were his scholars, and to parler
Euphuisme, was as necessary a qualification to a courtly gallant, as those of understanding
how to use his rapier, or to dance a measure.

It was no wonder that the Maid of the Mill was soon as effectually blinded by the intricacies
of this erudite and courtly style of conversation, as she had ever been by the dust of her
father's own meal-sacks. But there she sate with her mouth and eyes as open as the mill-door
and the two windows, showing teeth as white as her father's bolted flour, and endeavouring
to secure a word or two for her own future use out of the pearls of rhetoric which Sir Piercie
Shafton scattered around him with such bounteous profusion.

For the male part of the company, Edward felt ashamed of his own manner and slowness of speech,
when he observed the handsome young courtier, with an ease and volubility of which he had no
conception, run over all the commonplace topics of high-flown gallantry. It is true the good
sense and natural taste of young Glendinning soon informed him that the gallant cavalier was
speaking nonsense. But, alas! where is the man of modest merit, and real talent, who has not
suffered from being outshone in conversation and outstripped in the race of life, by men of
less reserve, and of qualities more showy, though less substantial? and well constituted must
the mind be, that can yield up the prize without envy to competitors more worthy than himself.

Edward Glendinning had no such philosophy. While he despised the jargon of the gay cavalier,
he envied the facility with which he could run on, as well as the courtly tone and expression,
and the perfect ease and elegance with which he offered all the little acts of politeness to
which the duties of the table gave opportunity. And if I am to speak truth, I must own that
he envied those qualities the more as they were all exercised in Mary Avenel's service, and,
although only so far accepted as they could not be refused, intimated a wish on the stranger's
part to place himself in her good graces, as the only person in the room to whom he thought
it worth while to recommend himself. His title, rank, and very handsome figure, together with
some sparks of wit and spirit which flashed across the cloud of nonsense which he uttered,
rendered him, as the words of the old song say, "a lad for a lady's viewing;" so that poor
Edward, with all his real worth and acquired knowledge, in his home-spun doublet, blue cap,
and deerskin trowsers, looked like a clown beside the courtier, and, feeling the full inferiority,
nourished no good-will to him by whom he was eclipsed.

Christie, on the other hand, as soon as he had satisfied to the full a commodious appetite,
by means of which persons of his profession could, like the wolf and eagle, gorge themselves
with as much food at one meal as might serve them for several days, began also to feel himself
more in the back-ground than he liked to be. This worthy had, amongst his other good qualities,
an excellent opinion of himself; and, being of a bold and forward disposition, had no mind
to be thrown into the shade by any one. With an impudent familiarity which such persons mistake
for graceful ease, he broke in upon the knight's finest speeches with as little remorse as
he would have driven the point of his lance through a laced doublet.  Sir Piercie Shafton,
a man of rank and high birth, by no means encouraged or endured this familiarity, and requited
the intruder either with total neglect, or such laconic replies as intimated a sovereign contempt
for the rude spearman, who affected to converse with him upon terms of equality. 

That was the first and lyrical I who have either endured a bird indulging its requited whim while
it sat on nest. It who continued its solo who rank him at few minutes i stopped for watch, glancing
over the spearman to nest of its auditor with a gleam upon its twinkling
eyes.

A little specimen of the conversation may not be out of place, were it but to show young ladies
what fine things they have lost by living when Euphuism is out of fashion.

"Credit me, fairest lady," said the knight, "that such is the cunning of our English courtiers,
of the hodiernal strain, that, as they have infinitely refined upon the plain and rusticial
discourse of our fathers, which, as I may say, more beseemed the mouths of country roisterers
in a May-game than that of courtly gallants in a galliard, so I hold it ineffably and unutterably
impossible, that those who may succeed us in that garden of wit and courtesy shall alter or
amend it. Venus delighted but in the language of Mercury, Bucephalus will stoop to no one but
Alexander, none can sound Apollo's pipe but Orpheus."

"Valiant sir," said Mary, who could scarcely help laughing, "we have but to rejoice in the
chance which hath honoured this solitude with a glimpse of the sun of courtesy, though it rather
blinds than enlightens us."

"Pretty and quaint, fairest lady," answered the Euphuist. "Ah, that I had with me my Anatomy
of Wit--that all-to-be-unparalleled volume--that quintessence of human wit--that treasury of
quaint invention--that exquisitively-pleasant-to-read, and inevitably-necessary-to-be-remembered
manual, of all that is worthy to be known--which indoctrines the rude in civility, the dull
in intellectuality, the heavy in jocosity, the blunt in gentility, the vulgar in nobility,
and all of them in that unutterable perfection, of human utterance, that eloquence which no
other eloquence is sufficient to praise, that art which, when we call it by its own name of
Euphuism, we bestow on it its richest panegyric."

"By Saint Mary," said Christie of the Clinthill, "if your worship had told me that you had
left such stores of wealth as you talk of at Prudhoe Castle, Long Dickie and I would have had
them off with us if man and horse could have carried them; but you told us of no treasure I
wot of, save the silver tongs for turning up your mustachoes."

The knight treated this intruder's mistake--for certainly Christie had no idea that all these
epithets which sounded so rich and splendid, were lavished upon a small quarto volume--with
a stare, and then turning again to Mary Avenel, the only person whom he thought worthy to address,
he proceeded in his strain of high-flown oratory, "Even thus," said he, "do hogs contemn the
splendour of Oriental pearls; even thus are the delicacies of a choice repast in vain offered
to the long-eared grazer of the common, who turneth from them to devour a thistle. The fowl were
most remote ablutions in the protoplasm of the dale, keep southerly
