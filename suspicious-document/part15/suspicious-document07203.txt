"Bliss my hert, Bawbie," says Sandy, gettin' akinda peppery, "shurely to peace a scone's bigger
than a bit o' a scone."

"There's nae doot aboot that," says I, "if the scone that you have a bit o' is nae bigger gin
the scone that's bigger gin the bit o' the ither ane."

"That's teen for grantit, of coorse," says Sandy.

"But I dinna see hoo that mak's ony difference to the back door o' the cairt," says I, I says.

Sandy took a gey wild-like bite at his row, an gae twa-three o' his chuck-chucks, an' then
he says, "Man, Bawbie, you weemin fowk have nae rizzenin' faculty.  Naebody wi' ony logic wud
need twa looks to see brawly that onything's bigger than a bit o't, or, as the book says, that
the whole's greater than its pairt.  That's self-evident.  Tak' the Toon Cooncil, say.  It's
shurely bigger than ony ane o' the Cooncillers."

"Is't na?" I brook in gey quick.  "Juist you speer at Bailie Thingymabob, an' you'll shune
find oot whuther he thinks the Toon Cooncil or him the biggest o' the twa."

"Auch, Bawbie; you're no wirth argeyin' wi'," says Sandy.  "You've aye sic a desjeskit wey
o' lookin' at things.  What's the sense o' bletherin' aboot Bailie Thingymabob?  Preserve me!
if he's only an echteent pairt o' the Toon Cooncil, shurely common sense 'ill lat you see that
the Toon Cooncil's bigger than he is.  Ony bit loonie in the tower-penny cud see that in a blink."

"Very weel," says I; "juist speer at Bailie Thingymabob himsel'.  I'll swag, if you tell him
he's only an echteent pairt o' the Toon Cooncil, he'll be dealin' wi' anither tattie man gin
neist mornin'.  Sandy, loonikie, your exyems may do amon' your triangles an' sic like fyke-facks
an' kyowows, but they're a' blethers you see brawly ony ither wey."

What a raise Sandy got intil!  He was that kankered that he took twa or three ill-natured rives
o' a shreed o' breed, an' a gullar o' tea, an' fair stankit himsel'.  It gaed doon the wrang
road, an' Sandy was nearhand chokit.

"Sairs me richt for argey-bargeyin' wi' a doited cratur that canna see a thing that's as plen's
a pikestaff," he says, efter he had gotten his nose blawn.  Syne he cowshined doon a bittie,
an' says, wi' a bit snicker o' a lauch, "I maun hae you tried wi' the pond's ass anowerim."

"An wha micht he be?" says I.

"That's the fift proposition, Bawbie," says Sandy.  "It's ca'ed the pond's ass anowerim.  That's
Latin for the cuddy's brig.  If you canna get ower't, you're set down for an ass."

"Have you been ower't, Sandy?" I says, says I.

"No' yet," he says, never lattin' wink that he noticed the dab I had at him; "but I'm beginnin'
to see throo't, I think.  Gin I had anither glisk or twa at her I'll be on the richt side o'
her, I'se wadger."

Fient a glint o' sense cud I see in Sandy's palaver; so I says, says I--"What is this fift
proposition you're haiverin' aboot?"

"Weel, it's juist this," says Sandy; an' he began to mak' a lot o' fairlies wi' his finger
amon' the floor aff the rows on the table. "Look sae, there's what ye ca' a soshilist triangle.
Weel, you see the twa corners at the doon end o' her hare?  They're juist the very marrows
o' ane anither; an' if you cairry the lines at the side o' them here a bit farrer doon, an'
get in ablo the boddam o' the triangle, ye'll find that the corners aneth the boddam are juist
the very marrows o' ane anither too.  D'ye see?"

"Ay, Sandy," I says, says I, "you'll better awa' an get Donal' yokit. I dinna ken what use
thae soshilist triangles an' ither feelimageeries like hen's taes are genna be to you, but
I howp they'll no' be learnin' ye to gie fowk jimp wecht, or it'll juist be the ruin o' your
trade. I've nae objections to you haein' a hobby; but shurely you cud get a better ane gin
a lot o' thae blethers o' Bandy Wobster's.  Get ane o' thae snap-traps, or whativer ye ca'
them, for takin' photographs; get on for the fire brigade or the lifeboat, join the Rifles
or something. There wud be some sense in the like o' that.  But fykin' an' scutterin' awa'
amon' exyems, as you ca' them, an' triangles, an' a puckle things like laddies' girds and draigons,
that nae livin' sowl cud mak' ether eechie or ochie o'----Feech!  I wudna be dodled wi' them;
juist a lot o' laddie-paddie buff."

Sandy jamp aff his seat an', rammin' on his hat, gaed bang throo the shop, yatterin', "Auch,
haud your gab; that claikin' tongue o' yours mak's me fair mauchtless.  I micht as weel argey
wi' the brute beast i' the swine-crue till I was black i' the face."  An' oot at the door he
gaed, halin't to ahent him wi' a bang that garred the very sweetie bottles rattle.

VII.

SANDY'S MAGIC LANTERN EXHIBITION.

I was juist gaen oot at the back door on Wednesday nicht last week when I hears some crackin'
gaen on i' the washin'-hoose, an' I lookit in to see wha was there.

"Man, that's juist the very dollop," says Sandy, as I lifted the sneck.

Dauvid Kenawee an' Bandy Wobster an' him were stravagin' roond aboot the place wi' a fitrool
an' a bawbee can'le, an' I saw immidintly that there was something i' the wind.  I was juist
clearin' my throat to lat them ken there was to be nae mair o' their conspiracies in my washin'-hoose,
when Dauvid slippit in his wird afore me.

"Come awa, Bawbie," he saya, says he, in his uswal quiet wey.  "We were juist seein' aboot
whuther we micht hae a bit magic lantern exhibition here on Setarday nicht.  I have a class
at the Mission Sabbath Schule, ye see, an' I was genna hae them at a cup o' tea on Setarday,
an' I thocht o' gien them a bit glisk o' the magic lantern.  Robbie Boath, the joiner, has
a lantern he's genna gie's the len' o', an' Sandy here thinks he can wirk the concern a' richt."

"I've nae objection to onything o' that kind, whaur gude's genna be done," says I.  "But it's
no' nane o' your electric oxey hydropathic kind o' bisnesses, is't?  I winna lippen Sandy wi'
onything o' that kind, for I tell ye----"

"Dinna you bather yoursel, Bawbie," brook in Sandy.  "This is a parafin lantern; juist as easy
wrocht as your washin' machine there."

"Ay weel, Sandy," says I, "gin ye get on wi' your magic lantern as weel's ye generally manish
wi' the washin' machine, when I'm needin' a hand o' ye, I'll swag Dauvid's bairns 'ill no'
be lang keepit."

"Tach, Bawbie, you're aye takin' fowk aff wi' your impidence," says Sandy, gey ill-natured like.

But Dauvid an' Bandy juist took a bit lauch at him.

Weel, than, to mak' a lang story short, Setarday nicht cam', and the magic lantern wi't.  Dod,
but Sandy had a gey efternune o't.  He was steerin' aboot, carryin' in soap boxes for seats
to the bairns, an' learnin' up his leed aboot the pictures, an' orderin' aboot Nathan; ye never
heard the like!  I heard him yatterin' awa' till himsel' i' the back shop, "The great battle
o' Waterloo was fochen in echteen fifteen atween the English an' the French, an' Bloocher landit
on the scene juist as Wellinton was gien the order--Tuts, ye stupid blockheid, Nathan, that
saft-soap barrel disna gae there--'Up gairds an' at them.'"  He gaed on like this for the feck
o' the efternune, an' even in the middle o' his tea, when I speered if it was het eneuch, he
lookit at me akinda ravelled like, and says, "Although ye was startin' for that star the day
you was born, stride-legs on a cannon ball, ye wudna be there till ye was mair than ninety
'ear auld."

"Wha's speakin' aboot stars?" says I; "I'm speerin' if your tea's het eneuch?"

"O, ay, yea, I daursay; it's a' richt," says Sandy.  "I was mindin' aboot Sirias, the nearest
fixed star, ye ken.  I winder what it's fixed wi'?"

Seven o'clock cam' roond, an' Dauvid's bairns gaed throo oor entry like's they'd startit for
Sandy's fixed star.  They wudda gane through the washin'-hoose door if it hadna happened to
be open.  I had forgotten aboot them at the time; but, keep me, when they cam' oot o' Dauvid's
efter their tea, I floo to the door.  I thocht it was somebody run ower.

Sandy had on his sirtoo an' his lum gin this time, an' he was gaen about makin' a terriple
noise, blawin' his nose in his Sabbath hankie, an' lookin', haud your tongue, juist as big's
bull beef.  He gaed into the washin'-hoose to cowshin the laddies, for they were makin' a terriple
din.

"Now, boys an' loons--an' lassies, I mean," says Sandy, "there must be total nae noise ava,
or the magic lantern 'ill no wirk."

"Hooreh!  Time's up!" roared a' the laddies thegither; an' they whistled, an' kickit wi' their
feet till you wudda thocht they wud haen my gude soap boxes ca'd a' to crockineeshin.

Dauvid appeared to tak' the whole thing as a maitter o' coorse, an' when I speered if this
was juist their uswal, "Tuts ay," says he, "it's juist the loons in the exoobrians o' their
speerits, d'ye know, d'ye see."

Thinks I to mysel', thinks I, I wud tak' some o' that exoobrians oot o' them, gin I had a fortnicht
o' them.  A Sabbath class!  It was mair like a half-timers' fitba' club.  But, of coorse, it's
no' ilka day they see a magic lantern.

Mistress Kenawee, an' Mistress Mollison an' her man, the Gairner, an' the Smith, an' I cudna
tell ye hoo mony mair, had gotten wind o't, an' the washin'-hoose was as foo as cud cram. 
There was a terriple atramush amon' the laddies when the can'le was blawn oot, an' syne Sandy
strak a spunk an' lichtit his lantern, an', efter a fell lot o' fykin', he got her into order.

Sandy gae a keckle o' a host, an' syne he says, "Now, boys an' girls an' people, the first
picture I'm genna show you is Danyil in the den o' lions.  There he is sae!" an' he shot in
the picture.

It was an awfu' queer-like picture.  I cud nether mak' heid nor tail o't.  It was a' juist
akinda greenichy-yallichy like, like's somebody had skelt a pottal o' green-kail or something
on the sheet whaur the picture was.

"I'm dootin' there's something wrang wi' the fokis," says Bandy Wobster.

"Juist you look efter your ain fokis, Bandy," says Sandy, gey peppery weys, "an' lat ither
fowk's fokises aleen."

"Are ye share you're richt wi' the picture?" Dauvid Kenawee speered.

"There's naething wrang wi' the picture," says Sandy.  "Ye see that kind o' a broon bit doon
at the fit there?  That's ane o' Danyil's feet."

"Look the number o' the slide, Sandy," said Bandy, "an' mak' shure you're richt.  They're mibby
oot o' order."

"You're oot o' order," said Sandy, as angry as a wasp.  "Haud that lum hat, Bawbie!" he says;
an' he oot wi' the picture, an' roars oot--"Number 2217!  Look up 2217, Nathan, i' the book
there, an' see what it says."

Efter kirnin' aboot amon' the leaves o' his book for a meenit or twa, Nathan got up his nose
to the moo o' the lantern an' read oot--"A slice o' a drunkard's liver."

"What d'ye say?" says Sandy.  "Lat's see't."

"A slice o' a drunkard's liver," says Nathan again.

Sandy grippit the book, an' efter a meenit, he says, "Ay, man; so you're richt.  There's been
some mixin' amon' the pictures.  This is a slice or section o' a drunkard's liver," he continued,
"showin' the effeks o' alcohol."

The laddies hurraed the drunkard's liver like onything, an' this gae Sandy time to get his
breath, an' to dicht the sweit aff his face.

"That's the kind o' a liver ye'll get if you're drunkards," said Sandy. "The action o' the
alcohol dejinerates the tishie until the liver becomes akwilly ransed, an' the neebriate becomes
a total wreck."  At this the laddies an' lassies clappit their hands like a' that.

"See that ye never get a drunkard's liver," said Sandy in a solemn voice; an' ane o' Dauvid's
laddies says, "By golly, I wudna like a sowser o' a liver like that, onywey," an' set a' the
rest a-lauchin'.

"Attention!" shouted Dauvid till his class; an' Bandy Wobster--wha was busy glowerin' at the
drunkard's liver, an' windrin' what like his ain was, nae doot--strak in, without kennin',
wi' "Shoulder arms!" an' the laddies roared an' leuch till you wud actually thocht they wudda
wranged themsel's.  Gin they stoppit, Sandy had fa'in' in wi' Danyil, an' there he was, glowerin'
at's a', life-size, an' twenty lions wirrin' a' roond aboot him.

Sandy tell'd the story aboot Danyil, an' hoo he was flung in amon' the lions for no' bein'
a vegabon'; an' faigs, mind ye.  Sandy got on winderfu'.  The laddies paid fine attention,
an' ye cudda heard a preen fa'in' when Sandy was speakin'.

"There's no' nae lions' dens nooadays, ye see," say Sandy, to feenish up wi'.  "What is't they
do wi' creeminals or notorious fowk noo?"

"Pet them on for Toon Cooncillers," said ane o' the biggest o' Dauvid's laddies; an' Bandy
Wobster lut oot a great ballach o' a lauch, an' roared at the pitch o' his voice--"Confoond
it!  Feech!  I've swallowed a bit tobacco!"

Then there were pictures o' Joseph an' Moses, an' a great lot mair Bible characters, the loons
roarin' oot the names generally afore the pictures were half in sicht.  They were roid loons,
an' nae mistak', but I can tell ye they had the Bible at their finger nebs.  Dauvid was as
prood's Loocifer aboot the laddies answerin' so smert; but Sandy hardly liked it.

They had a' the Bible stories as dare's dare cud be, an' whenever ony picture appeared they
had a' the story roared to ane anither afore Sandy got his fokis putten into order.  Bible
knowledge is a grand thing, nae doot; but the laddies fair took Sandy's job ower his heid;
an' he hardly liked it, as ye'll readily understan'.

But the local characters gae Sandy a better chance, an', I ashure you, he took full advantage
o't.  He gae a lang laberlethan aboot some o' the pictures--keep me, if he'd carried on like
yon at ilky picture, he wudna been dune when the forenune bells wudda been ringin' for the
kirk next day.

"I have noo some kapital pictures o' auld Arbroathians to show you," said Sandy to the bairns
"the reg'lar rale Reed Lichties.  An' I howp the laddies here 'ill tak' a lesson frae them,
an' stick in an' get their pictures in magic lanterns efter they're deid too, an' get great
big mossyleeums--that's thae great muckle sowsers o' gravesteens, juist like mill stalks, ye
ken--oot in the Warddykes Cemetery, wi' their names chiseled on them in gold letters."

The loons riffed an' clappit their hands at this like's they were a' wishin' they were deid
an' buried ablo a big gravesteen.

Efter a lot o' palaver, Sandy shot in his first local picture.

"This is Provost----  What was his name again?  Be was wint to be a great lad at----  Man,
what's his name again, Bandy?" says he.

"I dinna ken, Sandy," said Bandy; "but it strik's me you have him into the lantern upside doon.
He's stanin' on his heid."

"He was a gey upside-doon character, at ony rate," said the Smith.  "He was juist aboot as
muckle use the tae wey as the tither."

Sandy got his Provost putten richt; but some o' the rest o' his notables were juist as pranky.
They cam' in backside-foremost, upside-doon, lying alang the floor--ye never saw the like--until
Sandy was near-hand at the swearin'.  "Confoond thae Provosts and Bailies," says he, "I never
saw sic a set."

"Ow, ow, Sandy," says I, "ye needna get angry at thae bodies; they're a' deid."

"Ay weel, we'll hae a whup at some o' the livin' anes," says Sandy. "Gie me up some o' thae
slides in the green box," he cries to Nathan. "Whaur hae ye putten the Provosts an' the Bailies?"

"I have them a' in my breeks' pooch," says Nathan.  "They're a' richt."

"An' whaur's the drunkard's liver?"

"O, I laid it on the boiler-heid, alang wi' Danyil an' some mair."
