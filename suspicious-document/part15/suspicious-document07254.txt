The boy had one very marked trait, which might promise well for the future, or otherwise, according
to circumstances, and that was a certain wilful persistence, which often degenerated into downright
obstinacy. Frequently, when his mother thought that she had coaxed or wheedled him into giving
up something of which she did not approve, he would quietly approach his object in some other
way, and gain his point, or sulk till he did. When he set his heart upon anything he was not
as "unstable as water." While but an indifferent and superficial student, who had habitually
escaped lessons and skipped difficulties, he occasionally became nettled by a perplexing problem
or task, and would work at it with a sort of vindictive, unrelenting earnestness, as if he
were subduing an enemy. Having put his foot on the obstacle, and mastered the difficulty that
piqued him, he would cast the book aside, indifferent to the study or science of which it formed
but a small fraction.

After all, perhaps the best that could be said of him was that he possessed fair abilities,
and was still subject to the good and generous impulses of youth. His traits and tendencies
were, in the main, all wrong; but he had not as yet become confirmed and hardened in them.
Contact with the world, which sooner or later tells a man the truth about himself, however
unwelcome, might dissipate the illusion, gained from his mother's idolatry, that in some indefinite
way he was remarkable in himself, and that he was destined to great things from a vague and
innate superiority, which it had never occurred to him to analyze.

But as the young man approached his majority his growing habits of dissipation became so pronounced
that even his willingly blind mother was compelled to recognize them. "she prevent it beg."

 He saw
that he was "in for it," as he would express himself, and surmised that the less he said the
sooner the ordeal would be over. He therefore took refuge in a silence that was both sullen
and resentful. He was too young and uncurbed to maintain a cold and impassive face, and his
dark eyes occasionally shot vindictive gleams at both his mother and her ally, who had so unexpectedly
caged him against his will. Fortunately the doctor was content, after he had got under way,
to talk at, instead of to, his listener, and thus was saved the mortification of asking questions
of one who would not have answered.

After the last sonorous period had been rounded, the youth arose, bowed stiffly, and withdrew,
but with a heart overflowing with a malicious desire to retaliate. At the angle of the house
stood the clergyman's steady-going mare, and his low, old-fashioned buggy. It was but the work
of a moment to slip part of the shuck of a horse-chestnut, with its sharp spines, under the
collar, so that when the traces drew upon it the spines would be driven into the poor beast's
neck. Then, going down to the main street of the town, through which he knew the doctor must
pass on his way home, he took his post of observation.

CHAPTER II

BOTH APOLOGIZE

Haldane's hopes were realized beyond his anticipations, for the doctor's old mare--at first
surprised and restless from the wounds made by the sharp spines--speedily became indignant
and fractious, and at last, half frantic with pain, started on a gallop down the street, setting
all the town agog with excitement and alarm.

With grim satisfaction Haldane saw the doctor's immaculate silk hat fly into the mud, his wig,
blown comically awry, fall over his eyes, and his spectacles joggle down until they sat astride
the tip of a rather prominent nose.

Having had his revenge he at once relented, and rushing out in advance of some others who were
coming to the rescue, he caught the poor beast, and stopped her so suddenly that the doctor
was nearly precipitated over the dashboard. Then, pretending to examine the harness to see
that nothing was broken, he quietly removed the cause of irritation, and the naturally sedate
beast at once became far more composed than her master, for, as a bystander remarked, the venerable
doctor was "dreadfully shuck up." It was quite in keeping with Haldane's disingenuous nature
to accept the old gentleman's profuse thanks for the rescue. The impulse to carry his mischief
still further was at once acted upon, and he offered to see the doctor safely home.

His services were eagerly accepted, for the poor man was much too unnerved to take the reins
again, though, had he known it, the mare would now have gone to the parsonage quietly, and
of her own accord.

The doctor was gradually righted up and composed. His wig, which had covered his left eye,
was arranged decorously in its proper place, and the gold-rimmed spectacles pressed back so
that the good man could beam mildly and gratefully upon his supposed preserver. The clerical
hat, however, had lost its character beyond recovery, and though its owner was obliged to wear
it home, it must be confessed that it did not at all comport with the doctor's dignity and calling.

Young Haldane took the reins with a great show of solicitude and vigilance, appearing to dread
another display of viciousness from the mare, that was now most sheeplike in her docility;
and thus, with his confiding victim, he jogged along through the crowded street, the object
of general approval and outspoken commendation.

"My dear young friend," began the doctor fervently, "I feel that you have already repaid me
amply for my labors in your behalf."

"Thank you," said Haldane demurely; "I think we are getting even."

"This has been a very mysterious affair," continued the doctor musingly; "surely 'a horse is
a vain thing for safety.' One is almost tempted to believe that demoniacal possession is not
wholly a thing of the past. Once she said she had simply wanted to-- city has once well'shocked as she
