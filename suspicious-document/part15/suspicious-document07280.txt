Jackson was a man of ordinary height, slender, very erect in his carriage, with red hair and
intensely blue eyes. His manners were courteous, affable, and remarkable for a natural dignity
which added greatly to his influence with the people. He was the model from which was grown
that chivalry and nobility of soul and high bearing so characteristic of the people of Southern
Georgia. In truth, the essence of his character seemed subtilly to pervade the entire circle
in which he moved, inspiring a purity of character, a loftiness of honor, which rebuked with
its presence alone everything that was low, little, or dishonest. Subsequently he was elected
Governor of the State, bringing all the qualities of his nature into the administration of
the office; he gave it a dignity and respectability never subsequently degraded, until an unworthy
son of South Carolina, the pus and corruption of unscrupulous party, was foisted into the position.
Strength of will, a ripe judgment, and purity of intention, were the great characteristics
distinguishing him in public life, and these have endeared his name to the people of Georgia,
where now remain many of his descendants, some of whom have filled high positions in the State
and United States, and not one has ever soiled the honor or tarnished the name with an act
unworthy a gentleman.

The Revolutionary struggle called out all the nobler qualities nature has bestowed on man,
in those who conceived the desire and executed the determination to be free. The heroic was
most prominent: woman seemed to forget her feebleness and timidity, and boldly to dare, and
with increased fortitude to bear every danger, every misfortune, with a heroism scarcely compatible
with the delicacy of her nature. To this, or some other inexplicable cause, nature seemed to
resort in preparation for coming events. In every State there came up men, born during the
war or immediately thereafter, of giant minds--men seemingly destined to form and give direction
to a new Government suited to the genius of the people and to the physical peculiarities of
the country where it was to control the destinies of hundreds of millions of human beings yet
unborn, and where the soil was virgin and unturned, which nature had prepared for their coming.
This required a new order of men. These millions were to be free in the fullest sense of the
word; they were only to be controlled by laws; and the making of these laws was to be their
own work, and nature was responding to the exigencies of man.

The early probation of independent government taught the necessity of national concentration
as to the great features of government, at the same time demonstrating the importance of keeping
the minor powers of government confined to the authority of the States. In the assembling of
a convention for this purpose, which grew out of the free action of the people of each State,
uninfluenced by law or precedent, we see congregated a body of men combining more talent, more
wisdom, and more individuality of character than perhaps was ever aggregated in any other public
body ever assembled. From this convention of sages emanated the Constitution of the United
States; and most of those constituting this body reassembled in the first Congress, which sat
as the supreme power in the United States. It was these men and their coadjutors who inaugurated
and gave direction to the new Government. Under its operations, the human mind and human soul
seemed to expand and to compass a grasp it had scarcely known before. There were universal
content and universal harmony. The laws were everywhere respected, and everywhere enforced.
The freedom of thought, and the liberty of action unrestrained, stimulated an ambition in every
man to discharge his duties faithfully to the Government, and honestly in all social relations.
There was universal security to person and property, because every law-breaker was deemed a
public enemy, and not only received the law's condemnation, but the public scorn. Under such
a Government the rapid accumulation of wealth and population was a natural consequence. The
history of the world furnishes no example comparable with the progress of the United States
to national greatness. The civilized world appeared to feel the influence of her example and
to start anew in the rivalry of greatness. Her soil's surplus products created the means of
a widely extended commerce, and Americans can proudly refer to the eighty years of her existence
as a period showing greater progress in wealth, refinement, the arts and sciences, and human
liberty, than was ever experienced in any two centuries of time within the historical period
of man's existence. My theme expands, and I am departing from the purposes of this work; yet
I cannot forbear the expression of opinion as to the causes of this result. I know I shall
incur the deepest censure from the professors of a mawkish philanthropy, and a hypocritical
religion which is cursing with its cant the very sources of this unparalleled progress, this
unexampled prosperity.

Slavery was introduced into the Colonies by English merchants about two centuries since: this
was to supply a necessity--labor--for the purpose of developing the resources of this immense
and fertile country. The African was designed by the Creator to subserve this purpose. His
centre of creation was within the tropics, and his physical organization fitted him, and him
alone, for field labor in the tropical and semi-tropical regions of the earth. He endures the
sun's heat without pain or exhaustion in this labor, and yet he has not nor can he acquire
the capacity to direct profitably this labor. It was then the design of the Creator that this
labor should be controlled and directed by a superior intelligence. In the absence of mental
capacity, we find him possessed of equal physical powers with any other race, with an amiability
of temper which submits without resistance to this control. We find him, too, without moral,
social, or political aspirations, contented and happy in the condition of servility to this
superior intelligence, and rising in the scale of humanity to a condition which under any other
circumstances his race had never attained. I may be answered that this labor can be had from
the black as a freeman as well as in the condition of a slave. To this I will simply say, experience
has proved this to be an error. Such is the indolence and unambitious character of the negro
that he will not labor, unless compelled by the apprehension of immediate punishment, to anything
approaching his capacity for labor. His wants are few, they are easily supplied, and when they
are, there is no temptation which will induce him to work. He cares nothing for social position,
and will steal to supply his necessities, and feel no abasement in the legal punishment which
follows his conviction; nor is his social status among his race damaged thereby. As a slave
to the white man, he becomes and has proved an eminently useful being to his kind--in every
other condition, equally conspicuous as a useless one. The fertility of the soil and the productions
of the tropical regions of the earth demonstrate to the thinking mind that these were to be
cultivated and made to produce for the uses and prosperity of the human family. The great staples
of human necessity and human luxury are produced here in the greatest abundance, and the great
majority of these nowhere else. The white man, from his physical organization, cannot perform
in these regions the labor necessary to their production. His centre of creation is in the
temperate zones, and only there can he profitably labor in the earth's cultivation. But his
mental endowments enable him to appropriate all which nature has supplied for the necessities
of life and the progress of his race. He sees and comprehends in nature the designs of her
Creator: these designs he develops, and the consequence is a constant and enlightened progress
of his race, and the subjection of the physical world to this end.

He finds the soil, the climate, the production, and the labor united, and he applies his intelligence
to develop the design of this combination; and the consequence has been the wonderful progress
of the last two centuries. I hold it as a great truth that nature points to her uses and ends;
that to observe these and follow them is to promote the greatest happiness to the human family;
and that wherever these aims are diverted or misdirected, retrogression and human misery are
the consequence. In all matters, experience is a better test than speculation; and to surrender
a great practical utility to a mere theory is great folly. But it has been done, and we abide
the consequences.

In all nations, a spurious, pretentious religion has been the avant-coureur of their destruction.
In their inception and early progress this curse exercises but slight influence, and their
growth is consequently healthy and vigorous. All nations have concealed this cancerous ulcer,
sooner or later to develop for their destruction. These wear out with those they destroy, and
a new or reformed religion is almost always accompanied with new and vigorous developments
in a new and progressive Government. The shackles which have paralyzed the mind, forbidding
its development, are broken; the unnatural superstition ceases to circumscribe and influence
its operations; and thus emancipated, it recovers its elasticity and springs forward toward
the perfection of the Creator. Rescued from these baleful influences, the new organization
is vigorous and rapid in its growth, yielding the beneficent blessings natural to the healthful
and unabused energies of the mind. But with maturity and age the webs of superstition begin
to fasten on the mind; priests become prominent, and as is their wont, the moment they shackle
the mind, they reach out for power, and the chained disciple of their superstition willingly
yields, under the vain delusion that he shares and participates in this power as a holy office
for the propagation of his creed--and retrogression commences.

The effects of African slavery in the United States, upon the condition of both races, was
eminently beneficial to both. In no condition, and under no other circumstances, had the African
made such advances toward civilization: indeed, I doubt if he has not attained in this particular
to the highest point susceptible to his nature. He has increased more rapidly, and his aspirations
have become more elevated, and his happiness more augmented. With his labor directed by the
intelligence of the white race, the prosperity of the world has increased in a ratio superior
to any antecedent period. The production of those staples which form the principal bases of
commerce has increased in a quadruple ratio. Cotton alone increased so rapidly as to render
its price so far below every other article which can be fashioned into cloth, that the clothing
and sheeting of the civilized world was principally fabricated from it. The rapidity of its
increased production was only equalled by the increase of wealth and comfort throughout the
world. It regulates the exchanges almost universally. It gave, in its growth, transportation,
and manufacture, employment to millions, feeding and clothing half of Europe--increasing beyond
example commercial tonnage, and stimulating the invention of labor-saving machinery--giving
a healthy impulse to labor and enterprise in every avocation, and intertwining itself with
every interest, throughout the broad expanse of civilization over the earth. To cotton, more
than to any other one thing, is due the railroad, steamboat, and steamship, the increase of
commerce, the rapid accumulation of fortunes, and consequently the diffusion of intelligence,
learning, and civilization.

Sugar, too, from the same cause, ceased to be a luxury, and became a necessity in the economy
of living: coffee, too, became a stimulating beverage at every meal, instead of a luxury only
to be indulged on rare occasions. How much the increased production of these three articles
added to the commerce and wealth of the world during the last two centuries, and especially
the last, is beyond computation. How much of human comfort and human happiness is now dependent
upon their continued production, and in such abundance as to make them accessible to the means
of all, may well employ the earnest attention of those who feel for the interest and happiness
of their kind most. If these results have followed the institution of African slavery, can
it be inhuman and sinful? Is it not rather an evidence that the Creator so designed?

But this is not all this institution has effected. Besides its pecuniary results, it has inspired
in the superior race a nobility of feeling, resulting from a habit of command and a sense of
independence, which is peculiar to privileged orders of men in civilized society. This feeling
is manifested in high bearing and sensitive honor, a refinement of sentiment and chivalrous
emprise unknown to communities without caste. This is to be seen in the absence of everything
little or mean. A noble hospitality, a scorn of bargaining, and a lofty yet eminently deferential
deportment toward females: in this mould it has cast Southern society, and these traits made
the Southern gentleman remarkable, wherever his presence was found.

These were the men who led in the formation of the Government of the United States, and who
gave tone and character to her legislative assembly, so long as they held control of the Government.
A peer among these was James Jackson, and many of his confederates, of whom I shall have occasion
to speak in the progress of this work.

Among the early immigrants into Georgia were Abraham Baldwin and William H. Crawford. Baldwin
was from Connecticut, Crawford from Virginia. Baldwin was a man of liberal education, and was
destined for the ministry; indeed, he had taken orders, and was an officiating clergyman for
some time in his native state. His family was English, and has given many distinguished men
to the nation. After he arrived in Georgia, where he came to engage in his vocation, he very
soon ascertained his profession was not one which in a new country promised much profit or
distinction; and possessing in an eminent degree that Yankee "cuteness" which is quick to discover
what is to the interest of its possessor, he abandoned the pulpit for the forum, and after
a brief probation in a law office at nights and a school-house by day, he opened an office,
and commenced the practice of law in Augusta. He had been educated a Federalist in politics,
and had not concealed his sentiments in his new home.

Mr. Jefferson and his political principles were extremely popular in Georgia, and though there
were some distinguished Federalists in Augusta who were leaders in her society, their number
in the State was too insignificant to hold out any prospect of preferment to a young, talented,
and ambitious aspirant for political distinction. Baldwin was not slow to discover this, and,
with the facile nature of his race, abandoned his political creed, as he had his professional
pursuits. He saw Crawford was rising into public notice, and he knew his ability, and with
characteristic impudence he thrust himself forward, and very soon was made a member of Congress.
Here he was true to his last love, and became a leading member of the Republican party. By
his conduct in this matter he made himself odious to his New England friends, who were unsparing
of their abuse because of his treachery.

For this he cared very little; but bore well in mind that "the blood of the martyrs was the
seed of the church," and that the hate of the Federalists was the passport to Republican favor.
His zeal was that of the new convert, and it won for him the confidence of his party, and rapid
preferment in the line of distinction. He was a man of decided abilities, and seemed destined
to high distinction; but dying early, a member of the United States Senate, his hopes and aspirations
here terminated. The State has honored and perpetuated his name by giving it to the county
wherein is situated her seat of government.

Crawford, like Baldwin, taught, and studied law at the same time. He was usher in a school
taught by his life-long friend, Judge Yates. When admitted to practise law, he located in the
little village of Lexington, in the County of Oglethorpe, and very soon was not only the leading
lawyer, but the leading man of all the up-country of Georgia.

Eminence is always envied: this was conspicuously the fortune of Crawford. The population of
the State was increasing rapidly, and young aspirants for fame and fortune were crowding to
where these were promised most speedily.

The Yazoo question had created deep animosities. General Elijah Clarke, and his son John, subsequently
governor of the State, were charged with complicity in this great fraud. The father had distinguished
himself in repelling the Indians in their various forays upon the frontiers, and was a representative
man. With strong will and distinguished courage, he, without much talent, was conspicuous among
a people who were, like himself, rude, unlettered, but daring, and abounding in strong common-sense.

There was a young man at the same time, a devoted friend of young Clarke, and follower of his
father: he was an emigrant from one of the Middle States. Violent in his character, and incautious
in the use of language, he very soon became offensive to his opponents, and sought every opportunity
to increase the bad feeling with which he was regarded. Siding with the Yazoo Company, he soon
made himself odious to their enemies. The parties of Republicans and Federalists were bitter
toward each other, and feuds were leading to fights, and some of these of most deadly character.
The conflicts with the Indians had kept alive the warlike spirit which the partisan warfare
of the Revolution had cultivated at the South, and no virtue was so especially regarded by
these people as that of personal courage. The consequence was that no man, whatever his deportment
or qualifications, could long fill the public eye without distinguishing himself for the possession
of personal bravery.

The Clarkes were the undisputed leaders of public opinion in the up-country, until Crawford
came, and, by his great abilities and remarkable frankness of manner, won away to his support,
and to the support of his opinions, a large majority of the people. This was not to be borne;
and young Van Allen was willingly thrust forward to test the courage of Crawford. Duelling
was the honorable method of settling all difficulties between gentlemen, and Crawford was to
be forced into a duel. If he refused to fight, he was ruined. This, however, he did not do;
and Van Allen was slain in the affair.

This but whetted the rage of the Clarkes, and John Clarke was not long in finding an excuse
to call to the field his hated foe. In this duel Crawford was shot through the left wrist,
which partially disabled that arm for life. But this did not heal the animosity; its rancor
became contagious, and involved the people of the State almost to a man; nor did it end until
both Clarke and Crawford were in the grave.

The history and consequences of this feud, and the two factions which grew out of it, would
be the history of Georgia for more than forty years. Each had an army of followers; and all
the talent of the State was divided between and leading these factions. There were many young
men of decided talent rising into distinction in the professions, who were of necessity absorbed
by these factions, and whose whole subsequent career was tainted with the ignoble prejudices
arising out of this association. Among the most prominent and talented of these was John Forsyth,
Peter Early, George M. Troup, the man sans peur, sans reproche, Thomas W. Cobb, Stephen Upson,
Duncan G. Campbell, the brother-in-law of Clarke, and personally and politically his friend,
and who, from the purity of his character and elevated bearing, was respected, trusted, and
beloved by all who knew him; Freeman Walker, John M. Dooly, Augustus Clayton, Stephen W. Harris,
and Eli S. Sherter, perhaps mentally equal to any son of Georgia.

With the exception of Upson and Troup, these were all natives of the State. Upson was from
Connecticut, and was the son of a button-maker at Watertown, in that State. He was a thorough
Yankee in all the qualities of perseverance, making and saving money. He was a pure man, stern
and talented; and as a lawyer, was scarcely equalled in the State. He and Cobb were students,
and protégés of Crawford, and both signalized their whole lives by a devotion, amounting almost
to fanaticism, to Mr. Crawford and his fortunes.

George Michael Troup was born at McIntosh's Bluff, on the Tombigbee River, in the State of
Alabama. His father was an Englishman, who, during the Revolution, removed to the place since
called McIntosh's Bluff. Mr. Crawford soon became prominent as a politician, and adopting the
party and principles of Jefferson, was transferred in early life to the councils of the nation.
In the United States Senate he was the compeer of Felix Grundy, John C. Calhoun, Harrison Gray
Otis, Rufus King, Daniel D. Tompkins, William B. Giles, Henry Clay, and many others of less
distinction; and was the especial friend of those remarkable men, Nathaniel Macon and John
Randolph.

At this period, there was an array of talent in Congress never equalled before or since. The
aggressions of English cruisers upon our commerce, and the impressing of our seamen into the
English service, had aroused the whole nation, and especially the South; and the fiery talent
of this section was called by the people, breathing war, into the national councils.

Crawford was in the Senate from Georgia, and was a war-man. John Forsyth, John C. Calhoun,
David R. Williams, George M. Troup, John Randolph, Philip Doddridge, James Barbour, Henry Clay,
and William Lomax from South Carolina, were all comparatively young men.

Lowndes, Calhoun, Clay, and Troup were little more than thirty years of age, and yet they became
prominent leaders of their party, exercising a controlling influence over the public mind,
and shaping the policy of the Government. Crawford was the Mentor of this ardent band of lofty
spirits--stimulating and checking, as occasion might require, the energies and actions of his
young compeers. So conspicuous was he for talent, wisdom, and statesmanship, that he was proposed
by the Republican party as a proper person to succeed Mr. Madison; and nothing prevented his
receiving the nomination of that party but his refusal to oppose Mr. Monroe. His magnanimity
was his misfortune. Had he been nominated, he would have been elected without opposition. The
golden opportunity returned no more. He had succeeded Chancellor Livingston as minister to
France, and of these two, Napoleon said "the United States had sent him two plenipotentiaries--the
first was deaf, the latter dumb." Livingston was quite deaf, and Crawford could not speak French.
At the court of Versailles, he served faithfully and efficiently the interests of his country,
and returned with increased popularity. He filled, under Mr. Monroe, the office of Secretary
of War for a short time, and then was transferred to the Secretaryship of the Treasury.

In the Cabinet of Mr. Monroe there were three aspirants for the Presidency: Adams, Crawford,
and Calhoun. Between Crawford and Calhoun a feud arose, which was mainly the cause of Mr. Calhoun's
name being withdrawn as a candidate, and the substitution of that of General Jackson. Crawford
was one of the three highest returned to the House, and from whom a choice was to be made.

Some twelve months anterior to the election he was stricken with paralysis; and both body and
mind so much affected that his friends felt that it would be improper to elect him. Nevertheless
he continued a candidate until Mr. Adams was chosen.

Mr. Clay had been voted for as a fourth candidate, but not receiving electoral votes enough,
failed to be returned to the House. Being at the time a member of the House of Representatives,
it was supposed he held the control of the Western vote; and consequently the power to elect
whom he pleased. Mr. Clay was a great admirer of Mr. Crawford, though their intimacy had been
somewhat interrupted by a personal difficulty between Mr. Randolph and Mr. Clay. Mr. Randolph
being an especial friend and constant visitor at Mr. Crawford's, it would have been unpleasant
to both parties to meet at his house.

Only a few years anterior to Mr. Clay's death, and when he was visiting New Orleans, the writer
had frequent interviews with him, and learned that he preferred Mr. Crawford to either Adams
or Jackson; and was only prevented voting for him by the prostration and hopeless condition
of his health.

The political friends of Mr. Clay from the West knew of this preference, and would have acted
with him, only upon condition that Mr. Crawford should make him a member of his Cabinet. This
was communicated to Mr. Clay, who assigned his reasons for declining to vote for Mr. Crawford,
and avowed his intention of giving his vote for Mr. Adams. Upon this announcement, it was urged
upon Mr. Clay that Mr. Adams was uncommitted upon the policy which he had inaugurated as the
American System; that he stood pledged to the country for its success; and that, without some
pledge from Mr. Adams upon this point, he would be hazarding too much to give him his support--for
this would certainly make him President. Mr. Clay's reply was:

"I shall, as a matter of necessity, give my vote for Mr. Adams: Mr. Crawford's health puts
him out of the question, and we are compelled to choose between Adams and Jackson. My opinion
with regard to General Jackson is before the nation, it remains unaltered. I can never give
a vote for any man for so responsible a position whose only claim is military fame. Jackson's
violent temper and unscrupulous character, independent of his want of experience in statesmanship,
would prevent my voting for him. I shall exact no pledge from Mr. Adams, but shall vote for
him, and hold myself at liberty to support or oppose his administration, as it shall meet my
approval or disapproval."

Mr. Adams was elected; and the friends of Mr. Clay insisted that he should accept the position
of Secretary of State in the new Cabinet, which was tendered him by Mr. Adams. Mr. Clay thought
it indelicate to do so. Whether true or not, the nation awarded to him the making of Mr. Adams
President.

General Jackson had received a larger vote in the electoral colleges than Adams, and his friends
urged this as a reason that he was more acceptable to the nation, and the voting for Adams
on the part of Clay and his friends was a palpable disregard of the popular will; and that
Clay had violated all his antecedents, and had thus deserted the principles of the Republican
party.

The friends of Mr. Crawford were silent until the organization of the new Cabinet. There had
been a breach of amicable relations between Crawford and Jackson for some years, and of consequence
between their party friends; and it was supposed from this cause that Mr. Crawford would unite
in the support of the Administration; and when it was known that Clay had accepted the premiership,
this was deemed certain, from the friendship long existing between Clay and himself. The terrible
paralysis which had prostrated Mr. Crawford extended to his mind, and he had ceased to hold
the influence with his friends as controller, and had become the instrument in their hands.

General Jackson received a hint that it would be well to have healed the breach between himself
and Crawford. This it was supposed came from Forsyth, and it is further believed this was prompted
by Van Buren. It may or may not have been so: Mr. Jackson's acuteness rarely required hints
from any one to stimulate or prompt to action its suggestions. All Washington City was astounded,
one Sunday morning, at seeing the carriage of Jackson pull up at the residence of Mr. Crawford;
for their quarrel was known to every one, and it was heralded through the newspapers that a
reconciliation had taken place between these great men. The interview was a protracted one:
what occurred can only be known by subsequent developments in the political world.

Van Buren had supported Crawford to the last extremity, and was greatly respected by him. His
intense acuteness scented the prey afar off. Mr. Calhoun had been elected by the electoral
colleges Vice-President, and this position, it was thought, notwithstanding his devotion to
Jackson, would identify him with the Administration. He was young, talented, extremely popular,
ambitious, and aspiring, and it was the opinion of all that he would urge his claims to the
succession.

The indignation which burst from the Southern and Middle States, and from many of the Western,
at Mr. Clay's course, and the great unpopularity of the name of Adams, was an assurance that
without great changes in public opinion Mr. Adams' administration would be confined to one
term. Mr. Crawford was out of the question for all time, and it was apparent the contest was
to be between Calhoun, Clay, and Jackson.

They had all belonged to the Jeffersonian school of politics--had grown upon the nation's confidence
rapidly through their support of and conducting the war to its glorious termination. But this
party was now completely disrupted; and from its elements new parties were to be formed. It
only survived the dissolution of the Federal party a short time, and, for the want of opposition
from without, discord and dissolution had followed. The political world was completely chaotic--new
interests had arisen. The war had forced New England to manufacturing; it had established the
policy of home production, and home protection; the agricultural interest of the West was connected
with the manufacturing interest of the North, and was to be her consumer; but the planting
interest of the South was deemed antagonistic to them. Her great staple, forming almost the
sole basis of the foreign commerce of the country, demanded, if not free trade, an exceedingly
liberal policy toward those abroad who were her purchasers.

The war had given a new impetus to trade, new channels had been opened, the manufacture of
cotton in England had become a source of wealth to the nation, and was rapidly increasing.
America was her source of supply, and was the great consumer of her fabrics, and this fact
was stimulating the growth of cotton into an activity which indicated its becoming the leading
interest of the South, if not of the nation. The course of trade made it the great competitor
of home manufactures: this would seem unnatural, but it was true--the one demanding protection,
the other free trade. The source of supply of the raw material to both was the same, and America
the great consumer for both. Protection secured the home market to the home manufacturer, compelling
the consumer to pay more, and sell for less, by excluding the foreign manufacturer from the
market, or imposing such burdens, by way of duties, as to compel him to sell at higher prices
than would be a just profit on his labor and skill under the operation of free trade, and which
should exempt from his competition the home manufacturer in the American market.

All these facts were within the purview of the sagacious politicians of the day; and were evidently
the elements of new parties. Mr. Clay had already given shape to his future policy, and had
identified the new Administration with it. It was certain the South with great unanimity would
be in opposition, and the sagacity of Van Buren discovered the necessity of uniting the friends
of Jackson and Crawford. Should he, after feeling the political pulse of his own people, conclude
to unite with the opposition, such a union would destroy Mr. Clay in the South, but might greatly
strengthen Mr. Calhoun; his destruction, however, must be left to the future. He was not long
in determining. The reconciliation of Crawford and-Jackson made the union of their friends
no very difficult matter. Mr. Randolph, Mr. Macon, Mr. Forsyth, and Mr. Cobb had expressed
themselves greatly gratified at this restoration of amity; and at an informal meeting of their
friends, Randolph said, in allusion to this adjustment:

"I have no longer a fear that the seat first graced by Virginia's chosen sons will ever be
disgraced by a renegade child of hers."

Soon after the inauguration of Mr. Adams, and the adjournment of Congress, the nation was startled
with the charge of corruption in the election of Mr. Adams. At first this was vague rumor.
Mr. Clay was charged by the press throughout the country with bargaining with the friends of
Adams, to cast his vote, and carry his influence to his support, upon the condition of his
(Clay's) appointment to the premiership in the Administration, should Adams be elected.

There was no responsible name for this charge; but at the ensuing session of Congress, a member
from Pennsylvania, George Creemer, uttered from his seat the charge in direct terms. This seemed
to give assurance of the truth of this damaging accusation. There was no public denial from
Mr. Clay. The press in his support had from the first treated the story as too ridiculous to
be noticed other than by a flat denial; but the circumstances were sufficiently plausible to
predicate such a slander, and the effect upon Mr. Clay was beginning to be felt seriously by
his friends. In the mean time, rumors reached the popular ear that the proofs of its veracity
were in the hands of General Jackson, whose popularity was running through the country with
the warmth and rapidity of a fire upon the prairies.

There was now a responsible sponsor, and Mr. Clay at once addressed a note to Creemer, demanding
his authority for the charge. This was answered, and General Jackson's was the name given,
as his authority. Mr. Clay sent his friend, General Leslie Combs, with a note to Jackson, with
a copy of Creemer's communication. Combs was a weak, vain man, and so full of the importance
of his mission that he made no secret of his object in visiting Jackson at the Hermitage; and
it was soon running through the country in the party press, each retailing the story as he
had heard it, or as his imagination and party bias desired it. It was soon current that Mr.
Clay had challenged General Jackson, and a duel was soon to occur between these distinguished
men. General Jackson, however, gave as his author, James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania. In turn,
Mr. Buchanan was called upon by Clay, but he denied ever having made any such communication
to General Jackson; at the same time, making certain statements under the seal of secrecy to
Mr. Letcher, Clay's friend. What these revelations were will never be known: death has set
his seal on all who knew them; and no revelation disclosed them in time. Long after this interview
between Letcher and Buchanan, the former called on the latter, and asked to be relieved from
this imputation, and for permission to give to the public these statements; but Mr. Buchanan
peremptorily refused. Mr. Letcher insisted that they were important to the reputation of more
than Mr. Clay: still Buchanan refused; and to this day the question of veracity remains unsettled
between Jackson and Buchanan. The public have, however, long since declared that General Jackson
was too brave a man to lie.

Toward the close of Mr. Clay's life, one Carter Beverly, of Virginia, wrote Mr. Clay some account
of the part he himself had taken in the concoction of this slander, craving his forgiveness.
This letter was received by Mr. Clay while a visitor at the home of the writer, and read to
him: it dissipated all doubts upon the mind of Mr. Clay, if any remained, of the fact of the
whole story being the concoction of Buchanan. Creemer was a colleague of Buchanan, and was
a credulous Pennsylvanian, of Dutch descent; honest enough, but without brains, and only too
willing to be the instrument of his colleague in any dirty work which would subserve his purposes.

Beverly was one of those silly but presumptuous personages who thrust themselves upon the society
of men occupying high positions, and feel their importance only in that reflected by this association;
and ever too fond of being made the medium of slanderous reports, reflecting upon those whose
self-respect and superior dignity has frowned them from their presence. Creemer died without
divulging anything; probably under the influence of Buchanan, and it is not improbable he was
in ignorance of the origin of the slander. Beverly knew of its utter falsity, and was as guilty
as the originator, and his conscience smote him too sorely to permit him to go to the grave
without atonement, and consequently he made a clean breast of it to Mr. Clay.

Mr. Clay and Mr. Buchanan entered public life about the same time, when they were both young
and full of zeal. They belonged to the same political party, and became warmly attached. They
were, however, men of very different temperaments. The professions of Mr. Clay were always
sincere, his love of truth was a most prominent feature in his nature, and his attachments
were never dissimulations: to no other person of his early political friends was he more sincerely
attached than to Buchanan--he was his confidential friend; he was never on any subject reserved
to him; and so deep was this feeling with him that he had called a son after his friend--the
late James Buchanan Clay. When he learned that all his confidences had been misplaced, and
that the man whom he so loved had sought to rob him of his good name, he was wounded to the
heart. He struggled to believe Buchanan was wronged by General Jackson; but one fact after
another was developed--he could not doubt--all pointing the same way; and finally came this
letter of Beverly's, when he was old, and when his heart was crushed by the loss of his son
Henry at Buena Vista, of which event he had only heard the day before: he doubted no more. Entire-intellectual.

 Mr. Calhoun was identified with the popularity of Jackson and
his party, and was now, by common consent of that party, the prominent man for the presidential
succession. Mr. Van Buren had been the Secretary of State of General Jackson, had studied him
well, and knew him well. He knew also the temper of the Democratic party: through his agency
the political morality of New York politicians had permeated the Democracy from one end of
the country to the other: the doctrine subsequently enunciated by Mr. Marcy, that "to the victors
belonged the spoils," was in full operation throughout the nation as the Democratic practice.
This was the cement which closely held the politician to party fealty. Jackson rewarded his
friends, and punished his enemies; Jackson was an omnipotent power; Jackson was the Democratic
party. To secure his friendship was necessary to success; to incur his enmity, certain destruction.
Van Buren was as artful as ambitious: he had indoctrinated Jackson with his own policy, by
inducing him to believe it was his own; and the frankness of Jackson's nature prevented his
believing anything was not what it professed to be. It was the ambition of Van Buren to be
President, and his sagacity taught him the surest means to effect this end was to secure effectually
and beyond peradventure the friendship and support of Jackson. Mr. Calhoun was between him
and the aim of his ambition: to thrust him from Jackson's confidence was to effect all he desired.
This was done; the breach was irreparable. Van Buren was sent, in the interim of the session
of Congress, minister plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James.

Mr. Clay had come back into the Senate, and was heading and leading an opposition, then in
the majority in the Senate; and the nomination of Van Buren was rejected. Jackson, assured
that Calhoun had deceived him, was bitter in his denunciations of him, and Calhoun was sympathizing
with this opposition. Jackson denounced Calhoun as his informant of Crawford being the Cabinet
minister who had in Cabinet council moved his arrest. Calhoun gave the lie direct to the assertion;
and that Jackson was capable of lying, referred as evidence to his statements relative to the
charge of bargain and intrigue against Mr. Clay. But enough had been done to crush out the
popularity and the hopes of Calhoun, beyond the limits of South Carolina. There never has been
so sudden and so terrible a fall from such a height of any man in this nation--not excepting
that of Aaron Burr. John C. Calhoun, in talent, learning, and statesmanship, was greatly superior
to Jackson, and unsurpassed by any man of the age. But the breath of Jackson was the blight
which withered his laurels, and crushed his prospects, and destroyed his usefulness forever,
in a night.

What consequences have grown out of this quarrel, I leave for the pen of the historian. Yet
I cannot forbear the speculation that the late and most disastrous war was one, and of consequence
the ruin and desolation of the South, and the threatened destruction of the Government at this
time. The agitation which led to these terrible consequences, commenced with Mr. Calhoun immediately
subsequent to these events. Does any man suppose, if Mr. Calhoun had succeeded to the Presidency,
that he would have commenced or continued this agitation? For one, I do not. The measure of
his ambition would have been full: his fame would have been a chapter in the history of his
country--his talents employed in the administration of the Government, the honor and boast
of her people, and her preservation and prosperity the enduring monument of his fame and glory.
But, wronged as he believed, disappointed as he knew, he put forth all his strength, and, Samson-like,
pulled down the pillars of her support; and, disunited, crushed, and miserable, she is a melancholy
spectacle to the patriot, and in her desolation a monument of disappointed ambition.

That Mr. Calhoun anticipated any such results, I do not believe. To suppose he desired them,
and to the end of his life labored to produce them, would be to suppose him little less than
a fiend. Blinded by his prejudices and the hatred natural toward those who had accomplished
his political ruin, he could not calmly and dispassionately weigh the influence of his acts
upon the future of his country.

Mr. Crawford was now rapidly declining, his nervous system was completely undermined, and he
felt the approach of death calmly and without fear. Still, he continued to give his attention
to business, and was sufficiently strong to go abroad to calls of duty. In one of these journeys
he stopped to spend the night in the house of a friend, and was found dead in his bed in the
morning, after a quiet and social evening with his friend and family.

William Holt Crawford was a native of Virginia: his family were Scotch, and came early to the
United States, and have been remarkable for their talents and energy. Since the Revolution,
there has scarcely been a time that some one of the family has not been prominently before
the public as a representative man. Mr. Crawford was an eminent type of his race, sternly honest,
of ardent temperament, full of dignity, generous, frank, and brave. Plain and simple in his
habits, disdaining everything like ostentation, or foolish display--strictly moral, firm in
his friendship, and unrelenting in his hatred, his sagacity and sincerity forbade the forming
of the one or the other without abundant cause. He was never known to desert a friend or shrink
from a foe. In form and person he was very imposing; six feet two inches in height; his head
was large, forehead high and broad; his eyes were blue and brilliant, and, when excited, very
piercing. His complexion was fair, and, in early life, ruddy; he was, when young, exceedingly
temperate in his habits, but as he advanced in years he indulged too freely in the luxuries
of the table, and his physicians attributed mainly to this cause his attack of paralysis, which
ultimately destroyed him. His mind had been very much excited during the Presidential canvass;
the attacks of his enemies were fierce and merciless, and very irritating to him; and this
doubtless had much to do with it. He lies buried in the garden of his home, without a stone
to mark the spot. It is a reproach to the people of Georgia that her most eminent son should
be neglected to sleep in an undistinguished grave. But this neglect does not extend alone to
Mr. Crawford. I believe, of all her distinguished men, James A. Meriwether is the only one
whose grave has been honored with a monumental stone by the State. Crawford, Cobb, Dooly, Jackson,
Troup, Forsyth, Campbell, Lumpkin, Dawson, Walker, Colquitt, Berrien, Daugherty, and many others
who have done the State some service and much honor, are distinguished in their graves only
by the green sod which covers them.

The plain republican habits which characterized the people of Upper Georgia, in her early settlement
and growth, together with the fact of the very moderate means of her people, exercised a powerful
influence in the formation of the character of her people. She had no large commercial city,
and her commerce was confined to the simple disposal of the surplus products of her soil and
the supply of the few wants of the people. It was a cardinal virtue to provide every thing
possible of the absolute necessaries of life at home. The provision crop was of first necessity,
and secured the first attention of the farmer; the market crop was ever secondary, and was
only looked to, to supply those necessaries which could not be grown upon the plantation. These
were salt, iron, and steel, first; and then, if there remained unexhausted some of the proceeds
of the crop, a small (always a small) supply of sugar and coffee; and for rare occasions, a
little tea.

The population, with the exception of mechanics, and these were a very small proportion, and
the few professional men and country merchants, was entirely agricultural. This rural pursuit
confined at home and closely to business every one; and popular meetings were confined to religious
gatherings on Sunday in each neighborhood, and the meeting of a few who could spare the time
at court, in the village county-seat, twice a year. There were no places of public resort for
dissipation or amusement; a stern morality was demanded by public opinion of the older members
of society. Example and the switch enforced it with the children. Perhaps in no country or
community was the maxim of good old Solomon more universally practised upon, "Spare the rod
and spoil the child," than in Middle Georgia, fifty years ago. Filial obedience and deference
to age was the first lesson. To lie, or touch what was not his own, was beyond the pale of
pardon, or mercy, and a solitary aberration was a stain for life.

The mothers, clad in homespun, were chaste in thought and action; unlettered and ignorant,
but pure as ether. Their literature confined to the Bible, its maxims directed their conduct,
and were the daily lesson of their children. The hard-shell Baptist was the dominant religion;
with here and there a Presbyterian community, generally characterized by superior education
and intelligence, with a preacher of so much learning as to be an oracle throughout the land.

The Methodists were just then beginning to grow into importance, and their circuit-riders,
now fashionably known as itinerants, were passing and preaching, and establishing societies
to mark their success, through all the rude settlements of the State. These were the pioneers
of that truly democratic sect, as of the stern morality and upright bearing which had so powerful
an influence over the then rising population.

It is more than sixty years since I first listened to a Methodist sermon. It was preached by
a young, spare man, with sallow complexion, and black eyes and hair. I remember the gleam of
his eye, and the deep, startling tones of his voice--his earnest and fervent manner; and only
yesterday, in the Baronne Street (New Orleans) Methodist Church, I listened to an old man,
upward of eighty years of age, preaching the ordination sermon of four new bishops of the Methodist
Church. It was he to whom I had first listened: the eye was still brilliant, the face still
sallow, but wrinkled now, and the voice and manner still fervent and earnest; and the great
mind, though not the same, still powerful. It was that venerable, good man, Lovie Pierce, the
father of the great and eloquent bishop. What has he not seen? what changes, what trials, what
triumphs! Generations before his eyes have passed into eternity; the little handful of Methodist
communicants grown into a mighty and intelligent body; thousands of ministers are heralding
her tenets all over the Protestant world--mighty in learning, mighty in eloquence--yet none
surpass the eloquence, the power, and the purity of Lovie Pierce.

When I first heard him, Bishop Asbury, William Russell, and he were nursing the seed sown by
John Wesley and George Whitefield, a little while before, upon the soil of Georgia. All but
Pierce have long been gathered to their fathers, and have rest from their labors. He still
remains, bearing his cross in triumph, and still preaching the Redeemer to the grandchildren
of those who first welcomed him and united with him in the good work of his mission. How much
his labors have done to form and give tone to the character of the people of the State of Georgia,
none may say; but under his eye and aid has arisen a system of female education, which has
and is working wonders throughout the State. He has seen the ignorant and untaught mothers
rear up virtuous, educated, and accomplished daughters; and, in turn, these rearing daughters
and sons, an ornament and an honor to parents and country. Above all, he has seen and sees
a standard of intelligence, high-breeding, and piety pervading the entire State. The log-cabin
gives way to the comfortable mansion, the broad fields usurping the forest's claim, and the
beautiful church-building pointing its taper spire up to heaven, where stood the rude log-house,
and where first he preached. He has lived on and watched this growing moral and physical beauty,
whose germs he planted, and whose fruits he is now enjoying in the eighty-fourth year of his
age, still zealous, still ardent and eloquent, and a power in the land. Should these lines
ever meet his eye, he will know that the child whose head he stroked as he sat upon his knee--the
youth whom he warned and counselled, loves him yet, now that he is wrinkled, old, and gray.

From parents such as I have described, and under the teaching of such men, grew up the remarkable
men who have shed such lustre upon the State of Georgia.

The great distinguishing feature of these men was that of the masses of her people--stern honesty.
Many families have been and continue to be remarkable for their superior talents and high character;
preserving in a high degree the prestige of names made famous by illustrious ancestry. The
Crawfords, the Cobbs, and the Lamars are perhaps the most remarkable.

Thomas W. Cobb, so long distinguished in the councils of the nation, and as an able and honest
jurist in Georgia, was the son of John Cobb, and grandson of Thomas Cobb, of the County of
Columbia, in the State of Georgia. His grandfather emigrated from Virginia at an early day,
when Georgia was comparatively a wilderness, and selecting this point, located with a large
family, which through his remarkable energy he reared and respectably educated. This was an
achievement, as the facilities for education were so few and difficult as to make it next to
impossible to educate even tolerably the youth of that day. This remarkable man lived to see
his grandson, Thomas W. Cobb, among the most distinguished men of the State. He died at the
great age of one hundred and fifteen years, at the home of his selection, in Columbia County,
the patriarch pioneer of the country, surrounded by every comfort, and a family honoring his
name and perpetuating his virtues; and after he had seen the rude forest give way to the cultivated
field, and the almost as rude population to the cultivated and intellectual people distinguishing
that county.

Thomas W. Cobb, in his education, suffered the penalties imposed in this particular by a new
country; his opportunities, however, were improved to their greatest possible extent, and he
continued to improve in learning to the day of his death. In boyhood he ploughed by day, and
studied his spelling-book and arithmetic by night--lighting his vision to the pursuit of knowledge
by a pine-knot fire. This ambition of learning, with close application, soon distinguished
him above the youth of the neighborhood, and lifted his aspirations to an equal distinction
among the first men of the land. He made known his wishes to his father, and was laughed at;
but he was his grandfather's namesake and pet, and he encouraged his ambition. The consequence
was that young Cobb was sent to the office of William H. Crawford at Lexington, to read law.
He applied himself diligently, and won the respect and confidence of Mr. Crawford, which he
retained to the day of his death. When admitted to the bar, he located with his fellow-student
in Lexington; thus taking the place of Mr. Crawford, who was now in political life. He rose
rapidly in his profession, and while yet a young man was sent to Congress as one of the representatives
of the State.

At this time the representation in Congress was chosen by general ticket. The consequence was
the selection of men of superior talent and character: none could aspire to the high position
whose names had not become familiar for services to the State, or for the display of talent
and character at the bar, or other conspicuous positions, their virtues and attainments distinguishing
them above their fellow-men of the country. Throughout the State, to such men there was great
deference, and the instances were rare where it was not deserved. The discipline and trickery
of party was unknown, nor was it possible that these could exist among a people who, universally,
honestly desired and labored to be represented by their best men. To attain to the high position
of senator or representative in Congress was so distinguishing a mark of merit, that it operated
powerfully upon the ambitious young men of the State, all of whom struggled to attain it by
laboring to deserve it.

The standard of talent established by Crawford, Jackson, and Baldwin was so high, that to have
public opinion institute a comparison between these and an aspirant was a sure passport to
public favor; and this comparison was in no instance so likely to be made as between him and
the pupils of his teaching. This fact in relation to Jackson and Crawford is remembered well
by the writer.

In the low country of Georgia, the fiat of James Jackson fixed the political fate of every
young aspirant. In the up-country, Crawford was as potent. In Crawford's office the student
was required to apply himself diligently, and give promise of abilities, or he could not remain.
The writer remembers to have heard the question asked of Mr. Crawford, in his later days, why
a family in his own county, distinguished for wealth, had uniformly opposed him politically.
In the frankness of his nature he said: "Aleck came, when a young man, to read law in my office,
and though he was diligent enough, he was without the brain necessary to acquire a proper knowledge
of the law. I liked his father, and in reply to an inquiry of his relative, as to Aleck's capacity,
I told him 'his son would doubtless succeed as a farmer, for he was industrious; but he had
not sense enough to make a lawyer.' He thanked me; and Aleck left the office, and, profiting
by my advice, went to the plough, and has made a fortune, and a very respectable position for
himself; but from that day forward, not a member of the family has ever been my friend. I think
I did my duty, and have got along without their friendship."

Jackson had his protégés, and they were always marked for talent. In early life he discerned
the germ of great abilities in two youths of Savannah--George M. Troup and Thomas U.D. Charlton.
Through his influence, these young men, almost as soon as eligible, were sent to the Legislature
of the State, and both immediately took high positions. Talent was not the only requisite to
win and retain the favor of Jackson: the man must be honest, and that honesty of such a character
as placed him above suspicion.

Under the operation of the Confiscation Act, many who had favored the mother country in the
Revolutionary struggle had fled with their property to Florida. Conspicuous among these was
one Campbell Wiley, a man of fortune. This man applied to the Legislature to be specially exempted
from the penalties of this act, and to be permitted to return to the State. A heated debate
ensued, when the bill was being considered, in which Charlton was silent, and in which Troup
made a violent speech in opposition to its passage, ending with the sentence, "If ever I find
it in my heart to forgive an old Tory his sins, I trust my God will never forgive me mine."
This speech gave him an immediate popularity over the entire State. Charlton in secret favored
the bill; but knowing its unpopularity with his constituents, he contrived to be called to
the chair, and was forced to vote on a material motion which was favorable to the bill. The
wealth of Wiley, and Charlton's equivocation, attached suspicion to his motives, and brought
down upon him the wrath of Jackson, blighting all his future aspirations. As a member of the
bar he attained eminence, and all his future life was such as to leave no doubt of his purity,
and the cruel wrong those suspicions, sustained by the frown of Jackson, had done him.

Thomas W. Cobb was eminently social in his nature, and frank to a fault; his opinions were
never concealed of men or measures; and these were, though apparently hasty, the honest convictions
of his judgment, notwithstanding their apparent impulsive and hasty character. Like his tutor,
Mr. Crawford, he cared little for ceremony or show; and in every thing he was the kernel without
the shell: his character was marked before his company in five minutes' conversation, whether
he had ever met or heard of them before; and in all things else he was equally without deceit.
This openness to some seemed rude; and his enemies were of this class. He expressed as freely
his opinion to the person as to the public; but this was always accompanied with a manner which
disrobed it of offence. But human nature will not in every individual excuse the words because
of the manner; and sometimes this peculiarity made him sharp enemies. It will be supposed such
traits would have rendered him unpopular. At this day, when social intercourse is less familiar,
they certainly would have done so; but they seemed a means of great popularity to Cobb, especially
with those who were most intimate with him, as all who met him were, after an hour's acquaintance.
His public life was as his private, open and sincere; he never had a sinister motive, and this
relieved him from duplicity of conduct. His talents were of a high order: in debate, he was
argumentative and explicit; never pretending to any of the arts of the orator; but logically
pursued his subject to a conclusion; never verbose, but always perspicuous. As a lawyer, he
was well read; and the analytical character of his mind appeared to have been formed upon the
model of Judge Blackstone. Before the juries of the country he was all-powerful. These, in
the main, were composed of men of very limited information--and especially of legal lore. But
they were generally men of strong practical sense, with an honest purpose of doing justice
between man and man. Cobb with these was always sincere; never attempting a deception, never
seeking to sway their judgments and secure a verdict by appealing to their passions or their
prejudices, or by deceiving them as to what the law was. Toward a witness or a party of whose
honesty he entertained doubts, he was sarcastically severe; nor was he choice in the use of
terms. As a statesman, he was wise and able--and in politics, as in everything else, honest
and patriotic. In early life he was sent to the House of Representatives, in the Congress of
the United States, and soon distinguished himself as a devoted Republican in politics, and
a warm supporter of the Administration of Mr. Monroe. Here he was reunited socially with Mr.
Crawford and family, and so close was this intimacy that he was on all political measures supposed
to speak the sentiments of Mr. Crawford. Associated with Forsyth, Tatnal, Gilmer, and Cuthbert,
all men of superior abilities, all belonging to the same political party, and all warm supporters,
of Mr. Crawford, he led this galaxy of talent--a constellation in the political firmament unsurpassed
by the representation of any other State. Nor must I forget, in this connection, Joel Crawford
and William Terrell, men of sterling worth and a high order of talent. Mr. Cobb was a man of
active business habits, and was very independent in his circumstances: methodical and correct,
he never left for to-morrow the work of to-day.

He was transferred from the House to the Senate, and left it with a reputation for integrity
and talent--the one as brilliant as the other unstained--which falls to the lot of few who
are so long in public life as he was. Unlike most politicians whose career has been through
exciting political struggles, the blight of slander was never breathed upon his name, and it
descended to his children, as he received it from his ancestry, without spot or blemish.

Toward the close of his life, he was elected by the Legislature of the State to the Bench of
the Superior Court, then the highest judicial tribunal of the State. This was the last public
station he filled. Here he sustained his high character as a lawyer and honest man; carrying
to the tomb the same characteristics of simplicity and sincerity, of affability and social
familiarity, which had ever distinguished him in every position, public or private. He assumed
none of that mock dignity or ascetic reserve in his intercourse with the Bar and the people,
so characteristic of little minds in elevated positions: conscious of rectitude in all things,
he never feared this familiarity would give cause for the charge of improper bias in his decisions
from the bench or his influence with the jury.

Mr. Cobb died at the age of fifty, in the prime of his manhood and usefulness. In person, he
was a model for a sculptor--six feet in height, straight, and admirably proportioned. His head
and face were Grecian; his forehead ample; his nose beautifully chiselled; gray eyes, with
sparkling, playful expression, round, and very beautiful; his head round, large, and admirably
set on; the expression of his features, variant as April weather, but always intellectual,
they invited approach, and the fascination of his conversation chained to his presence all
who approached him. In fine, he was a type in manner and character of the people among whom
he was born and reared; and I scarcely know if this is the greater compliment to him or them.

With few exceptions, this peculiar population of Middle Georgia has furnished all of her distinguished
sons, and to the traits which make them remarkable is she to-day mainly indebted for her exalted
prominence among her sister States of the South. The peculiar training of her sons, the practical
education and social equality which pervades, and ever has, her society, acquaints every one
with the wants of every other; at the same time it affords the facility for union in any public
enterprise which promises the public good. All alike are infused with the same State pride,
and the equality of fortunes prevents the obtrusion of arrogant wealth, demanding control,
from purely selfish motives, in any public measure.

This community of interests superinduces unity of feeling, and unity of action; and the same
homogeneous education secures a healthy public opinion, which, at last, is the great controlling
law of human action. Thus the soil is one, the cultivation is one, the growth is one, and the
fruit is the same. Nowhere in the South have these been so prominent as in Middle Georgia,
and no other portion of the South is so distinguished for progress, talent, and high moral
cultivation. There is, perhaps, wanting that polish of manners, that ease and grace of movement,
and that quiet delicacy of suppressed emotion, so peculiar to her citizens of the seaboard,
which the world calls refinement; which seems taught to conceal the natural under the artistic,
and which so frequently refines away the nobler and more generous emotions of the heart. I
doubt, however, if the habit of open and unrestrained expression of the feelings of our nature
is not a more enduring basis of strong character and vigorous thought and action, than the
cold polish of refined society. Whatever is most natural is most enduring. The person unrestrained
by dress grows into noble and beautiful proportions; the muscles uncramped, develop not only
into beauty, but strength and healthfulness. So with the mind untrammelled by forms and ceremonies;
and so with the soul unfettered by the superstition of vague and ridiculous dogmas. The freedom
of action and familiarity of language, where there are few social restraints to prevent universal
intercourse, familiarizes every class of the community with the peculiarities of each, and
forms an outlet for the wit and humor of the whole. This was the stimulant to mirth and hilarity,
for which no people are so much distinguished as the Georgians of the middle country. At the
especial period of which I now write, her humorists were innumerable. Dooly, Clayton, Prince,
Longstreet, Bacon (the Ned Brace of Longstreet's Georgia Scenes), and many others of lesser
note, will long be remembered in the traditions of the people. These were all men of, eminence,
and in their time filled the first offices of the State. The quiet, quaint humor of Prince
is to be seen in his Militia Muster, in the Georgia Scenes; and there too the inimitable burlesque
of Bacon, in Ned Brace.

John M. Dooly was a native of Lincoln County, Georgia, where he continued to reside until his
death, and where he now lies in an undistinguished grave. He was the son of a distinguished
Revolutionary soldier, whose name, in consideration of his services in that struggle, has been
given to a county in the State. In early life he united himself to the Federal party, and from
honest convictions continued a Federalist in principle through life. But for his political
principles, his name in the nation to-day would have been a household word, familiar as the
proudest upon her scroll of fame. In very early life he gave evidence of extraordinary powers
of mind. With a limited education, he commenced the study of the law when quite young. But
despite this serious defect, which was coupled with poverty and many other disadvantages incident
to a new country impoverished by war, and wanting in almost everything to aid the enterprise
of talent in a learned profession, soon after his admission to the Bar he attracted the attention
of the community, and especially the older members of the Bar, as a man of extraordinary capacity,
and already trained in the law. So tenacious was his memory of all that he read or heard, that
he not only retained the law, but the author and page where it was to be found. His mind was
eminently logical and delighted in analytical investigation. In truth, the law suited the idiosyncrasy
of his mind, and it was most fortunate for his future life, that he adopted it as a lifetime
pursuit. Nature, it seems, gives to every mind a peculiar proclivity, as to every individual
a peculiar mind: to pursue this proclivity is a pleasure; it makes work a delight, and this
secures success. Hence it is fortunate to learn this peculiarity, and to cultivate it from
the beginning. When the mind is strong and vigorous, this peculiar proclivity is generally
well-marked to the inquiring observer in very early life.

It is related of Benjamin West, the great painter, that at five years of age he was continually
soiling the floor of his good and sensible mother with charcoal sketches of the faces of the
different members of the family; and of Napoleon, that in early childhood his favorite amusement
was to build forts and array his playmates into column, and charge these, and assault and enter
them. Stevenson, the great engineer, spent all his idle time, when a boy, in attempts at constructing
machinery and bridges.

In these great minds this natural trait was so strongly marked, and so controlling in its influence,
as to defy and overleap every obstacle, and develop its wonderful energy and capacity in the
most stupendous manner. In such as these, this manifestation is early and palpable. Yet the
same peculiarity exists wherever there is mind sufficient to connect cause and effect; but
it is proportionate with the strength of the mind, and in ordinary or feeble minds it is less
conspicuous, and requires close observation to discern it in early life.

The folly and ambition of parents and adverse circumstances too often disappoint the intentions
of nature, and compel their offspring, or the victims of circumstance, to follow a pursuit
for which they have a natural aversion, and absolutely no capacity: hence we see thousands
struggling painfully through life in a hated avocation, and witness many a miserable lawyer
whom nature designed to be a happy blacksmith. His toil of life is always up hill, without
the possibility of ever attaining the summit. Sometimes the rebellion of nature is successful,
and the misdirected will shake off the erroneously imposed vocation, and dash away in the pursuit
for which the mind is capacitated; and immediate success attests the good sense and propriety
of the act.

Fortunately, John M. Dooly, selected, under the guidance of natural inclination, the profession
of law. His eminence was early in life, and the public eye was directed to him as one worthy
any public trust. He was frequently chosen a member of the Legislature from his native county,
and was distinguished for extraordinary ability in the capacity of a legislator. His conspicuous
position and commanding talents pointed him out as one to take a foremost rank with the first
of the nation; and his friends urged his name as a fit representative in Congress for the State.
At this time the acrimony of party was intense; the Republican, or Jeffersonian party, was
largely in the ascendant in the State, and would accept no compromise. It was willing to receive
new converts and prefer them according to merit, but would accord no favor to an unrepentant
enemy. At this time there were many young, talented men rising to distinction in the State,
who were Federalists. With some of them ambition was superior to principle; they recanted their
principles, and, in the ranks of their former opponents, reaped a harvest of political distinction.
Prominent among these was John Forsyth. He had delivered a Fourth of July oration at Augusta,
distinguished for great ability and high Federal doctrines. Abraham Baldwin, who, with the
astuteness of the Yankee--which he was--had renounced Federalism, and was now a prominent leader
of the Republican party, spoke of this effort of Forsyth as transcendently great, and always,
when doing so, would add: "What a pity such abilities should be lost to the country through
the influence of mistaken political principle!" Whether this had any effect upon the views
of Forsyth or not, certain it is that very soon after he repudiated Federalism, and published
a formal renunciation of the party and its principles. From that time forward his march was
onward, and now his name and fame are embalmed as national wealth.

Dooly was less facile: his convictions were honest and strong, and he clung to them. He won
the confidence not only of his party, but of the people, for high integrity; but this was all.
Out of his county he was intrusted with no political position, and those who most prized his
talents and integrity could never be persuaded to aid in giving these to the country. He was
more than once beaten for the Senate of the United States; and once by Forsyth, who was not
announced as a candidate, and who was at the time minister plenipotentiary of the nation at
the Spanish Court. His great legal abilities were, however, complimented by the Republican
Legislature, by placing him upon the bench of the highest judicial tribunal of the State, where
his usefulness was transcendent, and where most of his life was spent.

As a wit, Dooly never had an equal in the State, and there might now be written a volume of
his social and judicial wit. Its compass was illimitable--from the most refined and delicately
pungent to the coarsest and most vulgarly broad; but always pointed and telling. Nature had
given him a peculiarity of look and voice which gave edge to his wit and point to his humor.

The judicial system of Georgia at this time was peculiar. The State was subdivided into districts,
or circuits, as they were denominated; and one judge appointed to preside over each. These
were elected by the Legislature, on joint ballot, for a term of three years; and until faction
claimed the spoils of victory, the judge who had proven himself capable and honest was rarely
removed, so long as he chose to remain. Dooly was one of these. Party never touched him, and
both factions concurred in retaining him, because it was the universal wish of the people of
his circuit. The law of the country was the common law of England and the statutes of the State.
In the expounding of these, the judges frequently differed, and the consequence was that each
circuit had, in many particulars, its own peculiar law, antagonistic to that which was received
as law in the adjoining circuit. The uniformity of law, so essential to the quiet and harmony
of a people, and so necessary in defining the title and securing the tenure of property, by
this system was so greatly disturbed, that it led to the informal assembling of the judges
at irregular periods, and upon their own responsibility, to reconcile these discrepancies.
This in some degree obviated the necessity of a supreme court for the correction of errors;
but was very unsatisfactory to the Bar, who were almost universal in their desire for the establishment
of a tribunal for this purpose. But there was another feature peculiar to the judicial system
of the State, to which her people were greatly attached: that of special juries. They feared
the creation of a supreme court would abolish this, and for many years resisted it. This system
of special juries, in the organization of her judiciary, was intended to obviate the necessity
of a court of chancery. The conception was a new one, and in Georgia, with her peculiar population,
its effects were admirable. It was an honest, common-sense adjudication of equity cases, and
rendered cheap and speedy justice to litigants. It was unknown in the judiciary system of any
other State, and I will be excused by the reader, who may not be a Georgian, for a brief description
of it here.

By direction of the law of 1798, the justices of the Inferior Court took the tax list, which
contained the name of every white man of twenty-one years and upwards in the county, and, from
this list, selected a certain number of names, and placed them in a box marked "The grand-jury
box." The remaining names were placed in another box marked "The petit-jury box." Those selected
as grand jurors were chosen because of their superior intelligence, wealth, and purity of character.
These selections were made at certain stated periods; and the jurors thus chosen from the mass
never served on the petit jury, nor were they liable even as talesmen to serve on that jury.
The same act made it the duty of the presiding judge of each circuit to draw, at the termination
of each term of his court, and in open court, a certain number of names from each box, which
were entered as drawn upon the minutes of the court, to serve as grand and petit jurors at
the ensuing term of the court. The special juries, for the trial of cases in equity, and appeals
from the verdicts of petit juries, were formed from the grand juries, and after the manner
following: A list was furnished by the clerk of the court to the appellant and respondent.
From this list each had the right to strike a name alternately--the appellant having the first
stroke--until there remained twelve names only. These constituted a special Jury, and the oath
prescribed by law far these jurors was as follows; "You shall well and truly try the issue
between the parties, and a true verdict give, according to law and equity, and the opinion
you entertain of the testimony." Under the pleadings, the entire history of the case went before
this jury, and their verdict was final. It was this method of trial which prevented so long
that great desideratum in all judicial systems--a court for the correction of errors and final
adjudication of cases.

Dishonest litigants feared this special jury. Their characters, as that of their witnesses,
passed in review before this jury, whose oaths allowed a latitude, enabling them frequently
to render a verdict, ostensibly at variance with the testimony, but almost always in aid of
the ends of equitable justice.

The system was eminently promotive of honesty and good morals, as well as the ends of justice;
for men's rights before it were not unfrequently determined by the reputation they bore in
the community in which they lived. This fact stimulated uprightness of conduct, and often deterred
the wrong-doer. It has passed away; but I doubt if what has replaced it has benefited the interests
or morals of the people of the State.

Like Mr. Crawford, Judge Dooly relied more upon the practical good sense of the people as jurors,
for justice between man and man, than upon the technicalities of the law; and especially upon
that of special juries. Dooly had great contempt for petit juries, and evinced it upon one
occasion by declaring in open court that he thought, if there was anything not known to the
prescience of the Almighty, it was what the verdict of a petit jury would be, when they left
the box for the jury-room. Dooly was an opponent of Crawford through life--a friend and intimate
of John Clark, Crawford's greatest enemy. But his character was devoid of that bitterness and
persistent hatred characteristic of these two. Crawford and Judge Tate were intimate friends,
and between these and Clark there was continual strife. Tate and Clark were brothers-in-law;
but this only served to whet and give edge to their animosity. Dooly, in some manner, became
entangled with Tate in this feud; and an amusing story is told of the final settlement of the
difficulty between these men.

Tate, it seems, challenged Dooly to mortal combat. Mr. Crawford was Tate's friend. Dooly, contrary
to all expectation, accepted, and named General Clark as his friend, and appointed a day of
meeting. Tate had lost a leg, and, as was usual in that day, had substituted a wooden, one.
On the appointed day, Tate, with his friend, repaired to the place of meeting, where Dooly
had preceded them, and was alone, sitting upon a stump. Crawford approached him, and asked
for his friend, General Clark.

"He is in the woods, sir."

"And will soon be present, I presume?" asked Crawford.

"Yes; as soon as he can find a gum."

"May I inquire, Colonel Dooly, what use you have for a gum in the matter we have met to settle?"

"I want it to put my leg in, sir. Do you suppose I can afford to risk my leg of flesh and bone
against Tate's wooden one? If I hit his leg, why, he will have another to-morrow, and be pegging
about as well as usual. If he hits mine, I may lose my life by it; but almost certainly my
leg, and be compelled, like Tate, to stump it the balance of my life. I cannot risk this; and
must have a gum to put my leg in: then I am as much wood as he is, and on equal terms with him."

"I understand you, Colonel Dooly; you do not intend to fight."

"Well, really, Mr. Crawford, I thought everybody knew that."

"Very well, sir," said Crawford; "but remember, colonel, your name, in no enviable light, shall
fill a column of a newspaper."

"Mr. Crawford, I assure you," replied Colonel Dooly, "I would rather fill every newspaper in
Georgia than one coffin."

It is scarcely necessary to say, that Tate and Crawford left the field discomfited, and here
the matter ended.

Dooly never pretended to belligerency. When Judge Gresham threatened to chastise him, he coolly
replied he could do it; but that it would be no credit to him, for anybody could do it. And
when he introduced his friend to another as the inferior judge of the Inferior Court of the
inferior County of Lincoln, and was knocked down for the insult, he intreated the bystanders
not to suffer him to be injured. When released from the grasp of his antagonist, he rubbed
his head, and facetiously said: "This is the forty-second fight I have had, and if I ever got
the best of one, I do not now recollect it."

Judge Dooly was much beloved by the younger members of the Bar, to whom he was ever kind and
indulgent, associating with them upon his circuit, and joining in all their amusements. His
wit spared no one, and yet no one was offended at it. His humor was the life of the company
wherever he was, and he was never so burdened with official dignity as to restrain it on the
bench. Unbiassed by party considerations or personal prejudices, and only influenced by a sense
of duty and wish to do right, it was impossible he could be otherwise than popular. This popularity,
however, was personal, not political, and could never secure to him any political distinction.
He was ambitious of a seat in the United States Senate, a distinction to which he more than
once aspired; but here the grinning ghost of Federalism always met him, frightening from his
support even the nearest of his social friends. Mr. Crawford's wishes controlled the State,
through the instrumentality of those he had distinguished with his countenance. Of last. His voiced

This popularity he retained to the end of his life. It elevated him to the Gubernatorial chair,
after serving in the United States Congress and for years upon the bench of the Superior Court.
His talents were not of the first order, but his honesty, sincerity, and goodness made him beloved.

Bartlett was struggling with all his energies to write up the administration and to defend
the Governor against the fierce and reiterated attacks of the opposition. About this period
there appeared some articles in a paper in Augusta, Georgia, reflecting upon Mr. Crawford,
in reply to several papers signed "C.," which were written by Richard H. Wild, then a member
of Congress from Georgia. These articles were attributed to Colonel William Gumming, of Augusta,
and "C.," in reply, attacked him severely. He was not a man to be badgered by an anonymous
writer in a newspaper. He demanded immediately of the editor the name of his correspondent,
and that of George McDuffie, of South Carolina, was given. A challenge ensued--a meeting followed,
in which McDuffie was seriously wounded, and which ultimately caused his death. This affair
increased the hatred between the Georgians and Carolinians, as it did not cease with a single
meeting. Gumming renewed his challenge in consequence of a statement made by McDuffie in a
paper to the public, narrating offensively--as Cumming felt--the particulars of the affair.
A second meeting was the consequence, at which a difficulty arose between the seconds, and
it was adjourned to another day and another place. At this third meeting, in an exchange of
shots, McDuffie's arm was broken, and this terminated the difficulty; but it did not appease
the animosity of the friends of the parties.

These combatants were both men of remarkable abilities. Colonel William Cumming was a native
of Augusta, Georgia. Born to the inheritance of fortune, he received a liberal education and
selected the law as a profession. He read with the celebrated Judges Reeve and Gould, at Litchfield,
Connecticut. At the period of his study this was the only law-school in the United States.
Many anecdotes of his peculiarities during his residence at the school were related by his
preceptors to the young gentlemen from Georgia who followed him in the office in after years.
A moot court was a part of the system of instruction, in which questions of law, propounded
by one of the professors, were argued by students appointed for the purpose. On one occasion,
Cumming was replying to the argument of a competitor, and was so caustic as to be offensive.
This was resented by insulting words. Turning to the gentleman, and without speaking, Cumming
knocked him down. Immediately, and without the slightest appearance of excitement, addressing
the presiding professor, he remarked: "Having thus summarily disposed of the gentleman, I will
proceed to treat his argument in like manner."

Upon his return to Georgia, the war with England having broken out, he procured the commission
of a captain and entered the army. He was transferred to the northern frontier--then the seat
of active operations--and soon distinguished himself amid that immortal band, all of whom now
sleep with their fathers--Miller, Brook, Jessup, McCrea, Appling, Gaines, and Twiggs. Cumming,
Appling, and Twiggs were Georgians. At the battle of Lundy's Lane he was severely wounded and
borne from the field. He was placed in an adjoining room to General Preston, who was also suffering
from a wound. Cumming was a favorite of Preston's, and both were full of prejudice toward the
men of the North. Late at night, Preston was aroused by a boisterous laugh in Cumming's apartment.
Such a laugh was so unusual with him that the general supposed he had become delirious from
pain. He was unable to go to him, but called and inquired the cause of his mirth.

"I can't sleep," was the reply, "and I was thinking over the incidents of the day, and just
remembered that there had not in the conflict been an officer wounded whose home was north
of Mason and Dixon's line. Those fellows know well how to take care of their bacon."

He was soon promoted to a colonelcy, and was fast rising to the next grade when the war terminated.
In the reduction of the army he was retained--a compliment to his merits as a man and an officer.
He was satisfied with this, and, in declining to remain in the army, wrote to the Secretary of War:

"There are many whose services have been greater, and whose merits are superior to mine, who
have no other means of a livelihood. I am independent, and desire some other may be retained
in my stead."

He was unambitious of political distinction, though intensely solicitous to promote that of
his friends. His high qualities of soul and mind endeared him to the people of the State, who
desired and sought every occasion which they deemed worthy of him, to tender him the first
positions within their gift; but upon every one of these he remained firm to his purpose, refusing
always the proffered preferment. Upon one occasion, when written to by a majority of the members
of the Legislature, entreating him to permit them to send him to the Senate of the United States,
he declined, adding: "I am a plain, military man. Should my country, in that capacity, require
my services, I shall be ready to render them; but in no other." He continued to reside in Augusta
in extreme seclusion. Upon the breaking out of the war with Mexico he was tendered, by Mr.
Polk, the command of the army, but declined on account of his age and declining health, deeming
himself physically incapable of encountering the fatigue the position would involve.

The habits of Colonel Cumming were peculiar. His intercourse with his fellow men was confined
to a very few tried friends. He never married, and was rarely known to hold any familiar intercourse
with females. So secluded did he live, that for many years he was a stranger to almost every
one in his native city. He was strictly truthful, punctual to his engagements in business matters,
and honest in all things. In person, he was very commanding. In his walk the whole man was
seen--erect, dignified, and impetuous. Energy and command flashed from his great, gray eyes.
His large head and square chin, with lips compressed, indicated the talent and firmness which
were the great characteristics of his nature. Impatient of folly, he cultivated no intercourse
with silly persons, nor brooked for a moment the forward impertinence of little pretenders.
To those whose qualities of mind and whose habits were congenial to his own, and whom he permitted
familiarly to approach him, he was exceedingly affable, and with such he frequently jested,
and hilariously enjoyed the piquant story in mirthful humor; but this was for the few. He was
a proud man, and was at no pains to conceal his contempt for pert folly or intrusive ignorance,
wherever and in whomsoever he met it.

In early life he was the close intimate of Richard Henry Wild, and was a great admirer of his
genius, and especially his great and interesting conversational powers. Unexceptionable in
his morals, he was severe upon those whose lives were deformed by the petty vices which society
condemns yet practises in so many instances and universally tolerates.

It is greatly to be regretted that the talents and learning of such a man should not be given
to mankind. Every one capable of appreciating these great attributes in man, and who knew Colonel
Cumming, will, with the writer, regret that he persistently refused every persuasion of his
friends to allow them to place him in such a position before the country as would bring his
great qualities prominently forward in the service, and for the benefit of his fellow-men.
His proud nature scorned the petty arts of the politician; and he doubtless felt place could
only be had or retained by the use of these arts; he was of too high principle to descend to
them, and held in great contempt those whose confidence and favor could only be had by chicanery.
He was not a people's man, and had in his nature very little in common with the masses; and,
like Coriolanus, scorned and shunned the great unwashed. He lived out his threescore years
and ten, hiding the jewel God had given him, and appropriating it only to the use of his own
happiness in the solitude he loved.

George McDuffie was a very different man. Born of humble parentage in one of the eastern counties
of Georgia, he enjoyed but few advantages. His early education was limited: a fortuitous circumstance
brought him to the knowledge of Mr. Calhoun, who saw at once in the boy the promise of the
man. Proposing to educate him and fit him for a destiny which he believed an eminent one, he
invited him to his home, and furnished him with the means of accomplishing this end. His ambition
had often whispered to his young mind a proud future, and he commenced the acquisition of the
education which was, as he felt, essential as a means of its attainment. In this he made rapid
progress, and at the age of twenty-five graduated at the university of South Carolina. It was
not long after graduating before he was admitted to the Bar, and commenced the practice of
law in company with Eldridge Simpkins, at Edgefield Court House, who was, if I mistake not,
at the time, a member of Congress.

The rise of McDuffie at the Bar was rapid; he had not practised three years before his position
was by the side of the first minds of the State, and his name in the mouth of every one--the
coming man of the South. It was probably owing to the defence made by him of William Taylor
for the killing of Dr. Cheesboro, that he became famous as it were in a day. This case excited
the people of the whole State of South Carolina. The parties were, so far as position was concerned,
the first in the State. William Taylor was the brother of John Taylor, who at the time of the
killing was Governor of the State. John Taylor, his grandfather, was a distinguished officer
in the army of the Revolution: the family was wealthy, and extensively connected with the first
families of the State. Cheesboro was a young physician of great promise and extensive practice.
Jealousy was the cause of the killing, and was evidently groundless. The deed was done in the
house of Taylor, in the city of Columbia, and was premeditated murder. Mrs. Taylor was a lovely
woman and highly connected. In her manners she was affable and cordial; she was a great favorite
in society, and her universal popularity attracted to her the host of friends who so much admired
her. Dr. Cheesboro was one of these, and the green-eyed monster made him, in the convictions
of Taylor, the especial favorite of his wife. McDuffie was employed in his defence, and he
made a most triumphant success against evidence, law, and justice. His speech to the jury was
most effective. The trial had called to Columbia many persons connected with the family; and
all were interested to save from an ignominious death their relative. This, it was thought,
could only be done by the sacrifice of the wife's reputation. This would not only ruin forever
this estimable lady, but reflect a stain upon her extensive and respectable connections. She
was appealed to, to save her husband's life with the sacrifice of her fame. In the consciousness
of innocence, she refused with Spartan firmness to slander her reputation by staining her conscience
with a lie. Her friends stood by her; and when hope had withered into despair, and the possibility
gone forever of saving him by this means, the eloquence of McDuffie and the influence of family
were invoked, and successfully.

In the examination of the witnesses he showed great tact, and successfully kept from the jury
facts which would have left them no excuse for a verdict of acquittal. But it was in his address
that his great powers made themselves manifest. The opening was impassioned and powerful. Scarcely
had he spoken ten minutes before the Bench, the Bar, the jury, and the audience were in tears,
and, during the entire speech, so entirely did he control the feelings of every one who heard
him, that the sobs from every part of the courtroom were audible above the sounds of his voice.
When he had concluded, the jury went weeping from the box to the room of their deliberations,
and soon returned a verdict of acquittal.

This effort established the fame of McDuffie as an orator and man of great mental powers. Fortunately
at that time it was the pride of South Carolina to call to her service the best talent in all
the public offices, State and national, and with one acclaim the people demanded his services
in Congress. Mr. Simpkins, the incumbent from the Edgefield district, declined a re-election,
that his legal partner, Mr. McDuffie, might succeed him, and he was chosen by acclamation.
He came in at a time when talent abounded in Congress, and when the country was deeply agitated
with the approaching election for President. Almost immediately upon his entering Congress
an altercation occurred upon the floor of the House between him and Mr. Randolph, which resulted
in the discomfiture of Mr. Randolph, causing him to leave the House in a rage, with the determination
to challenge McDuffie. This, however, when he cooled, he declined to do. This rencontre of
wit and bitter words gave rise to an amusing incident during its progress.

Jack Baker, the wag and wit of Virginia, was an auditor in the gallery of the House. Randolph,
as usual, was the assailant, and was very severe. McDuffie replied, and was equally caustic,
and this to the astonishment of every one; for all supposed the young member was annihilated--as
so many before had been by Randolph--and would not reply. His antagonist was completely taken
aback, and evidently felt, with Sir Andrew Ague-cheek: "Had I known he was so cunning of fence,
I had seen him damned ere I had fought him." But he was in for it, and must reply. His rejoinder
was angry, and wanting in his usual biting sarcasm. McDuffie rose to reply, and, pausing, seemed
to hesitate, when Baker from the gallery audibly exclaimed: "Lay on, McDuff, and damned be
he who first cries hold, enough!" The silence which pervaded the chamber was broken by a general
laugh, greatly disconcerting Randolph, but seeming to inspire McDuffie, who went on in a strain
of vituperation witheringly pungent, in the midst of which Mr. Randolph left his seat and the
House. Here was a triumph few had enjoyed. Not even Bayard, in his famous attack upon Randolph,
when the latter first came into Congress, had won so much. Every one seemed delighted. The
newspapers heralded it to the country, and McDuffie had a national reputation. Everything seemed
propitious for his fame, and every friend of Mr. Calhoun felt that he had a champion in his
protégé, who, in good service, would return him fourfold for his noble generosity to the boy.

The contest with Cumming whetted more sharply the edge of the animosity between Georgia and
South Carolina. The two were considered the champions of their respective States, as also the
chosen knights of their respective friends--Crawford and Calhoun. The States and the friends
of the parties in this quarrel very soon arrayed themselves in antagonism, which was made personal
on many occasions, and between many parties. The young were especially prominent in their demonstrations
of hostile feeling, not excepting the belles of the respective States. Between them, I believe,
it never went beyond words; but they were frequent in conflict, and sometimes very bitter and
very witty ones escaped from lovely lips, attesting that the face of beauty was underlaid with
passion's deformity. With the young gallants it went to blows, and, on a few occasions, to
more deadly strife; and always marred the harmony of the association where there were young
representatives of both States. On one occasion of social meeting at a public dinner-party
in Georgia, a young South Carolinian gave as a sentiment: "George McDuffie--the pride of South
Carolina." This was immediately responded to by Mirabeau B. Lamar, the late President of Texas,
who was then young, and a great pet of his friends, with another: "Colonel William Cumming--

  "The man who England's arms defied,
    A bar to base designers;
  Who checked alike old Britain's pride
    And noisy South Carolina's."

The wit of the impromptu was so fine and the company so appreciative, that, as if by common
consent, all enjoyed it, and good feeling was not disturbed.

McDuffie was not above the middle size. His features were large and striking, especially his
eyes, forehead, and nose. The latter was prominent and aquiline. His eyes were very brilliant,
blue, and deeply set under a massive brow--his mouth large, with finely chiselled lips, which,
in meeting, always wore the appearance of being compressed. In manners he was retiring without
being awkward. His temperament was nervous and ardent, and his feelings strong. His manner
when speaking was nervous and impassioned, and at times fiercely vehement, and again persuasive
and tenderly pathetic, and in every mood he was deeply eloquent.

In the after period of life these antagonists were, through the instrumentality of a noble-hearted
Hibernian, reconciled, and sincerely so--both regretting the past, and willing to bury its
memory in social intimacy. McDuffie married Miss Singleton, of South Carolina, one of the loveliest
and most accomplished ladies of the State.

Owing to the wound received in the duel with Cumming, his nervous system suffered, and finally
his brain. The ball remained imbedded in the spine, and pressed upon the spinal chord. An attempt
to remove it, the surgeons determined, would be more hazardous to life than to permit it to
remain. There was no remedy. From its effects his mind began to decay, and finally perished,
leaving him, long before his death, a melancholy imbecile. In all the relations of life this
great man was faithful to his duties--a devoted husband, a sincere friend, a kind neighbor,
and a considerate and indulgent master to his slaves. He was one of those rare creations for
which there is no accounting. None of his family evinced more than very ordinary minds; nor
can there be traced in his ancestry one after whom his nature and abilities were marked. His
morals were as pure and elevated as his intellect was grand and comprehensive, and his soul
was as lofty and chivalrous as the Chevalier Bayard's. His fame is too broad to be claimed
alone by South Carolina. Georgia is proud of giving him birth, and the nation cherishes his glory.

CHAPTER VIII.

FIFTY YEARS AGO.

Immediately subsequent to the Revolution, all the country northwest of the Ogeechee River,
in the middle portion of the State of Georgia, was divided into two counties, Franklin and
Wilkes. It was a wilderness, and contiguous to both the Creek and Cherokee Indian nations.
No country in the world was more beautiful in its topography, and few more fertile in soil.
Governor Mathews had purchased a home in this region; and being at this time the principal
man in the up-country, attracted to his neighborhood the emigrants who began to come into the
country.

Mathew's Revolutionary services in the command of a regiment in the Virginia line were eminent;
and his character for intrepidity naturally made him a leader among such men as were likely
to seek and make homes in a new country.

Surrounded not only with all the difficulties presented to him by the unsubdued wilderness,
but the perils of savage warfare, he unflinchingly went forward in his enterprise, daring and
conquering every obstacle nature and the savages interposed. He was an uneducated man; but
of strong mind, ardent temperament, and most determined will. Many anecdotes are related of
his intrepidity, self-respect, and unbending will. He was a native of Augusta County, Virginia,
and emigrated to Georgia about the same time that Elijah Clarke came from North Carolina and
settled in that portion of the new territory now known as Clarke County.

These two remarkable men formed a nucleus for those of their respective States who came at
subsequent periods to make a home in Georgia. They were models to the youth of their respective
neighborhoods, and gave tone to the character of the population for many years after they were
in their graves. About the same time, the Earlys came from Virginia, and the Abercrombies from
North Carolina, and located respectively in the new counties of Greene and Hancock. They were
all men of strong character, and all exercised great influence with those who accompanied or
came to them at a subsequent period.

Among the very first to locate in Greene County was Colonel David Love, from North Carolina,
and soon after came the Nesbits, Jacksons, and Hortons; all of whom settled upon the head-waters
of the Ogeechee and upon Shoulderbone Creek.

The country was very attractive, the soil very generous, the water good, and the health remarkable.
The general topography of Middle Georgia (as that portion of Georgia is now termed) is unsurpassed
by any other portion of the State for beauty--hill and dale, the one not rising many feet above
the other, generally with beautiful slopes, and scarcely at any place with so much abruptness
as to forbid cultivation. Upon these lovely acclivities were built the cabins of the emigrants,
at the base of which, and near the house, was always to be found a fountain of pure, sweet
water, gushing and purling away over sand and pebbles, meandering through a valley which it
fertilized, and which abounds in shrubs flowering in beauty, and sheltered by forests of oak,
hickory, pine, and gum.

Those who first came were frequently compelled to unite in a settlement at some selected point,
and, for defence against the inroads of the savages, were obliged to build stockade forts,
with blockhouses.

Nature seems to have prepared, during the Revolution, men for subduing the wilderness and its
savage inhabitants. They cheerfully encountered all the difficulties and hazards thus presented,
and constantly pursued their object to its consummation. They came from every section of the
older communities, and all seemed animated with the same spirit. They were orderly, but rude;
and though beyond the pale of the law, they were a law unto themselves; and these laws were
strictly enforced by a public opinion which gave them being and efficiency. With remarkably
simple habits and very limited opportunities, their wants were few; and these were supplied
by their own industry and frugality upon the farm. Their currency was silver coin, Spanish
milled, and extremely limited in quantity. The little trade carried on was principally by barter,
and social intercourse was confined almost exclusively to the Sabbath. The roads were rough
and uneven, consisting almost entirely of a way sufficiently wide for an ox-cart to pass, cut
through the forest, where the stumps and stones remained; and in soft or muddy places, the
bodies of small trees or split rails were placed side by side, so as to form a sort of bridge
or causeway, so rough as to test and not unfrequently to destroy the wheels of the rude vehicles
of the country. These obtained and to this day receive the sobriquet of Georgia railroads or
corduroy turnpikes.

Very few of these immigrants were independent of labor; and most of them devoted six days of
the week to the cultivation of a small farm and its improvement. Children learned early to
assist in this labor, and those who were sent to school, almost universally employed the Saturday
of each week in farm-work.

Man's social nature induces aggregation into communities, which stimulates an ambition to excel
in every undertaking. From this emulation grows excellence and progress in every laudable enterprise.
These small communities, as they grew from accessions coming into the country, began to build
rude places for public worship, which were primitive log-cabins, and served as well the purposes
of a school-house. Here the adult population assembled on the Sabbath, and the children during
the week. This intercourse, together with the dependence of every one at times for neighborly
assistance, was greatly promotive of harmony and mutual confidence. Close and familiar acquaintance
revealed to all the peculiar character of every one--the virtuous and the vicious, the energetic
or the indolent, the noble and the ignoble--and all very soon came to be appreciated according
to their merit.

Rude sports constituted the amusements of the young--wrestling, leaping, and hunting; and he
who was most expert at these was the neighborhood's pride: he rode from church with the prettiest
girl, and was sure to be welcomed by her parents when he came; and to be selected by such an
one was to become the neighborhood's belle. At log-rollings, quiltings, and Saturday-night
frolics, he was the first and the most admired.

The girls, too, were not without distinction--she who could spin the greatest number of cuts
of cotton, or weave the greatest number of yards of cloth, was most distinguished, and most
admired; but especially was she distinguished who could spin and weave the neatest fabric for
her own wear, of white cloth with a turkey-red stripe--cut, and make it fit the labor-rounded
person and limbs--or make, for father's or brother's wear, the finest or prettiest piece of
jean--cook the nicest dinners for her beau, or dance the longest without fatigue.

The sexes universally associated at the same school, (a system unfortunately grown out of use,)
and grew up together with a perfect knowledge of the disposition, temperament, and general
character of each other. And, as assuredly as the boy is father to the man, the girl is mother
to the woman; and these peculiarities were attractive or repulsive as they differed in individuals,
and were always an influence in the selection of husbands and wives. The prejudices of childhood
endure through life, particularly those toward persons. They are universally predicated upon
some trait of manner or character, and these, as in the boy perceived, are ever prominent in
the man. So, too, with the girl, and they only grow with the woman. This is a paramount reason
why parties about contracting marriage-alliances should be well aware of whom they are about
to select. The consequence of this intercommunication of the sexes from childhood, in the primitive
days of Georgia's first settlement, was seen in the harmony of families. In the age which followed,
a separation or divorce was as rare as an earthquake; and when occurring, agitated the whole
community. For then a marriage was deemed a life-union, for good or for evil, and was not lightly
or inconsiderately entered into.

The separation of the sexes in early youth, and especially at school, destroys or prevents
in an eminent degree the restraining influences upon the actions of each other, and that tender
desire for the society of each other, which grows from childhood's associations. Brought together
at school in early life, when the mind and soul are receiving the impressions which endure
through life, they naturally form intimacies, and almost always special partialities and preferences.
Each has his or her favorite, these partialities are usually reciprocal, and their consequence
is a desire on the part of each to see the other excel. To accomplish this, children, as well
as grown people, will make a greater effort than they will simply to succeed or to gratify
a personal ambition to that effect. Thus they sympathize with and stimulate each other. Every
Georgia boy of fifty years ago, with gray-head and tottering step now, remembers his sweetheart,
for whom he carried his hat full of peaches to school, and for whom he made the grape-vine
swing, and how at noon he swung her there.

  'T is bonny May; and I to-day
    Am wrinkled seventy-four,
  Still I enjoy, as when a boy,
    Much that has gone before.

  Is it the leaves and trees, or sheaves
    Of yellow, ripened grain,
  Which wake to me, in memory,
    My boyhood's days again?

  These seem to say 't is bonny May,
    As when they sweetly grew,
  And gave their yield, in wood and field,
    To me, when life was new.

  But nought beside--ah, woe betide!--
    Which grew with me is here--
  The home, the hall, the mill, the all
    Which young life holds so dear.

  The school-house, spring, and little thing,
    With eyes so bright and blue,
  Who'd steal away with me and play
    When school's dull hours were through,

  Are memories now; and yet, oh! how
    It seems but yesterday
  Since I was there, with that sweet dear,
    In the wild wood at play.

  The hill was steep where we would leap;
    The grape-vine swing hung high,
  And I would throw the swing up so
    That, startled, she would cry.

  But though she cried, she still relied
    (And seemed to have no fear)
  On me to hold the swing, and told
    Me "not to frighten her."

  But I was wild, and she no child,
    And not afraid, I deemed;
  So tossed as high the swing as I
    Could--when she fell and screamed.

  She was not harmed; but I, alarmed,
    Ran quickly to assist,
  And lifted her, all pale with fear,
    Within my arms, and kissed

  Her pallid cheek, ere she could speak:
    But I had seen, you know,
  (Ah! what of this? that sight and kiss
    Was fifty years ago,)

  That little boot and pretty foot,
    So neatly formed and small--
  The swelling calf, and stifled laugh--
    How I remember all!

  That lovely one has long since gone,
    Is dust, and only dust, now;
  Yet I recall that swing and fall,
    As though it had been just now.

Take these lines, reader, if you please, as an evidence of how the memories growing out of
the associations of boyhood's school-days endure through life. This association of the sexes
operates as a restraint upon both, salutary to good conduct and good morals. Such restraints
are far more effective than the staid lessons of some old, wrinkled duenna of a school-mistress,
whose failure to find a sweetheart in girlhood, or a husband in youthful womanhood, has soured
her toward every man, and filled her with hatred for the happiness she witnesses in wedded
life, and which is ever present all around her. Her warnings are in violation of nature. She
has forgotten she was ever young or inspired with the feelings and hopes of youth. Men are
monsters, and marriage a hell upon earth. Girls will not believe this, and will get married.
How much better, then, that they should cultivate, in association, the generous and natural
feelings of the heart, and during the period allotted by nature for the growth of the feelings
natural to the human bosom, as well as to the growth of the person and mind, than to be told
what they should be by one disappointed of all the fruits of them, and hating the world because
she is! It is the mother who should form the sentiments and direct the conduct of daughters,
and in their teachings should never forget that nature is teaching also. Let their lessons
always teach the proper indulgences of nature, as well as the proper and prudent restraints
to the natural feelings of the human heart, and so deport themselves toward their daughters
from infancy as to win their confidence and affection. The daughters, when properly trained,
will always come with their little complaints in childhood, and seek consolation, leaning upon
the parent's knee, and, with solicitude, look up into the parental face for sympathy and advice.
Home-teaching and home-training makes the proper woman. When this is properly attended to,
there needs no boarding-school or female-college finish, which too frequently uproots every
virtuous principle implanted by the careful and affectionate teaching of pious, gentle, and
intelligent mothers. But few mothers, who are themselves properly trained, forget nature in
the training and education of their daughters; and a truly natural woman is a blessing to society
and a crown of glory to her husband. I mean by a natural training a knowledge of herself, as
well as a knowledge of the offices of life and the domestic duties of home. Every woman in
her girlhood should learn from her mother the mission and destinies of woman, as well as what
is due to society, to their families, to themselves, and to God. The woman who enters life
with a knowledge of what life is, and what is due to her and from her in all the relations
of life, has a thousand chances for happiness through life unknown to the belle of the boarding-school,
who, away from home influences, is artificially educated to be in all things prominent before
the world, and entirely useless in the discharge of domestic duties. She may figure as the
lady-president or vice-president of charitable associations, or the lady-president of some
prominent or useless society; but never as a dutiful, devoted wife, or affectionate, instructive
mother to her children. Her household is managed by servants, and about her home nothing evinces
the neat, provident, and attentive housewife.

The whole system of education, as practised by the Protestants of the United States, is wrong;
religious prejudice prevents their learning from the Catholics, and particularly from the Jesuit
Catholics, who are far in advance of their Protestant brethren. They learn from the child as
they teach the child. In the first place, none are permitted to teach who are not by nature,
as well as by education, qualified to teach; nature must give the gentleness, the kindness,
and the patience, with the capacity to impart instruction. They learn, first, the child's nature,
the peculiarities of temper, and fashion these to obedience and affection; they first teach
the heart to love--not fear; they warn against the evils of life--teach the good, and the child's
duties to its parents, to its brothers and sisters, to its teachers, to its playmates, and
to its God. When the heart is mellowed and yields obedience in the faithful discharge of these
duties, and the brain sufficiently matured to comprehend the necessity of them, then attention
is directed to the mind; its capacities are learned and known, and it is treated as this knowledge
teaches is proper: it is, as the farmer knows, the soil of his cultivation, and is prepared
by careful tillage before the seed is sown. The vision of the child's mind is by degrees expanded;
the horizon of its knowledge is enlarged, and still the heart's culture goes on in kindness
and affection. The pupil has learned to love the teacher, and receives with alacrity his teaching;
he goes to him, without fear, for information on every point of duty in morals, as on every
difficult point of literary learning. He knows he will be received kindly, and dealt with gently.
Should he err, he is never rebuked in public, nor harshly in private; the teacher is aggrieved,
and in private he kindly complains to the offender, whose love for his preceptor makes him
to feel, and repent, and to err no more. All this is only known to the two; his school-fellows
never know, and have no opportunity for triumph or raillery. Thus taught from the cradle, principles
become habits; and on these, at maturity, he is launched upon the world, with every safeguard
for his future life. So with the girl. With the experience of forty-five years, the writer
has never known a vicious, bad woman, wife, or mother trained in a Jesuit convent, or reared
by an educated Catholic mother.

The daughters of the pioneers of Georgia's early settlements received a home education; at
least, in the duties of domestic life. In the discharge of these duties, they gained robust
constitutions and vigorous health; they increased the butcher's bill at the expense of the
doctor's; and such women were the mothers of the men who have made a history for their country,
for themselves and their mothers. I may be prolix and prosaic, but I love to remember the mothers
of fifty years ago--she who gave birth to Lucius Q.C. and Mirabeau B. Lamar, to William C.
Dawson, Bishop George Pierce, Alexander Stuart, Joseph Lumpkin, and glorious Bob Toombs. I
knew them all, and, with affectionate delight, remember their virtues, and recall the social
hours we have enjoyed together, when they were matrons, and I the companion of their sons.
And now, when all are gone, and time is crowding me to the grave, the nobleness of their characters,
the simplicity of their bearing in the discharge of their household duties, and the ingenuousness
of their manners in social intercourse, is a cherished, venerated memory. None of these women
were ever in a boarding-school, never received a lesson in the art of entering a drawing-room
or captivating a beau. They were sensible, modest, and moral women, and their virtues live
after them in the exalted character of their illustrious sons. Their literary education in
early life was, of necessity, neglected, because of the want of opportunities; but in the virtues
and duties of life, they were thoroughly educated; and none of these, or any of their like,
was ever Mrs. President or Secretary of any pretentious or useless society or association.

The little education or literature they acquired was in the old log school-house, where boys
and girls commingled as pupils under the teaching of some honest pedagogue, who aspired to
teach only reading, writing, and arithmetic, in a simple way. It must not be supposed, from
the foregoing remarks, that I object to female education; on the contrary, I would have every
woman an educated woman. But I would have this education an useful and proper education; one
not wholly ornamental and of no practical use, but one obtained at home, and under the parental
care and influence--such an one as made Mrs. Ripley, of Concord, Massachusetts, the wonder
and admiration of every sensible man. She who studied La Place's Mécanique Céleste when she
was making biscuit for her breakfast, and who solved a problem in the higher mathematics when
darning her stockings; an education where the useful may be taught and learned to grace the
ornamental--where the harp and piano shall share with the needle and the cooking-stove, and
the pirouettes of the dancing-master shall be only a step from the laundry and the kitchen.

The duties of wives and mothers are to home, husband, and children; and this includes all of
woman's duty to the country, and in the intelligent and faithful discharge of which the great
ends of life are subserved. Good neighborhood, good government, and happy communities secure
the implanting and cultivation of good principles, and the proper teaching of proper duties.
The wise direction of literary education to sons and to daughters, all comes within the range
of home, and home duties especially incumbent upon mothers. The domestic duties and domestic
labors should be a prime consideration in the education of daughters. The association of the
mother and child from birth, until every principle which is to guide and govern it through
life is implanted, makes it the duty of the mother to know the right, and to teach it, too.
Example and precept should combine; and this necessity compels a constant watch, not only over
the child's, but over the mother's language and conduct. All these duties imply a close devotion
to home: for here is the germ which is to grow into good or into evil, as it is nursed and
cultivated, or wickedly neglected. Begin at the beginning, if you would accomplish well your
work; and to do this, application and assiduity are indispensable; and these are duties only
to be discharged at home. They admit of a relaxation of time sufficient for every social duty
exacted by society, if that society is such as it should be; and if not, it should neither
occupy time not attention.

In this is comprised all woman's duties, and they are paramount; for upon their successful
application depend the well-being of society and the proper and healthful administration of
wise and salutary laws. The world is indebted to woman for all that is good and great. Let
every woman emulate Cornelia, the Roman mother, and, when a giddy, foolish neighbor runs to
her to exhibit newly purchased jewels, be found, like the Roman matron, at her tambour-work;
and like her, too, when her boys from school shall run to embrace her, say to the thoughtless
one, "These are my jewels!" and Rome will not alone boast of her Gracchi and their incomparable
mother.

The duties of home cultivate reflection and stimulate to virtue. For this reason, women are
more pious than men; and for this reason, too, they are more eminent in purity. Contact with
the domestic circle does not contaminate or corrupt, as the baser contact with the world is
sure to do.

The home circle is select and chaste--the promiscuous intermingling with the world meretricious
and contaminating. The mother not trained to the appreciation and discharge of the domestic
duties, was never the mother of a great representative mind; because she is incapable of imparting
those stern principles of exalted morality and fixity of purpose essential in forming the character
of such men. The mother of Cincinnatus was a farmer's wife; of Leonidas, a shepherdess; and
the mothers of Washington, Webster, Clay, Calhoun, William H, Crawford, and Andrew Jackson
were all the wives of farmers--rural and simple in their pursuits, distinguished for energy
and purity; constant in their principles, and devoted to husband, home, and children. They
never dreamed it was woman's vocation or duty to go out into the world and mingle in its strifes
and contentions--but at home, to view them, reflect upon their consequences to society, and
upon the future of their sons and daughters, and warn them what to emulate and what to shun.
They, as did their husbands, felt the necessity of preserving that delicacy of thought and
action which is woman's ornament, and which is more efficient in rebuking licentiousness and
profligacy in the young and the old than all the teaching of the schools without such example.
Such were the mothers of the great and the good of our land, and such the mothers of those
men now prominent and distinguished in the advocacy and support of the great principles of
natural rights and humanity.

It is a mooted question whether the purposes of human life demand a high, classical education
among the masses; or whether the general happiness is promoted by such education. In the study
of the human mind in connection with human wants, we are continually met with difficulties
arising from the want of education; and quite as frequently with those resulting from education.
So much so, that we hear from every wise man the declaration that as many minds are ruined
by over-education as from the want of education.

Man's curse is to labor. This labor must of necessity be divided to subserve the wants of society--and
common sense would teach that each should be educated as best to enable him to perform that
labor which may fall to his lot in life. But who shall determine this lot? Every day's experience
teaches the observant and thinking man that no one individual is uselessly born. To deny this
proposition would be to call in question the wisdom and goodness of the Creator. Every one
possesses proclivities for some one avocation, and should be educated for its pursuit. This
is manifested in very early life; in some much more palpably than in others. This is always
the case when the aptitude is decisive. In such cases this idiosyncrasy will triumph over every
adverse circumstance, educational or otherwise; but in the less palpable, it will not; and
the design of nature may, and indeed constantly is, disappointed, and improper education and
improper pursuits given. In these pursuits or callings, the person thus improperly placed there
never succeeds as he would had his bent or mental inclination been observed, and his education
directed to it, and he given to its pursuit. Such persons labor through life painfully; they
have no taste or inclination for the profession, business, or trade in which they are engaged;
its pursuit is an irksome, thankless labor; while he who has fallen into nature's design, and
is working where his inclinations lead, labors happily, because he labors naturally. These
inclinations the parent or guardian should observe; and when manifested, should direct the
education for the calling nature has designed. Idiosyncrasies are transmissible or inherited.
In old and populous communities, where every pursuit or profession is full, the father generally
teaches his own to his son or sons. Where this has extended through three or four generations,
the proclivity is generally strongly marked, and in very early childhood made manifest. Thus,
in the third or fourth generation, where all have been blacksmiths, the child will be born
with the muscles of the right arm more developed than those of the left, and the first plaything
he demands is a hammer. So, where a family have been traders, will the offspring naturally
discover an aptness for bargaining and commerce. This is illustrated in the instincts of the
Jews, a people of extraordinary brain and wonderful tenacity of purpose. Five thousand years
since, a small fragment of the Semitic race, residing in Mesopotamia between the waters of
the Euphrates and the Tigris, consisting of two families, came into the land of Canaan, in
Asia Minor; from them have descended the people known as Jews. The country over which they
spread, and which is known as Judea, is not more than four hundred miles long by two hundred
and fifty in breadth, situated between two populous and powerful empires, the Assyrian and
Egyptian, who, waging war too frequently, made the land of Judea their battle-field, and its
people the objects of persecution and oppression. The earnings of their labor were deemed legitimate
prey by both, and taken wherever found: they were led into captivity by the Assyrians and by
the Egyptians, enslaved, and denied the legal right to possess the soil--which, to the everlasting
disgrace of Christian Europe, was a restriction upon this wonderful people until within the
present century. A blind bigotry would have blotted them from the face of the earth, but for
that energy, talent, and enterprise possessed by them in a superior degree to any people upon
the globe. Inspired by a sublime belief that they were the chosen people of God, no tyranny
nor oppression could subdue their energies. They prayed and labored, went forward with untiring
determination, upheld by their faith, and always, under the direst distress, found comfort
from this belief and the fruits of incessant labor. The soil of their loved Canaan was barren,
and yielded grudgingly to the most persistent labor. This drove them to trade, and an extended
intercourse with the world. Without a national government of sufficient power to protect them
when robbed by the people or the governments surrounding their own, they were compelled, for
self-protection, to resort to every means of concealing the earnings of their enterprise and
superior knowledge and skill from Christian and pagan alike. They gave value to the diamond,
that in a small stone, easy of concealment, immense wealth might be hidden. They invented the
bill of exchange, by which they could at pleasure transfer from one country to another their
wealth, and avoid the danger of spoliation from the hand of power and intolerance. Without
political or civil rights in any but their own country, they were compelled to the especial
pursuit of commerce for centuries, and we now see that seven-tenths of all Jews born, as naturally
turn to trade and commerce as the infant to the breast. It has become an instinct.

To these persecutions the world is probably indebted for the developments of commerce--the
bringing into communication the nations of the earth for the exchange of commodities necessary
to the use and comfort of each other, not of the growth or production of each, enlarging the
knowledge of all thus communicating, and teaching that civilization which is the enlightenment
and the blessing of man--ameliorating the savage natures of all, and teaching that all are
of God, and equally the creatures of His love and protection; and leading also to that development
of mind in the Israelite which makes him conspicuous to-day above any other race in the great
attributes of mind--directing the policy of European governments--first at the Bar, first in
science, first in commerce, first in wealth--preserving the great traits of nationality without
a nation, and giving tone, talent, wealth, and power to all. 

But then that you sit he said in pleasure. One matter which tended to alliterator. It was very,

The rude condition of a country is always imparted to the character of its people, and out
of this peculiarity spring the rough sports and love of coarse jokes and coarse humor. No people
ever more fully verified this truth than the Georgians, and to-day, even among her best educated,
the love of fun is a prevailing trait. Her traditions are full of the practical jokes and the
practical jokers of fifty years ago. The names of Dooly, Clayton, Prince, Bacon, and Longstreet
will be remembered in the traditions of fun as long as the descendants of their compatriots
continue to inhabit the land. The cock-fight, the quarter-race, and the gander-pulling are
traditions now, and so is the fun they gave rise to; and I had almost said, so is the honesty
of those who were participants in these rude sports. Were they not more innocent outlets to
the excessive energies of a mercurial and fun-loving people than the faro-table and shooting-gallery
of to-day? Every people must have their amusements and sports, and these, unrestrained, will
partake of the character of the people and the state of society. Sometimes the narrow prejudices
of bigoted folly will inveigh against these, and insist upon their restraint by law; and these
laws, in many of the States, remain upon the statute-book a rebuking evidence of the shameless
folly of fanatical ignorance. Of these, the most conspicuous are the blue-laws of Connecticut,
and the more absurd and criminal laws of Massachusetts against amusements not only necessary,
but healthful and innocent. Even in the present advanced state of knowledge and civilization,
do we occasionally hear ranted from the pulpit denunciations of dancing, as a sinful and God-offending
amusement. Such men should not be permitted to teach or preach--it is to attenuate folly and
fanaticism, to circumscribe the happiness of youth, and belie the Bible.

The emigrants to Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia were all persons of like character, combining
a mixture of English, Irish, and Scotch blood. They were enterprising, daring, and remarkable
for great good sense. Rude from the want of education and association with a more polished
people, they were nevertheless high-principled and full of that chivalrous spirit which prompts
a natural courtesy, courts danger, and scorns the little and mean--open-handed in their generosity,
and eminently candid and honest in all their intercourse and dealings with their fellow-men.
These elements, collected from various sections, combined to form new communities in the wild
and untamed regions. In their conflicts with the savages were shown a daring fearlessness and
a high order of military talent in very many of the prominent leaders of the different settlements.
They had no chronicler to note and record their exploits, and they exist now only in the traditions
of the country.

The names of Shelby and Kenton, of Kentucky; of Davidson and Jackson, of Tennessee; of Clarke,
Mathews, and Adams, of Georgia; Dale, of Alabama, and Claiborne, of Mississippi, live in the
memory of the people of their States, together with those of Tipton, Sevier, Logan, and Boone,
and will be in the future history of these States, with their deeds recorded as those whose
enterprise, energy, and fearlessness won from the wilderness and the savage their fertile and
delightful lands, to be a home and a country for their posterity.

The children of such spirits intermarrying, could but produce men of talent and enterprise,
and women of beauty, intelligence, and virtue. In the veins of these ran only streams of blue
blood--such as filled the veins of the leaders of the Crusades--such as warmed the hearts of
the O'Neals and O'Connors, of Wallace and Bruce, and animated the bosoms of the old feudal
barons of England, who extorted the great charter of human liberty from King John. There was
no mixture of the pale Saxon to taint or dilute the noble current of the Anglo-Norman blood
which flowed through and fired the hearts of these descendants of the nobility and gentry of
Britain. They were the cavaliers in chivalry and daring, and despised, as their descendants
despised, the Roundheads and their descendants, with their cold, dissembling natures, hypocritical
in religion as faithless in friendship, without one generous emotion or ennobling sentiment.

It is not remarkable that conflict should ensue between races so dissimilar in a struggle to
control the Government: true to the instincts of race, each contended for that which best suited
their genius and wants; and not at all remarkable that all the generous gallantry in such a
conflict should be found with the Celt, and all the cruel rapacity and meanness with the Saxon.
Their triumph, through the force of numbers, was incomplete, until their enemies were tortured
by every cruelty of oppression, and the fabric of the Government dashed to atoms. This triumph
can only be temporary. The innate love of free institutions, universal in the heart of the
Celtic Southerner, will yet unite all the races to retrieve the lost. This done, victory is
certain.

The descendants of these pioneers have gone out to people the extended domain reaching around
the Gulf, and are growing into strength, without abatement of the spirit of their ancestors.
Very soon time and their energies will repair the disasters of the recent conflict; and reinvigorated,
the shackles of the Puritan shall restrain no longer, when a fierce democracy shall restore
the Constitution, and with it the liberty bequeathed by their ancestors.

With this race, fanaticism in religion has never known a place. Rational and natural, they
have ever worshipped with the heart and the attributes of their faith. Truth, sincerity, love,
and mercy have ever marked their characters. Too honest to be superstitious, and too sincere
to be hypocrites, the concentrated love of freedom unites the race, and the hatred of tyranny
will stimulate the blood which shall retrieve it from the dominion of the baser blood now triumphant
and rioting in the ruin they have wrought.

In the beginning of the settlements, and as soon as fears of the inroads from the savages had
subsided, attention was given to the selection of separate and extended homes over the country,
to the opening of farms, and their cultivation. The first consideration was food and raiment.
All of this was to be the production of the farm and home industry: grain enough was to be
grown to serve the wants of the family for bread, and to feed the stock; for this was to furnish
the meat, milk, and butter. Cotton enough to serve the wants of families, together with the
wool from the flock, and some flax, were of prime consideration. All of this was prepared and
manufactured into fabrics for clothing and bedding at home. The seed from the cotton was picked
by hand; for, as yet, Whitney had not given them the cotton-gin. This work was imposed most
generally upon the children of families, white and black, as a task at night, and which had
to be completed before going to bed; an ounce was the usual task, which was weighed and spread
before the fire; for it was most easily separated from the seed when warm and dry. Usually
some petty rewards stimulated the work. In every family it was observed and commented upon,
that these rewards excited the diligence of the white children, but were without a corresponding
effect upon the black; and any one who has ever controlled the negro knows that his labor is
only in proportion to the coercion used to enforce it. His capacity, physically, is equal to
the white; but this cannot be bought, or he persuaded to exert it of himself, and is given
only through punishment, or the fear of it. The removal of restraint is to him a license to
laziness; and the hope of reward, or the cravings of nature, will only induce him to labor
sufficiently to supply these for immediate and limited relief.

Stock of every kind except horses was left to find a support in the forest, and at that time,
when their range was unlimited, they found it in abundance. Increasing wants stimulated the
cultivation of a market crop to supply them, and indigo and tobacco were first resorted to.
Tobacco was the principal staple, and the method of its transportation was extraordinary. As
at the present day in Kentucky, it was pressed into very large hogsheads. Upon these were pinned
large wooden felloes, forming the circle of a wheel around the hogshead at either end, and
in the centre of each head a large pin was inserted. Upon these pins were attached shafts or
thills, as to a cart, and to these teams, and thus the hogshead was rolled along rough roads
and through streams for sometimes ninety miles to Augusta, for a market. When sold, the shafts
were reserved, and upon these was then erected a sort of box, into which the few articles purchased
were placed, and dragged home. These articles almost universally consisted of some iron and
steel, and a little coffee and sugar, and sometimes a quarter of a pound of tea--universally
termed store-tea, to distinguish it from that made from the root of the sassafras and the leaf
of the cassia or tepaun-bush.

Cotton was, to some little extent, cultivated near the seaboard in Georgia and South Carolina,
and cleaned of the seeds by a machine similar to that used at the present day for preparing
the sea-island cotton for market. This was a tedious and troublesome method, and was incapable
of doing the work to any very great extent. Indigo, of a superior quality to the American,
was being produced in British India and Central America, and the competition was reducing the
price to the cost of production. The same difficulty attended the growing of tobacco. Virginia
and Maryland, with their abundance of labor, were competing, and cheapening the article to
a price which made its production unprofitable. At this juncture, Whitney invented the cotton-gin,
and the growth of cotton as a marketable crop commenced upon a more extended scale. In a few
years it became general--each farmer growing more or less, according to his means. Some one
man, most able to do so, erected a gin-house, first in a county, then in each neighborhood.
These either purchased in the seed the cotton of their neighbors, or ginned it and packed it
for a certain amount of toll taken from the cotton. This packing was done in round bales, and
by a single man, with a heavy iron bar, and was a most laborious and tedious method; and the
packages were in the most inconvenient form for handling and transportation.

Up to this time the slave-trade had been looked upon most unfavorably by the people of the
South. Among the first sermons I remember to have heard, was one depicting the horrors of this
trade. I was by my grandmother's side at Bethany, in Greene county, and, though a child, I
remember, as if of yesterday, the description of the manner of capturing the African in his
native wilds--how the mother and father were murdered, and the boys and the girls borne away,
and how England was abused for the cruel inhumanity of the act. Although unused to the melting
mood, the old lady wiped from her eyes a tear, whether in sorrow or sympathy for outraged humanity,
or in compliment to the pathos and power of her favorite preacher, I was too young to know
or have an opinion. I remember well, however, that she cried, for she pinched me most unmercifully
for laughing at her, and at home spanked me for crying. Dear old grandmother! but yesterday
I was at your grave, where you have slept fifty-two years, and if I laughed above thy mould
at the memory of the many bouts we had more than sixty years ago, and, from the blue bending
above, thy spirit looked down in wrath upon the unnatural outrage, be appeased ere I come;
for I should fear to meet thee, even in heaven, if out of humor! The roses bloomed above you--sweet
emblems of thy purity and rest--and there, close by you, were the pear-trees, planted by your
hands, around the roots of which you gathered the rods of my reformation; for I was a truant
child. You meant it all for my good, no doubt; but to me it was passing through purgatory then,
to merit a future good in time. Ah! how well I remember it--all of it. Requiescat in pace.
I had almost irreverently said, "Rest, cat, in peace."

It was at this period that the competition for accumulating money may be said to have commenced
in Middle Georgia. Labor became in great demand, and the people began to look leniently upon
the slave-trade. The marching of Africans, directly imported, through the country for sale,
is a memory of sixty-five years ago. The demand had greatly increased, and, with this, the
price. The trade was to cease in 1808, and the number brought over was daily augmenting, to
hasten to make from the traffic as much money as possible before this time should arrive. The
demand, however, was greater than could be supplied. From house to house they were carried
for sale. They were always young men and women, or girls and boys, and their clothing was of
the simplest kind. That of the men and boys consisted of drawers, only reaching midway the
thigh, from the waist. The upper portions of the person and the lower extremities were entirely
nude. The females wore a chemise reaching a few inches below the knee, leaving bare the limbs.
This was adopted for the purpose of exposing the person, as much as decency would permit, for
examination, so as to enable the purchaser to determine their individual capacity for labor.
This examination was close and universal, beginning with an inspection of the teeth, which
in these young savages were always perfect, save in those where they had been filed to a point
in front. This was not uncommon with the males. It was then extended to the limbs, and ultimately
to the entire person. They were devoid of shame, and yielded to this inspection without the
slightest manifestation of offended modesty. At first they were indifferent to cooked food,
and would chase and catch and eat the grasshoppers and lizards with the avidity of wild turkeys,
and seemed, as those fowls, to relish these as their natural food.

From such is descended the race which our Christian white brothers of the North have, in their
devotion to their duty to God and their hatred to us, made masters of our destiny. Our faith
in the justice and goodness of the same Divine Being bids us believe this unnatural and destructive
domination will not be permitted to endure for any lengthy period. Could the curtain which
veiled out the future sixty years ago, have been lifted, and the vision of those then subduing
the land been permitted to pierce and know the present of their posterity, they would then
have achieved a separation from our puritanical oppressors, and built for themselves and their
own race, even if in blood, a separate government, and have made it as nature intended it should
be to this favored land--a wise and powerful one.

Sooner or later these intentions of Divine wisdom are consummated. The fallible nature of man,
through ignorance or the foolish indulgence of bad passions in the many, enable the few to
delude and control the many, and to postpone for a time the inevitable; but as assuredly as
time endures, nature's laws work out natural ends. Generations may pass away, perhaps perish
from violence, and others succeed with equally unnatural institutions, making miserable the
race, until it, like the precedent, passes from the earth. Yet these great laws work on, and
in the end triumph in perfecting the Divine will.

To the wise and observant this design of the Creator is ever apparent; to the foolish and wicked,
never.

John Wesley had visited Savannah, and travelled through the different settlements then in embryo,
teaching the tenets and introducing the simple worship of the church of his founding, after
a method established by himself, and which gave name and form to the sect, now, and almost
from its incipiency known as Methodist. This organization and the tenets of its faith were
admirably suited to a rude people, and none perhaps could have been more efficient in forming
and improving such morals. Unpretending, simple in form, devoid of show or ceremony, it appealed
directly to the purer emotions of our nature, and through the natural devotion of the heart
lifted the mind to the contemplation and inspired the soul with the love of God. Its doctrines,
based upon the purest morality, easily comprehensible, and promising salvation to all who would
believe, inspiring an enthusiasm for a pure life, were natural, and naturally soon became wide-spread,
and as the writer believes, has done more in breaking away the shackles of ignorance and debasing
superstition from the mind, than any other system of worship or doctrine of faith taught by
man; and to this, in a great degree, is due the freedom of thought, independence of feeling
and action, chivalrous bearing, and high honor of the Southern people. Inculcating as it does
the simple teachings of the gospel of Christ,--to live virtuously--do no wrong--love thy neighbor
as thyself, and unto all do as you would be done by,--a teaching easy of comprehension, and
which, when sternly enforced by a pure and elevated public sentiment, becomes the rule of conduct,
and society is blessed with harmony and right. This moral power is omnipotent for good, concentrating
communities into one without divisions or dissensions, to be wielded for good at once and at
all times. Nothing evil can result from such concentration of opinions being directed by the
vicious and wicked, so long as the moral of this faith shall control the mind and heart.

Camp-meetings, an institution of this church, and which were first commenced in Georgia, are
a tradition there now. Here and there through the country yet remains, in ruinous decay, the
old stand or extemporized pulpit from which the impassioned preacher addressed the assembled
multitude of anxious listeners; and around the square now overgrown with brush-wood and forest-trees,
prostrate and rotten, the remains of the cabin tents may be seen, where once the hospitality
of the owners and worshippers was dispensed with a heartiness and sincerity peculiar to the
simple habits, and honest, kindly emotions of a rude and primitive people.

How well do I remember the first of these meetings I ever witnessed! I was a small lad, and
rode behind my father on horseback to the ground. It was sixty-five years ago. The concourse
was large, consisting of the people of all the country around--men, women, and children, white
and black. Around a square enclosing some six acres of ground, the tents were arranged--arbors
of green boughs cut from the adjoining forest formed a shelter from the sun's rays. In front
of all of these, shading the entrance to the tent, under this friendly sheltering from the
heat of the sun, assembled the owners and the guests of each, in social and unceremonious intercourse.
This was strictly the habit of the young people; and here, in evening's twilight, has been
plighted many a vow which has been redeemed by happy unions for life's journey, and to be consummated
when the cold weather came. In the rear of the tents were temporary kitchens, presided over
in most instances by some old, trusted aunty of ebon hue, whose pride it was to prepare the
meals for her tent, and to hear her cooking praised by the preachers and the less distinguished
guests of master and mistress. The sermons were preached in the morning, at noon, and at twilight,
when all the multitude were summoned to the grand central stand in the square of the encampment
by sounding a tin trumpet or ox-horn. My childish imagination was fired at the sight of this
assemblage. My wonder was, whence come all these people? as converging from the radius around
came the crowding multitude, without order and without confusion--the farmer and his brusque
wife side by side, leading their flock and friends: he with an ample chair of home manufacture
slung by his side for the wife's comfort as she devoutly listened to the pious brother's comforting
sermon--the guests and the young of the family following in respectful silence, and at a respectful
distance, all tending to the great arbor of bushes covering the place of worship. Over all
the space of the encampment the under-brush had been carefully removed; but the great forest-trees
(for these encampments were always in a forest) were left to shade as well as they might the
pulpit-stand and grounds. All around was dense forest, wild and beautiful as nature made it.

How well the scene and the worship accorded! There was congruity in all--the woods, the tents,
the people, and the worship. The impressions made that day upon my young mind were renewed
at many a camp-meeting in after years; and so indelibly impressed as only to pass away with
existence.

The preacher rose upon his elevated platform, and, advancing to the front, where a simple plank
extending from tree to tree, before him, formed a substitute for a table or desk, where rested
the hymn-book and Bible, commenced the service by reading a hymn, and then, line by line, repeating
it, to be sung by all his congregation.

Whoever has listened, in such a place, amidst a great multitude, to the singing of that beautiful
hymn commencing, "Come, thou fount of every blessing," by a thousand voices, all in accord,
and not felt the spirit of devotion burning in his heart, could scarcely be moved should an
angel host rend the blue above him, and, floating through the ether, praise God in song. In
that early day of Methodism, very few of those licensed to preach were educated men. They read
the Bible, and expounded its great moral truths as they understood them. Few of these even
knew that it had been in part originally written in the Hebrew tongue, and the other portion
in that of the Greeks; but he knew it contained the promise of salvation, and felt that it
was his mission to preach and teach this way to his people, relying solely for his power to
impress these wonderful truths upon the heart by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. For this
reason the sermons of the sect were never studied or written, and their excellence was their
fervor and impassioned appeals to the heart and the wild imaginations of the enthusiastic and
unlearned of the land. Genius, undisciplined and untutored by education, is fetterless, and
its spontaneous suggestions are naturally and powerfully effective, when burning from lips
proclaiming the heart's enthusiasm. Thus extemporizing orations almost daily, stimulated the
mind to active thought, and very many of these illiterate young Methodist preachers became
in time splendid orators.

It was the celebrated Charles James Fox who said to a young man just entering Parliament, if
he desired to become a great orator, and had the genius and feeling from nature, all he had
to do was to speak often and learn to think on his feet. It is to this practice the lawyer
and the preacher owe the oratory which distinguish these above every other class of men. And
yet, how few of them ever attain to the eminence of finished orators. Eloquence and oratory
are by no means identical: one is the attribute of the heart, the other of the head; and eloquence,
however unadorned, is always effective, because it is born of the feelings; and there is ever
a sympathy between the hearts of men, and the words, however rude and original, which bubble
up from the heart freighted with its feelings, rush with electrical force and velocity to the
heart, and stir to the extent of its capacities. Oratory, however finished, is from the brain,
and is an art; it may convince the mind and captivate the imagination, but never touches the
heart or stirs the soul. To awaken feelings in others, we must feel ourselves. Eloquence is
the volume of flame, oratory the shaft of polished ice; the one fires to madness, the other
delights and instructs.

Religion is the pathos of the heart, and must be awakened from the heart's emotions. The imagination
is the great attribute of the mind, gathering and creating thought and inspiring feeling. Hence,
the peculiar system of the Methodists in their worship is the most efficient in proselyting,
and especially with a rude, imaginative people.

The camp-meeting was an admirable device for this purpose, and its abandonment by the sect
is as foolish as would be that of a knight who would throw away his sword as he was rushing
to battle. Fashion is omnipotent in religion, as in other things, and with the more general
diffusion of education, camp-meetings have come to be considered as vulgar and unfashionable.
To be vulgar, is to be common; to be common, is to be natural. The masses, and especially in
democratic communities, must always be vulgar or common--must always be, in the main, illiterate
and rude; and it is for the conversion and salvation of these multitudes the preacher should
struggle, and in his efforts his most efficient means should be used.

The camp-meeting, at night, when all the fire-stands are ablaze, and the multitude are assembled
and singing, is beyond description picturesque: when, too, some eloquent and enthusiastic preacher
is stimulating to intense excitement the multitude around him with the fervor of his words,
and the wild, passionate manifestations of his manner, to see the crowd swaying to and fro,
to hear the groans and sobs of the half-frenzied multitude, and, not unfrequently, the maddened
shriek of hysterical fear, all coming up from the half-illuminated spot, is thrillingly exciting.
And when the sermon is finished, to hear all this heated mass break forth into song, the wild
melody of which floats, in the stillness of night, upon the breeze to the listening ear a mile
away, in cadences mournfully sweet, make the camp-meeting among the most exciting of human
exhibitions. In such a school were trained those great masters of pulpit oratory, Pierce, Wynans,
Capers, and Bascomb. Whitfield was the great exemplar of these; but none, perhaps, so imitated
his style and manner as John Newland Maffit and the wonderful Summerfield.

Like all that is great and enduring, the Methodist Church had its beginning among the humble
and lowly. Rocked in the cradle of penury and ignorance, it was firmly fixed in the foundations
of society, whence it rose from its own purity of doctrine and simplicity of worship to command
the respect, love, and adoption of the highest in the land, and to wield an influence paramount
in the destinies of the people and the Government. Its ministers are now the educated and eloquent
of the Church militant. Its institutions of learning are the first and most numerous all over
the South, and it has done for female education in the South more than every other sect of
Christians, excepting, perhaps, the Roman Catholic. In the cause of education its zeal is enlisted,
and its organization is such as to bring a wonderful power to operate upon the community in
every section of the South and West. That this will accomplish much, we have only to look to
the antecedents of the Church to determine. Like the coral insect, they never cease to labor:
each comes with his mite and deposits it; and, from the humblest beginning, this assiduity
and contribution builds up great islands in the sea of ignorance--rich in soil, salubrious
in climate, and, finally, triumphant in the conceptions of the chief architect--completing
for good the work so humbly begun.

The subject of education engaged the attention of the people of Georgia at a very early day
subsequent to the Revolution. Public schools were not then thought of; probably because such
a scheme would have been impracticable. The population was sparse, and widely separated in
all the rural districts of the country; and to have supplied all with the means of education,
would have necessitated an expense beyond the power of the State. A system was adopted, of
establishing and endowing academies in the different counties, at the county-seat, where young
men who intended to complete a collegiate education might be taught, and the establishment
and endowment of a college, where this education might be finished, leaving the rudimental
education of the children of the State to be provided for by their parents, as best they could.
Primary schools were gotten up in the different neighborhoods by the concentrated action of
its members, and a teacher employed, and paid by each parent at so much per capita for his
children. In these schools almost every Georgian--yes, almost every Southerner--commenced his
education. It was at these schools were mingled the sexes in pursuit of their A, B, C, and
the incidents occurring here became the cherished memories of after life. Many a man of eminence
has gone out from these schools with a better education with which to begin life and a conflict
with the world, than is obtained now at some of the institutions called colleges.

Young men without means, who had acquired sufficient of the rudiments of an English education,
but who desired to pursue their studies and complete an education to subserve the purposes
of the pursuit in life selected by them, frequently were the teachers in the primary schools.
From this class arose most of those men so distinguished in her earlier history. Some were
natives, and some were immigrants from other States, who sought a new field for their efforts,
and where to make their future homes. Such were William H. Crawford, Abram Baldwin, and many
others, whose names are now borne by the finest counties in the State--a monument to their
virtues, talents, and public services, erected by a grateful people.

These primitive schools made the children of every neighborhood familiar to each other, and
encouraged a homogeneous feeling in the rising population of the State. This sameness of education
and of sentiment created a public opinion more efficacious in directing and controlling public
morals than any statutory law, or its most efficient administration. It promoted an esprit
du corps throughout the country, and formed the basis of that chivalrous emprise so peculiarly
Southern.

The recollections of these school-days are full of little incidents confirmatory of these views.
I will relate one out of a thousand I might enumerate. A very pretty little girl of eight years,
full of life and spirit, had incurred, by some act of childish mischief, the penalty of the
switch--the only and universal means of correction in the country schools. She was the favorite
of a lad of twelve, who sat looking on, and listening to the questions propounded to his sweetheart,
and learning the decision of the teacher, which was announced thus: "Well, Mary, I must punish
you."

All eyes were directed to William. Deliberately he laid down his books, and, stepping quickly
up to the teacher, said, respectfully: "Don't strike her. Whip me. I'll take it for her," as
he arrested with his hand the uplifted switch. Every eye in that little log school-house brightened
with approbation, and, in a moment after, filled with tears, as the teacher laid down his rod
and said: "William, you are a noble boy, and, for your sake, I will excuse Mary." Ten years
after, Mary was the wife--the dutiful, loving, happy wife of William; and William, twenty years
after, was a member of the Legislature, and then a representative in Congress, (when it was
an honor to a gentleman to be such,) and afterwards was for years a Senator in the same body--one
of Georgia's noblest, proudest, and best men.

Can any one enumerate an instance where evil grew out of the early association of the sexes
at school? In the neighborhoods least populous, and where there were but few children, the
pedagogue usually divided the year into as many parts as he had pupils, and boarded around
with each family the number of days allotted to each child. If he was a man of family, the
united strength of the neighborhood assembled upon a certain day, and built for him a residence
contiguous to the school-house, which was erected in like manner.

These buildings were primitive indeed--consisting of poles cut from the forest, and, with no
additional preparation, notched up into a square pen, and floored and covered with boards split
from a forest-tree near at hand. It rarely required more than two days to complete the cabin--the
second being appropriated to the chimney, and the chinking and daubing; that is, filling the
interstices with billets of wood, and make these air-tight with clay thrown violently in, and
smoothed over with the hand. Such buildings constituted nine-tenths of the homes of the entire
country sixty years ago; and in such substitutes for houses were born the men who have moved
the Senate with their eloquence, and added dignity and power to the bench of the Supreme Court
of the nation, startled the world with their achievements upon the battle-field, and more than
one of them has filled the Presidential chair.

Men born and reared under such circumstances, receive impressions which they carry through
life, and their characters always discover the peculiarities incident to such birth and rearing--rough
and vigorous, bold and daring, and nobly independent, without polish or deceit, always sincere,
and always honest.

However much the intellect may be cultivated in youth--however much it may be distinguished
for great thoughts and wonderful attainments, still the peculiarities born of the forest cling
about it in all its roughness--a fit setting to the unpolished diamond of the soul.

The rural pursuits of the country, and the necessities of the isolated condition of a pioneer
population, which necessities are mainly supplied by ingenuity and perseverance on the part
of each, creates an independence and self-reliance which enter largely into the formation of
the general character. The institution of African slavery existing in the South, which came
with the very first, pioneer, and which was continually on the increase, added to this independence
the habit of command; and this, too, became a part of Southern character. The absolute control
of the slave, placed by habit and law in the will of the master, made it necessary to enact
laws for the protection of the slave against the tyrannical cruelties found in some natures;
but the public sentiment was in this, as in all other things, more potent than law. Their servile
dependence forbade resistance to any cruelty which might be imposed; but it excited the general
sympathy, and inspired, almost universally, a lenient humanity toward them.

They were mostly born members of the household, grew up with the children of each family, were
companions and playmates, and naturally an attachment was formed, which is always stronger
in the protecting than the protected party. The vocalization with pest of vertebrate, or there was ne'er have

The people of the State were becoming clamorous for the fulfilment of the contract between
the State and General Government for the removal of the Indians from the territory of the State,
and Troup was urged upon the voters as being favorable in the extreme to this policy, and also
as possessing the talents, will, and determination to effect this end. Finally the day of election
arrived. The representative men of the State were assembled. It was scarcely possible to find
hotel accommodations for the multitude. The judges of the different judicial districts, the
leading members of the Bar, men of fortune and leisure, the prominent members of the different
sects of the Christian Church, and especially the ministers of the gospel who were most prominent
and influential, were all there. The celebrated Jesse Mercer was a moving spirit amidst the
excited multitude, and Daniel Duffie, who, as a most intolerant Methodist, and an especial
hater of the Baptist Church and all Baptists, was there also, willing to lay down all ecclesiastical
prejudice, and go to heaven even with Jesse Mercer, because he was a Troup man.

The Senate came into the Representative chamber at noon, to effect, on joint ballot, the election
of Governor. The President of the Senate took his seat with the Speaker of the House, and in
obedience to law assumed the presidency of the assembled body. The members were ordered to
prepare their ballots to vote for the Governor of the State. The Secretary of the Senate called
the roll of the Senate, each man, as his name was called, moving up to the clerk's desk, and
depositing his ballot. The same routine was then gone through with on the part of the House,
when the hat (for a hat was used) containing the ballots was handed to the President of the
Senate, Thomas Stocks, of Greene County, who proceeded to count the ballots, and finding only
the proper number, commenced to call the name from each ballot. Pending this calling the silence
was painfully intense. Every place within the spacious hall, the gallery, the lobby, the committee-rooms,
and the embrasures of the windows were all filled to crushing repletion. And yet not a word
or sound, save the excited breathing of ardent men, disturbed the anxious silence of the hall.
One by one the ballots were called. There were 166 ballots, requiring 84 to elect. When 160
ballots were counted, each candidate had 80, and at this point the excitement was so painfully
intense that the President suspended the count, and, though it was chilly November, took from
his pocket his handkerchief, and wiped from his flushed face the streaming perspiration. While
this was progressing, a wag in the gallery sang out, "The darkest time of night is just before
day." This interruption was not noticed by the President, who called out "Troup!" then "Talbot!"
and again there was a momentary suspension. Then he called again, "Troup--Talbot!" "82--82,"
was whispered audibly through the entire hall. Then the call was resumed. "Troup!" "A tie,"
said more than a hundred voices. There remained but one ballot. The President turned the hat
up-side down, and the ballot fell upon the table. Looking down upon it, he called, at the top
of his voice, "Troup!" The scene that followed was indescribable. The two parties occupied
separate sides of the chamber. Those voting for Troup rose simultaneously from their seats,
and one wild shout seemed to lift the ceiling overhead. Again, with increased vim, was it given.
The lobby and the galleries joined in the wild shout. Members and spectators rushed into each
others' arms, kissed each other, wept, shouted, kicked over the desks, tumbled on the floor,
and for ten minutes this maddening excitement suspended the proceedings of the day. It was
useless for the presiding officer to command order, if, indeed, his feelings were sufficiently
under control to do so. When exhaustion had produced comparative silence, Duffie, with the
full brogue of the County Carlow upon his tongue, ejaculated: "O Lord, we thank Thee! The State
is redeemed from the rule of the Devil and John Clarke." Mercer waddled from the chamber, waving
his hat above his great bald head, and shouting "Glory, glory!" which he continued until out
of sight. General Blackshear, a most staid and grave old gentleman and a most sterling man,
rose from his seat, where he, through all this excitement, had sat silent, folded his arms
upon his breast, and, looking up, with tears streaming from his eyes, exclaimed: "Now, Lord,
I am ready to die!" Order was finally restored, and the state of the ballot stated, (Troup,
84; Talbot, 82,) when President Stocks proclaimed George M. Troup duly elected Governor of
the State of Georgia for the next three years.

This was the last election of a Governor by the Legislature. The party of Clarke demanded that
the election should be given to the people. This was done, and in 1825, Troup was re-elected
over Clarke by a majority of some seven hundred votes. It was during this last contest that
the violence and virulence of party reached its acme, and pervaded every family, creating animosities
which neither time nor reflection ever healed.

During the administration of Troup, a contest arose as to the true western boundary of the
State, and the right of the State to the territory occupied by a portion of the Creek tribe
of Indians. In the difficulty arising out of the sale by the Legislature of the lands belonging
to the State bordering upon the Mississippi River, a compromise was effected by Congress with
the company purchasing, and Georgia had sold to the United States her claim to all the lands
in the original grant to General Oglethorpe and others by the English Government, west of the
Chattahoochee River. A part of the consideration was that the United States should, at a convenient
time, and for the benefit of Georgia, extinguish the title of the Indians, and remove them
from the territory occupied by them, east of the Chattahoochee River, to a certain point upon
that stream; and from this point, east of a line to run from it, directly to a point called
Neckey Jack, on the Tennessee River. The war of 1812 with Great Britain found the Creek or
Alabama portion of this tribe of Indians allies of England. They were by that war conquered,
and their territory wrested from them. Those of the tribe under the influence of the celebrated
chief William McIntosh remained friendly to the United States, and were active in assisting
in the conquest of their hostile brethren. The conquered Indians were removed from their territory
and homes, into the territory east of Line Creek, which was made the western boundary of the
Creek Nation's territory. Many of them came into the territory claimed by Georgia as her domain.

This war was a war of the Republican party of the United States, and the State of Georgia being
almost unanimously Republican, her people felt it would be unpatriotic, at this juncture, to
demand of the Government the fulfilment of her obligations in removing the Indians from her
soil. The expenses of the war were onerous, and felt as a heavy burden by the people, and one
which was incurred by Republican policy. That party felt that it was its duty to liquidate
this war debt as speedily as possible. To this end the sale of those conquered lands would
greatly contribute; relieving, at the same time, the people to some extent, from the heavy
taxation they had borne during the progress of the war. Consequently, they had not pressed
the fulfilment of this contract upon the Government. But now the war debt had been liquidated--the
United States treasury was overflowing with surplus treasure--Indian tribes were being removed
by the purchase of their lands in the northwest, and a tide of population pouring in upon these
lands, and threatening a powerful political preponderance in opposition to Southern policy
and Southern interests. Under these circumstances, and the recommendation of Governor Troup,
the Legislature of the State, by joint resolution and memorial to Congress, demanded the fulfilment
of the contract on the part of the United States, and the immediate removal of the Indians.

John Quincy Adams was at that time President of the United States, and, as he had ever been,
was keenly alive to Northern interests and to Federal views. Though professing to be Republican
in political faith, he arrayed all his influence in opposition to the rights of the States.
In this matter he gave the cold shoulder to Georgia. He did not recommend a repudiation of
the contract, but interposed every delay possible to its consummation. After some time, commissioners
were appointed to negotiate a treaty with the Indians for the purchase of their claim to the
lands within the boundaries established by the sale to the United States--or so much thereof
as was in possession of the Creek tribe. To this there was very serious opposition, not only
from that portion of the tribe which formerly allied themselves to Great Britain, but from
missionaries found in the Cherokee country, and from Colonel John Crowell, who was United States
agent for the Creek Indians. These Indians were controlled by their chief, Hopothlayohola,
a man of rare abilities and great daring. He was a powerful speaker, fluent as a fountain,
and extremely vigorous in his expressions: his imagery was original and beautiful, apposite
and illustrative; and his words and manner passionate to wildness. To all this he added the
ferocity of his savage nature.

Crowell was an especial friend of Governor Clarke, and was influenced by his party feelings
of hatred to Troup--in his opposition to a treaty, openly declaring that Georgia should never
acquire the land while Troup was Governor. He was an unscrupulous man, of questionable morals,
and vindictive as a snake.

The persevering energy of Troup, however, prevailed. A treaty was negotiated, and signed by
Crowell, as agent, and a number of the chiefs headed by McIntosh. No sooner was this done,
than Crowell, with a number of chiefs, hurried to Washington to protest against the ratification
and execution of the treaty, charging the United States commissioners with fraud in the negotiation,
under the influence of Troup, prompted by W. H. Crawford and friends. The fraud charged was
in giving presents to the chiefs, and a couple of reservations of land to McIntosh--one where
he resided, and the other around and including the famous Sulphur Spring, known as the Indian
Spring, in Butts County.

This habit of giving presents to the chiefs when negotiating treaties has always been the custom
of the Government. They expect it; it is a part of the consideration paid for the treaty of
sale, for they are universally the vendors of territory and the negotiators of treaties for
their tribes. This charge was simply a subterfuge, and one that was known would be influential
with the mawkish philanthropists of the North, Mr. Adams, and the senators and representatives
from New England. Upon the assumption of fraud, based upon these charges alone, the treaty
was set aside by the action of the President and Cabinet alone; and by the same authority a
new one made, with a change of boundary, involving a loss of a portion of territory belonging
to Georgia under the stipulations of the contract between the State and United States. The
previous or first treaty had been submitted to the United States Senate, and duly ratified,
thereby becoming a law, under which Georgia claimed vested rights.

It was under these trying circumstances that the stern and determined character of Troup displayed
itself. Holding firmly to the doctrine of State rights, he notified the President that he should
disregard the latter treaty, and proceed to take possession of the territory under the stipulations
of the former one. Upon the receipt of this information, General Gaines was ordered to Georgia
to take command of the troops stationed along the frontier of the State, and any additional
troops which might be ordered to this point, with orders to protect the Indians, and prohibit
taking possession of the territory, as contemplated by Governor Troup. A correspondence ensued
between General Gaines and Governor Troup of a most angry character. It terminated with an
order to General Gaines to forbear all further communication with the Government of Georgia.
This was notified to the President, (if my memory is correct, for I write from memory,) in
these terms:

  "JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, President of the United States:

  "SIR: I have ordered General Gaines to forbear all further communication
  with this Government. Should he presume to infringe
  this order, I will send your major-general by brevet home to you in
  irons.      GEORGE M. TROUP, Governor of Georgia."

The surveyors previously appointed by the Legislature were directed to be on the ground, in
defiance of United States authority, on the first day of September succeeding, and at sunrise
to commence the work of surveying the lands. A collision was anticipated as certain between
the troops of the United States and the authorities of Georgia. But there was a difficulty
in the way not previously contemplated. Twiggs and McIntosh were native Georgians. Clinch was
a North Carolinian, but was a resident of Florida. Zachary Taylor was the lieutenant-colonel
of Clinch's regiment. He was a Virginian by birth, but resided in Mississippi. All were Southern
men in feeling, as well as by birth, and all Jeffersonian Republicans, politically. McIntosh
and Twiggs were fanatical in their devotion to the State of their birth. The ancestors of both
were among the first settlers, and both were identified with her history. The three wrote a
joint letter to the President, tendering their commissions, if ordered to take arms against
Georgia. This letter was placed in the hands of one who was influential with Mr. Adams, to
be delivered immediately after the order should be issued to General Gaines to prevent by force
of arms the survey ordered by Governor Troup. Troup had classified the militia, and signified
his intention to carry out, if necessary, the first-negotiated treaty, by force of arms, as
the law of the land.

It was, unquestionably, the prudence of this friend which prevented a collision. He communicated
with Mr. Adams confidentially, and implored him not to issue the order. He assured him that
a collision was inevitable if he did, and caused him to pause and consult his advisers, who
declared their conviction that the first treaty was the law of the land, and that Georgia held
vested rights under it. In obedience to this advice, Mr. Adams made no further effort to prevent
the action of Georgia, and the lands were surveyed and disposed of by the State, under and
according to the terms of the first treaty, and she retains a large strip of territory that
would have been lost to her under the last treaty. My information of these facts was derived
from Twiggs, Clinch, and Henry Clay. Who the friend was to whom the letter was intrusted, I
never knew. I mentioned to Mr. Clay the facts, and he stated that they were true, but no knowledge
of them ever came to him until the expiration of Mr. Adams' Administration. General Taylor
stated to me that long after these events had transpired, and after the resignation of Colonel
Clinch, General Twiggs had made the communication to him. As nearly as I can remember, Twiggs
made the statement to me in the language I have used here. On returning from the ratification
meeting, at Canton, of the nomination of Mr. Clay for the Presidency, in 1844, before we reached
Baltimore, I was in a carriage with General Clinch and Senator Barrow, of Louisiana, and stated
these facts, and Clinch verified them.

General Gaines was, of all men, the most unfit for a position like that in which he was placed.
He was a good fighter, a chivalrous, brave man; but he was weak and vain, and without tact
or discretion. His intentions were, at all times, pure, but want of judgment frequently placed
him in unpleasant positions. The condition of the minds of the people of Georgia, at this time,
was such, that very little was necessary to excite them to acts of open strife, and had Mr.
Adams been less considerate than he was, there is now no telling what would have been the consequence.
He was extremely unpopular at the South, and this, added to the inflamed condition of public
opinion there, would assuredly have brought on a collision. Had it come, it might have resulted
in a triumph of Southern principles, which, at a later day, and under less auspicious circumstances,
struggled for existence, only to be crushed perhaps forever.

It was universally the wish of the people of Georgia to have possession of the land properly
belonging to her, and but for their factious divisions, the hazards of a conflict between the
troops of the United States and those of Georgia would have been more imminent. It was believed
by both these factions, that whoever should, as Governor of the State, succeed in obtaining
these lands, would thereby be rendered eminently popular, and secure to his faction the ascendency
in the State for all time. The faction supporting Clarke believed he would certainly triumph
in the coming contest before the people, and assumed to believe that then the matter of acquisition
would be easy, as the Administration of Mr. Adams supposed that faction could, by that means,
be brought into the support of the party now being formed about it. Clarke and many of his
leading friends were coquetting with the Administration. He was--as was his brother-in-law,
Duncan G. Campbell--a strong friend of Mr. Calhoun, who was then the Vice-President. National
parties were inchoate, and many politicians were chary of choosing, and seemed to wait for
the development of coming events, ere they gave shape and direction to their future courses.
It was certain that Mr. Clay was identified with the American System, and that would, in a
great degree, be the leading policy of the Administration. Mr. Calhoun, when Secretary of War,
under Mr. Monroe, had made a strong report in favor of internal improvements by the General
Government, within the limits of the States, and, while a member of Congress, had made an equally
strong one in favor of a national bank. These were two of the prominent features of the American
system, and it was generally believed that this policy would be too popular to combat. It had
originated during the Administration of Monroe, and if it had the opposition of any member
of his Cabinet, it was unknown to the country. Mr. Crawford and Mr. Calhoun, as well as Mr.
Adams, were members of that Cabinet, and were all, in some degree, committed to this policy;
for Mr. Crawford, as a Senator from Georgia, during the Administration of Mr. Madison, had
sustained the doctrine of the constitutionality and the policy of a national bank, in one of
the very ablest speeches ever made upon the subject, saying everything which could or can be
said in favor of such a government financial agent, and refuting every objection of its opponents.
From this speech is derived every argument and every idea of both the reports of Calhoun and
McDuffie, which were heralded to the nation as greater even than that of Mr. Dallas, who, with
Robert Morris, may be said to be the fathers of this institution. Mr. Clay had, in one of his
ablest speeches, opposed the bank at a former time, and his change of opinion was now well known.

It was very well understood that the coming men were Clay, Jackson, and Calhoun. Clarke and
his friends were ardent supporters of Calhoun, and it was thought they had won the favor of
the Administration. Mr. Clay was strongly opposed to the execution of the old treaty, and had,
by this means, drawn upon himself the opposition of the Crawford, or Troup party. These facts
show the condition of public opinion in the State, and conclusively establish the fact, that
but for this division of the people, and the check held by this upon the action of the masses
and their leaders, fearful consequences would assuredly have ensued.

The reasons influencing the joint action of Mr. Adams and Mr. Clay in opposition to the execution
of the old treaty were very different. Mr. Clay was honest and patriotic. He had no ulterior
views to subserve. His policy was national. He desired the prosperity and advancement of his
country to greatness and power among the nations of the earth. His fame was that of the nation;
already it was identified with it. His ambition was a noble and a grand one. He wished his
name identified with his acts, and these to constitute the fame and glory of the nation. He
ever felt what subsequently he so nobly expressed, "That he would rather be right than be President."
He had no petty selfishness--no pitiful revenges to exhaust with the hand of power--no contemptible
motives for elevating or advancing the interests of one section of his country by oppressing
another. "All his aims were his country's," and his whole country's. He desired that every
act of that country should bear the broadest light, and challenge the closest and most searching
scrutiny; that each should be a new and brighter gem in the diadem of her glory, and that her
magnanimity should be most conspicuous in her transactions with the weakest. This he especially
desired, and labored to effect, in all her transactions with the Indians. He viewed these as
the primitive proprietors of the soil, and possessors of the entire country. He knew they were
fading away before a civilization they were by nature incapacitated to emulate, and this, he
felt, was in obedience to the inexorable laws of Divine Providence; and, in the wonderfully
capacious compassion of his nature, he desired, in the accomplishment of this fate, that no
act of national injustice to them should stain the nation's escutcheon, and determined to signalize
this desire in every act of his when giving form and shape to national policy. He had generously
lent a listening ear to the protests of the chiefs, seconded by that of their agent, and sincerely
believed the treaty had been effected by fraud, and was wrong and oppressive, and, therefore,
he opposed its execution, and was the main instrument in forming a new one. The draft of this
was from his own pen, and he was solicitous that it should supersede the old one, as an expression
of the Indians' desire.

Mr. Adams was, equally with Mr. Clay, opposed to the treaty as ratified, though, as was his
constitutional duty, he had sent the instrument for the action of the Senate. In heart he was
opposed to any treaty which would remove the aborigines from this territory at this time, and,
in consequence of the action of Georgia, it was anticipated that, at no very distant day, the
entire Indian population east of the Mississippi River, in the South, would be removed, unless
some policy of the Government should be adopted which would prevent it; and those of the North,
who felt desirous of crippling the territorial progress of the South, and, of consequence,
her augmentation of population, supposed the most effectual means of accomplishing this would
be to educate and Christianize the Indian. To do this, they insisted he must remain upon the
territory he now occupied. This would bring him into immediate contact with the civilized white,
where he could be most readily approached by missionaries and schoolmasters, and be instructed
by the force of example. At the same time, he was to remain under the sole protection of the
United States Government, without any of the privileges of civil government to be exercised
as a citizen of the United States or the State upon whose soil he was located. This was ennobled
as the sentiment of Christian benevolence, while its real intention was to withhold the land
from the occupancy of the people of Georgia, and in so much retard the growth and increase
of the white population of the State. To carry out this scheme, missionary establishments sprang
up among the Indians in every part of the South, but especially within the limits of the State
of Georgia, filled with Northern fanatics, who employed themselves most actively in prejudicing
the minds of the savages against the people who were their neighbors, and preparing them to
refuse to treat for the sale of any of their territory.

It has ever been the practice of the Puritan to propagate the vilest heresies, and for the
vilest purposes, under the name of philanthropy and religion. It has burned its enemy at the
stake, as, assembled around, they sang psalms, and sanctified the vilest cruelties with the
name of God's vengeance. It was their great prototype, Cotton Mather, who blasphemously proclaimed,
after the most inhuman massacre of several hundred Indians, that they, the Puritans of Massachusetts,
"had sent, as a savory scent to the nostrils of God, two hundred or more of the reeking souls
of the godless heathen."

This, ostensibly, was deemed a pious act, and a discharge of a pious duty, when, in truth,
the only motive was to take his home and country, and appropriate it to their own people. It
seems almost impossible to the race to come squarely up to truth and honesty, in word or act,
in any transaction, as a man or as a people. Sinister and subtle, expediency, and not principle,
seems to be their universal rule of action. Cold and passionless, incapable of generous emotions,
he is necessarily vindictive and cruel. Patient and persevering, bigoted and selfish, eschewing
as a crime an honorable resentment, he creeps to his ends like a serpent, with all his cunning
and all his venom.

John Quincy Adams, in his nature, was much more like his mother than his father. His features
were those of his mother, and the cold, persevering hatred of his nature was hers. From his
boyhood he was in the habit of recording, for future use, the most confidential conversations
of his friends, as also all that incautiously fell from an occasional interview with those
less intimate. Had this been done for future reference only to establish facts in his own mind,
there could have been no objection to the act; but this was not the motive. These memoranda
were to rise up in vengeance when necessary to gratify his spleen or vengeance. He was naturally
suspicious. He gave no man his confidence, and won the friendship of no one. Malignant and
unforgiving, he watched his opportunity, and never failed to gratify his revengeful nature,
whenever his victim was in his power. The furtive wariness of his small gray eye, his pinched
nose, receding forehead, and thin, compressed lips, indicated the malignant nature of his soul.
Unfaithful to friends, and only constant in selfishness--unconscious of obligation, and ungrateful
for favors--fanatical only in hatred--pretending to religious morality, yet pursuing unceasingly,
with merciless revenge, those whom he supposed to be his enemies, he combined all the elements
of Puritan bigotry and Puritan hate in devilish intensity. He deserted the Federal party in
their greatest need, and meanly betrayed them to Mr. Jefferson, whom, from his boyhood, he
had hated and reviled in doggerel rhymes and the bitterest prose his genius could suggest.

The conduct of Mr. Adams, after he had been President, as the representative of Massachusetts
in Congress, is the best evidence of the motives which influenced his conduct in the matter
of these two treaties. He never lost an opportunity to assail the interests and the institutions
of the South. He hated her, and to him, more than to any other, is due the conduct of the Northern
people toward the South which precipitated the late war, and has destroyed the harmony once
existing between the people.

His father had been repudiated by the South for a more trusted son of her own. This was a treasured
hatred; and when he shared his father's fate, this became the pervading essence of his nature.

He returned to Congress, after his defeat for the Presidency, for no other purpose than to
give shape and direction to a sentiment which he felt must ultimately result in her ruin, and
to accomplish this he was more than willing to hazard that of the Government. He felt, should
this follow, his own people would be in a condition to dictate and control a government of
their own creation, and which should embody their peculiar views, rather than the pure and
unselfish principles enunciated in the Declaration of Independence, and preserved in the Constitution
of the United States.

The sagacity of George M. Troup was the first to discover this in his conduct as President,
and to sound the alarm as Governor of Georgia. He came directly in contact with him, and determined
he should be defeated in one of his means for injury to the South. Troup knew and felt the
right was with him, and maintained it with the honest boldness of a true man. He triumphed,
and the doctrine of State rights was rescued from a fatally aimed blow, and reaffirmed, gave
renewed popularity and strength to its supporters. The election of General Jackson soon after
followed, and, as the embodiment of the principle, rallied around him its supporters from every
section. With these, and his immense popularity personally, he scotched, for a time, the Puritan
snake; but, true to its instincts, it struggled to bite, though its head was off.

Mr. Adams saw in Troup a strong and uncompromising foe; he knew, too, the right was with him,
and that if pushed to extremities the result would be damaging to his fame, as having, in persevering
for the wrong, destroyed the Government, and at a time, too, when every benefit from such destruction
would inure to the South. Under the circumstances his course was taken: he dared not consult
or trust Mr. Clay with the real motives which influenced him to yield, and made a virtue of
patriotism and magnanimity which cloaked his pusillanimity, and shielded from public view his
envenomed chagrin.

It was doubtless this triumph which secured the second election of Troup. Personally he was
unpopular with the masses. His rearing had been in polished society, and though he was in principle
a democrat, in his feelings, bearing, and associations he was an aristocrat. He accorded equality
to all under the law and in political privilege, but he chose to select his associates, and
admitted none to the familiarity of intimacy but men of high breeding and unquestioned honor.
In many things he was peculiar and somewhat eccentric. In dress, especially so--often appearing
in midwinter in light, summer apparel; and again, in summer, with a winter cloak wrapped carefully
about him. When he appeared first before the assembled Legislature, and many of the first citizens
of the State, to take the oath of office, it was a raw, cold day in November; his dress was
a round jacket of coarse cotton, black cassimere vest, yellow nankeen pantaloons, silk hose,
and dancing-pumps, with a large-rimmed white hat, well worn. In his address, which was short
and most beautiful, he made his hat conspicuous by holding it in his right hand, and waving
it with every gesture. In person, he was below the middle size, slender, though finely formed;
his hair was red, and his eyes intensely blue and deeply set beneath a heavy brow; his nose
was prominent and aquiline; his mouth, the great feature of his face, was Grecian in mould,
with flexible lips, which, while in repose, seemed to pout. His rabid opposition to those engaged
in the Yazoo frauds, and his hatred for those who defended it, made him extremely obnoxious
to them, and prompted Dooly to say: "Nature had formed his mouth expressly to say, 'Yazoo.'"
Its play, when speaking, was tremulous, with a nervous twitching, which gave an agitated intonation
to his words very effective.

The form of his head, and especially his forehead, indicated an imaginative mind, while the
lines of his face marked deep thought. He was strictly honest in everything; was opposed to
anything which wore the appearance of courting public favor, or seemed like a desire for office.
His private life was exemplary, kind, and indulgent to his children and servants, and full
of charity; severe upon nothing but the assumptions of folly, and the wickedness of purpose
in the dishonest heart. In every relation of life he discharged its duties conscientiously,
and was the enemy only of the vicious and wicked. He continued to reside upon his plantation
in Lawrence County with his slaves, carefully providing for their every want until his death.
He had attained the patriarchal age of threescore years and ten, and sank to rest in the solitude
of his forest-home, peacefully and piously, leaving no enemies, and all the people of his State
to mourn him.

The remarkable excitement of the political contest between Troup and Clarke had the effect
of stimulating the ambition of the young men of education throughout the State for political
distinction. For some time anterior to this period, all seemed content to permit those who
had been the active politicians in the Republican struggle with the Federal party to fill all
the offices of distinction in the State without opposition. It would have been considered presumptuous
in the extreme for any young man, whatever his abilities, to have offered himself as a candidate
for Congress in opposition to Mr. Forsyth, R.H. Wild, Thomas W. Cobb, Edward F. Tatnal, and
men of like age and political faith. The members of Congress were elected by general ticket;
and the selection of candidates was not by a convention of the people or party. The names of
candidates were generally recommended by influential parties, and their consent to become candidates
obtained through solicitations addressed to them, and then published to the people. The State
was so unanimous in political sentiment, that for many years no opposition to the Republican
party was thought of.

But now parties were organizing upon principles, or rather policies, entirely new; there was
a fusion of the old elements of party, and Federalists and Republicans were side by side in
this new organization. Men who had been under the ban, for opinion's sake, were coming into
public view and public favor, and disclosing great abilities. At the head of these was John
McPherson Berrien, who, to the end of his life, was so distinguished in the councils of the
nation. At the same time, in every part of the State, young men were rising up as men of promise
for talent and usefulness. These men arrayed themselves with either of the two parties, as
inclination or interest prompted. Active and assiduous, they were soon prominent before the
people, and a new era was commencing. With the election of John Quincy Adams, the State was
in a blaze and politics a furor. Opposition immediately commenced to the leading measures of
the Administration, and the Legislature of 1825 was filled with young men of talent, who were
enthusiastic and fierce in their sentiments and feelings. They had been divided as partisans
of Troup and Clarke, and met as antagonists in the Legislature; but really without any defined
policy in opposition to that of the administration of the General Government of the nation.
A suspicion filled every one that this policy was disastrous to Southern interests, and sectional
in its character, although designated as national.

Few men of the South had given much attention to the effect a tariff for revenue had upon the
commercial and manufacturing interests of the North. The war with England had created a debt,
and this tariff had been imposed solely for the purpose of securing, not only a sufficient
revenue for the current necessities of the Government, but a surplus, which should in a short
time liquidate the public debt. It was sufficient to afford protection to the manufacturing
interests of the North, to increase this into a formidable revenue, and to enlist a national
party in its support. It was now, when the public debt was liquidated, that another reason
was necessary for continuing a policy which had grown up from the necessities of the nation--consequently
it was assumed to be a national policy to promote national independence, and protection was
claimed for national industry against European competition. This policy in the Government would
encourage extravagance, waste, and corruption--such a bane to republics--because it would create
an immense surplus in the national treasury, unless some scheme for its expenditure could be
devised which should seem to promote the national interest. To this end, the party of the Administration
claimed a constitutional power in Congress to carry on a system of internal improvements; and
heavy appropriations were made for this purpose, not only absorbing the surplus revenue, but
creating a necessity for more--and this necessity was an excuse for increasing the tariff.

The Bank of the United States was the depository of the moneys of the nation and her disbursing
agent. The constitutionality of this institution had been a mooted question from the day it
was first proposed by Robert Morris. Mr. Madison, who was a Republican, had at one time vetoed
it; at another, approved it. Mr. Crawford, a most inveterate States-rights man and strict constructionist
of the Constitution, had uniformly supported it. Mr. Clay had both supported and opposed it.
The question was finally adjudicated by the Supreme Court, and, so far as that decision could
make it, was decided to be constitutional. This, however, did not satisfy the Republican or
States-rights party; a large majority of whom always insisted upon its unconstitutionality.
At the time of its creation, a necessity existed for some such institution, to aid the Government
in its financial operations, and at the time of the renewal of its charter the Government had
just emerged from a war; every State was creating banks, and the country was flooded with an
irredeemable and worthless currency, disturbing commerce, unsettling values, and embarrassing
the Government. A power was wanted somewhere to control these State banks, and to give a redeemable
and uniform currency to the country.

The State banks had proved destructive to the public interest; with no power to restrain their
issues except that imposed by their charters and the honesty of their officers--a frail security
for the public, as experience had attested. The example of Washington was pleaded by the advocates
of the bank. At the very outset it had been opposed for want of constitutionality. Washington
had doubted it, and submitted the question to two of his Cabinet--Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Hamilton.
They were divided in opinion--Mr. Jefferson opposing, and Mr. Hamilton sustaining the constitutionality
of the measure. The opinion and argument of Hamilton prevailed, and the act creating a bank
received the Executive approval.

It answered admirably the object of its creation, and the Republican party (then in embryo)
acquiesced. Indeed, at this time, there could scarcely be said to be a party separate from
the Government. Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Jefferson were the leaders of the parties which divided
the people upon the adoption of the Constitution, and these parties, though at this time inchoate,
were concreting about these two wonderful men. Upon the renewal of the charter of the United
States Bank, during the Administration of Mr. Madison, the Republican party again mooted its
constitutionality; but its undisputed usefulness had won for it immense popularity, and there
were many who, though acting with the Republicans, were willing (as Washington had approved
it, and the Supreme Court had pronounced it constitutional) to view the question as settled,
and vote to renew the charter.

It was subsequent to the veto of Mr. Madison (when he had reconsidered his action, and recommended
the re-chartering of the bank,) that debates ensued, in which the question was exhausted. In
these debates, Mr. Crawford, Mr. Clay, Felix Grundy, William B. Giles, and Mr. Calhoun led.
They were continued through several sessions, up to 1816, when they ultimated in the chartering
of the last bank of the United States. This charter expired during the Administration of General
Jackson, and by him the bank was finally crushed.

Three great measures constituted what was then termed the American System--the United States
Bank, a protective tariff, and internal improvements within the States by the General Government.
An opposition to this party was formed at the very outset of the Adams Administration. This
opposition denied the constitutional power of Congress to create or sustain either.

The South, at the commencement of this opposition, was almost alone. The North was a unit in
its support of the Administration, because its policy was vital to her interests. The West,
influenced by Mr. Clay, was greatly in the majority in its support. The Southern opposition
seemed almost hopeless; and to this cause may, in a great degree, be ascribed the bringing
forth to public view the transcendent abilities of the young men aspiring for fame in Georgia,
and in the South generally. McDuffie, Hamilton, Holmes, and Waddy Thompson, of South Carolina;
Colquitt, Cobb, Toombs, Stephens, Johnson, Nesbit, and John P. King, of Georgia; Wise, Bocock,
Hunter, Summers, Rives, and others of Virginia; Mangum, Badger, and Graham, of North Carolina;
Bell, Foster, Peyton, Nicholson, and James K. Polk, of Tennessee; King and Lewis, of Alabama;
Porter, Johnston, White, and Barrow, of Louisiana; Ashley, Johnson, and Sevier, of Arkansas;
Chase, Pugh, Pendleton, and Lytell, of Ohio; and Douglas, Trumbull, and Lincoln, of Illinois,
were all men of sterling talent, and were about equally divided in political sentiment. Kentucky
had Tom and Humphrey Marshall, Crittenden, Menifer, Letcher, Breckinridge, and Preston.

General Jackson was now the avowed candidate of the States-rights party, which soon after assumed
the name of Democratic, and his political principles and great personal popularity were not
only dividing the West, but the Middle States, and even those of New England.

During the entire administration of Adams, there was a majority in Congress supporting his
policy. It was then and there that the great battle for supremacy was fought. Berrien and Forsyth,
from Georgia, in the Senate; McDuffie and Preston, from South Carolina; Cass, from Michigan,
and Van Buren and Silas Wright, from New York--all giants in intellect. But there were Webster
and John Davis, from Massachusetts, George Evans, from Maine, and others of minor powers, but
yet great men. Between these great minds the conflict was stupendous. Every means were put
into requisition to sustain the Administration and its policy, but all were unavailing--General
Jackson was elected by an overwhelming majority. Mr. Clay was immediately returned by Kentucky
to the Senate, and organized an opposition upon the policy of the late Administration, led
on by himself and Webster. The memory of those days, and the men who made them memorable, flits
vividly before me; but I am not writing a history, and can attempt no order, but shall write
on as these memories of men and events shall seem to me most interesting in their character
to the general reader.

General Jackson was one of those rare creations of nature which appear at long intervals, to
astonish and delight mankind. It seems to be settled in the public mind that he was born in
South Carolina; but there is no certainty of the fact. His early life was very obscure, and
he himself was uncertain of his birth-place, though he believed it was South Carolina. He remembered
the removal of his family from South Carolina, and many of the incidents of the war of the
Revolution transpiring there; but more especially those occurring in North Carolina, to which
the family removed. Judge Alexander Porter, of Louisiana, was an Irishman, and from the neighborhood
where were born and reared the parents of Jackson. His own father was brutally executed at
Vinegar Hill, by sentence of a drum-head court martial, in 1798, and his family proscribed
by the British Government. With his uncle, the Rowans, the Jacksons, and some others, he emigrated
to America, and settled at Nashville, Tennessee. The Jacksons were of the same family, and
distantly connected with General Jackson. Great intimacy existed between this family and General
Jackson for many years.

Judge Porter, of whom I shall hereafter have something to say, visited Europe a short time
before his death, and made diligent search into the history of the Jackson family, without
ascertaining anything positively: he learned enough to satisfy his own mind that Andrew Jackson
was born in Ireland, and brought to the United States by his parents when only two years old.
This was also the opinion of Thomas Crutcher, who came with General Jackson to Nashville, and
it was also the opinion of Dr. Boyd McNary and his elder brother, Judge McNary, who believed
he was four years older than he supposed himself to be.

The McNarys came with him from North Carolina. On the trip a difficulty occurred between Boyd
McNary and Jackson, which never was reconciled--both dying in extreme old age. Boyd McNary
stopped at Lexington and read medicine, forming there the acquaintance of Mr. Clay and Felix
Grundy. The intimacy which sprang up between Clay and McNary was as ardent and imperishable
as the hatred between himself and Jackson, enduring until death. Jackson was enterprising and
eminently self-reliant; in all matters pertaining to himself, he was his own counsellor; he
advised with no man; cool and quick in thought, he seemed to leap to conclusions, and never
went back from them. An anecdote relative to his parting from his mother in his outset in life,
illustrates this as prominent in the attributes of his nature at that time. The writer heard
him narrate this after his return from Washington, when his last term in the Presidential office
had expired.

When about to emigrate to Tennessee, the family were residing in the neighborhood of Greensboro,
North Carolina.

"I had," said he, "contemplated this step for some months, and had made my arrangements to
do so, and at length had obtained my mother's consent to it. All my worldly goods were a few
dollars in my purse, some clothes in my saddle-bags, a pretty good horse, saddle, and bridle.
The country to which I was going was comparatively a wilderness, and the trip a long one, beset
by many difficulties, especially from the Indians. I felt, and so did my mother, that we were
parting forever. I knew she would not recall her promise; there was too much spunk in her for
that, and this caused me to linger a day or two longer than I had intended.

"But the time came for the painful parting. My mother was a little, dumpy, red-headed Irish
woman. 'Well, mother, I am ready to leave, and I must say farewell.' She took my hand, and
pressing it, said, 'Farewell,' and her emotion choked her.

"Kissing at meetings and partings in that day was not so common as now. I turned from her and
walked rapidly to my horse.

"As I was mounting him, she came out of the cabin wiping her eyes with her apron, and came
to the getting-over place at the fence. 'Andy,' said she, (she always called me Andy,) 'you
are going to a new country, and among a rough people; you will have to depend on yourself and
cut your own way through the world. I have nothing to give you but a mother's advice. Never
tell a lie, nor take what is not your own, nor sue anybody for slander or assault and battery.
Always settle them cases yourself!' I promised, and I have tried to keep that promise. I rode
off some two hundred yards, to a turn in the path, and looked back--she was still standing
at the fence and wiping her eyes. I never saw her after that." Those who knew him best will
testify to his fidelity to this last promise made his mother.

The strong common sense and unbending will of Jackson soon made him conspicuous in his new
home, and very soon he was in active practice as a lawyer. His prominence was such, that during
the last year of the last term of General Washington's Administration, a vacancy occurring
in the United States Senate from Tennessee, General Jackson was appointed to fill it. He was
occupying this seat when General Washington retired from the Presidency, and, with William
B. Giles, of Virginia, voted against a resolution of thanks tendered by Congress to Washington,
for his services to the country. For this vote he gave no reason at the time; and if he ever
did, it has escaped my knowledge.

The career of General Jackson, as a public man, is so well known, that it is not my purpose
to review it in this place; but many incidents of his private history have come to my knowledge
from an association with those who were intimate with him, from his first arrival in Tennessee.
These, or so many of them as I deem of interest enough to the public, I propose to relate.

Jackson was a restless and enterprising man, embarking in many schemes for the accumulation
of fortune, not usually resorted to by professional men, or men engaged in public matters.
In business he was cautious. He was a remarkable judge of human character, and rarely gave
his confidence to untried men. Notwithstanding the impetuosity of his nature, upon occasion
he could be as cool and as calculating as a Yankee. The result was, that though he had many
partners in the various pursuits he at different times resorted to, he rarely had any pecuniary
difficulty with any of them. He was in the habit of trading with the low country, that is,
with the inhabitants of Mississippi and Louisiana.

Many will remember the charge brought against him pending his candidacy for the Presidency,
of having been, in early life, a negro-trader, or dealer in slaves. This charge was strictly
true, though abundantly disproved by the oaths of some, and even by the certificate of his
principal partner. Jackson had a small store, or trading establishment, at Bruinsburgh, near
the mouth of the Bayou Pierre, in Claiborne County, Mississippi. It was at this point he received
the negroes, purchased by his partner at Nashville, and sold them to the planters of the neighborhood.
Sometimes, when the price was better, or the sales were quicker, he carried them to Louisiana.
This, however, he soon declined; because, under the laws of Louisiana, he was obliged to guarantee
the health and character of the slave he sold.

On one occasion he sold an unsound negro to a planter in the parish of West Feliciana, and,
upon his guarantee, was sued and held to bail to answer. In this case he was compelled to refund
the purchase-money, with damages. He went back upon his partner, and compelled him to share
the loss. This caused a breach between them, which was never healed. This is the only instance
which ever came to my knowledge of strife with a partner. He was close to his interest, and
spared no means to protect it.

It was during the period of his commercial enterprise in Mississippi that he formed the acquaintance
of the Green family. This family was among the very first Americans who settled in the State.
Thomas M. Green and Abner Green were young men at the time, though both were men of family.
To both of them Jackson, at different times, sold negroes, and the writer now has bills of
sale for negroes sold to Abner Green, in the handwriting of Jackson, bearing his signature,
written, as it always was, in large and bold characters, extending quite half across the sheet.
At this store, which stood immediately upon the bank of the Mississippi, there was a race-track,
for quarter-races, (a sport Jackson was then very fond of,) and many an anecdote was rife,
forty years ago, in the neighborhood, of the skill of the old hero in pitting a cock or turning
a quarter-horse.

This spot has become classic ground. It was here Aaron Burr was first arrested by Cowles Mead,
then acting as Governor of the Territory of Mississippi, and from whom he made his escape,
and it was at this point that Grant crossed his army when advancing against Vicksburg. It is
a beautiful plateau of land, of some two thousand acres, immediately below the mouth of the
Bayou Pierre, and bordered by very high and abrupt cliffs, which belong to the same range of
hills that approach the river's margin at Vicksburg, Grand Gulf, Rodney, Natchez, and Bayou
Sara. At this point they attain the height of three hundred feet, and are almost perpendicular.
The summit is attained by a circuitous road cut through the cliffs, and this is the summit
level of the surrounding country.

This plateau of land, where once stood the little village of Bruinsburgh, has long been a cotton
plantation, and a most valuable one it was before the late war. A deep, and, to an army, impassable
swamp borders it below, and the same is the case above the Bayou Pierre. To land an army at
such a place, when its only means of marching upon the country was through this narrow cut,
of about one hundred feet in width, with high, precipitous sides, forming a complete defile
for half a mile, and where five thousand men could have made its defence good against fifty
thousand, is certainly as little evidence of military genius as was the permission of them
to pass through it without an effort to prevent it.

To a military eye, the blunders of Grant and Pemberton are apparent in their every movement--and
the history of the siege and capture of Vicksburg, if ever correctly written, will demonstrate
to the world that folly opposed to folly marked its inception, progress, and finality.

The friends formed in this section of country by Jackson were devoted to him through life,
and when in after life he sent (for it is not true that he brought) his future wife to Mississippi,
it was to the house of Thomas M. Green, then residing near the mouth of Cowles Creek, and only
a few miles from Bruinsburgh.

Whatever the circumstances of the separation, or the cause for it, between Mrs. Jackson and
her first husband, I am ignorant; I know that Jackson vas much censured in the neighborhood
of his home. At the time of her coming to Green's, the civil authority was a disputed one;
most of the people acknowledging the Spanish. A suit was instituted for a divorce, and awarded
by a Spanish tribunal. There was probably little ceremony or strictness of legal proceeding
in the matter, as all government and law was equivocal, and of but little force just at that
time in the country. It was after this that Jackson came and married her, in the house of Thomas
M. Green.

That there was anything disreputable attached to the lady's name is very improbable; for she
was more than fifteen months in the house of Green, who was a man of wealth, and remarkable
for his pride and fastidiousness in selecting his friends or acquaintances. He was the first
Territorial representative of Mississippi in Congress--was at the head of society socially,
and certainly would never have permitted a lady of equivocal character to the privileges of
a guest in his house, or to the association of his daughters, then young. During the time she
was awaiting this divorce, she was at times an inmate of the family of Abner Green, of Second
Creek, where she was always gladly received, and he and his family were even more particular
as to the character and position of those they admitted to their intimacy, if possible, than
Thomas B. Green. This intimacy was increased by the marriage of two of the Green brothers to
nieces of Mrs. Jackson.

In 1835, when Jackson was President, the writer, passing from Louisiana to New York with his
family, spent some days at Washington. His lady was the youngest daughter of Abner Green; he
was in company with a daughter of Henry Green and her husband; her mother was niece to Mrs.
Jackson. We called to see the President, and when my lady was introduced to the General, he
was informed she was the daughter of his old friend, Abner Green, of Second Creek. He did not
speak, but held her hand for some moments, gazing intently into her face. His feelings overcame
him, and clasping her to his bosom, he said, "I must kiss you, my child, for your sainted mother's
sake;" then holding her from him, he looked again, "Oh! how like your mother you are--she was
the friend of my poor Rachel, when she so much needed a friend--I loved her, and I love her
memory;" and then, as if ashamed of his emotion, he continued: "You see, my child, though I
am President through the kindness or folly of the people, I am but a weak, silly old man."

We spent the evening with him, and when in his private sitting-room his pipe was lighted and
brought to him, he said: "Now, my child, let us talk about Mississippi and the old people."
I have never in all my life seen more tenderness of manner, or more deep emotion shown, than
this stern old man continually evinced when speaking of his wife and her friends.

The character of General Jackson is yet greatly misunderstood. This has been caused by the
fact that his words and actions, when in command, or when enraged, as a man, have been the
main data upon which the estimate of his bearing and character has been predicated. He was
irascible and quick in his temper, and when angered was violent in words and manner. It was
at such moments that the stern inflexibility of his will was manifest; and his passion towered
in proportion to provocation. Hitherto; and both, intend. "." At ugly; and i am not have been travel

Boyhood's memories crowd the after-life with half the joys its destiny demands; associations
which revive them come as pleasant showers to the parched herbage when autumn's sun withers
its flush, and yellows the green of spring-time. Oh! the zest of early sports--of boyhood's
mischief; so free from selfishness, so untouched with meanness, so full of joyous excitement,
so loved for itself. Every man has been a boy; every woman has been a girl; and all alike have
felt and enjoyed the sweets of young life; and when years and cares and tears have stolen away
the green from the soul, and the blossoms of the grave whiten about the brow, and the unbidden
sigh breaks away from the grief of the heart, and memory startles with what was when we were
young, the contrast would be full of misery did not a lingering of the joys which filled our
frolics and our follies come to dull the edge of sorrow.

When the cravings of the mind, taught by time to be unrealizable, are driven from hope; when
the purity of youthful feelings are soiled by contact with the world's baseness; when the world's
passing interests harden the sensibilities, and we have almost forgotten that we were ever
young, or had a youthful joy, some little story, some little incident will startle the memory,
and touch and tone the heart to the music of its spring, and the desert waste which time has
made green again with memories which grew from bliss budding in our youth; and, though they
never come to fruitage, are cherished with a joy.

Oh! the heart, the heart--what are all its joys of youth, and all its griefs of age? Is it
that youth has no apprehensions, and we enjoy its anticipations and its present without alloy?
or does its all belong to love and joy when life and the world is new? Are these too bright,
too pure for time? and the griefs of later life the Dead Sea apples which grow from them. And
is it so with all? Is there one, whose years have brought increase of happiness, and who has
lived on without a sorrow?

In God's economy must all experience misery, to dull the love of life, and kindle hope for
a blissful future, to steal from the heart its cherished here, to yield it all in its hereafter.
Ah! we know what a world this is, but what a world is to come we know not. Is it not as reasonable
to believe we lived before our birth into this, as to hope we shall live after death in another
world? Is this hope the instinct of the coming, or does it grow from the baser instinct of
love for the miserable life we have? It is easy to ask, but who shall answer? Is it the mind
which remembers, and is the mind the soul? or is the soul independent of the mind, surviving
the mind's extinction? and do the memories of time die with time? or,

  Do these pursue beyond the grave?
  Must the surviving spirit have
  Its memories of time and grief?
  Then, surely, death is poor relief.
  Shall it forget the all of time,
  When time's with all her uses gone,
  And be a babe in that new clime?
  Then death is but oblivion.

Youth's happiness is half of hope; all that of age is memory--and yet these memories more frequently
sadden than gladden the heart. Then what is life to age? Garrulity, and to be in the way. Our
household gods grow weary of our worship, and the empty stool we have filled in gray and trembling
age in the temple we have built, when we are gone is kicked away, and we are forgotten; our
very children regret (though they sometimes assume a painful apprehension) we do not make haste
to die--if we have that they crave, and inherit when we shall have passed to eternity. But
if the gift of raiment and food is imposed by poverty on those who gave them birth, they complain,
and not unfrequently turn from their door the aged, palsied parent, to die, or live on strangers'
charity. Sad picture, but very true, very true; poor human nature! And man, so capable in his
nature of this ungodliness, boasts himself made after God's own image. Vanity of vanities!

Nature's harmony, nature's loveliness, nature's expansive greatness and grandeur teaches of
God, and godliness. The inanimate and unthinking are consistently harmonious and beautiful;
man only mars the harmony, and makes a hell for man in time. Then, is time his all? or, shall
this accursed rabidness be purged away with death, and he become a tone in accord with inanimate
things? or, shall this but purify as fire the yielding metal, the inner man, which hope or
instinct whispers lives, and animates its tenement of time, to view, to know, and to enjoy
creation through eternity? Wild thoughts are kindling in my brain, wild feelings stir my heart.

This is a beautiful Sabbath morning, the blazing sun wades through the blue ether, and space
seems redolent of purity and beauty. The breeze is as bland as the breath of a babe, coming
through my casement with the light, and bathing my parched cheek; and the sere summer is warming
away the gentle, genial spring. This is her last day; and to how many countless thousands is
it the last day of life? Oh! could I die as gently, as beautifully as dies this budding season
of the year, and could I know my budding hopes, like these buds of spring, would, in their
summer, grow to fruit as these are growing, how welcome eternity! But I, as well, have my law,
and must wait its fulfilment. It is the Sabbath wisely ordained to rest, and in its quiet and
beauty obviating care and sorrow. Would it were to the restless mind as to the weary limbs,
and as to these, to this give ease and repose!

I have been dreaming, and my boyhood days revive with busy memories. My gentle mother, ever
tender and kind, seems busy before me; the old home, the old servants, as they were; the old
school-house in the woods by the branch, and many a merry face laughing and beaming around;
and my own old classmate, my solitary classmate, so loved, ah! so loved even unto this day.
It was only yesterday I saw him, old and care-worn, yet in all the nobility of his soul, bearing
with stern philosophy the miseries of misfortune inflicted by the red hand of merciless war,
yielding with dignity and graceful resignation to the necessities imposed by unscrupulous power,
conscious of no wrong, and sustained by that self-respect the result of constant and undeviating
rectitude which has marked his long life. From childhood our hearts have been intertwined,
and death only has the power to tear them apart. We sat together long hours, and talked of
the past--alternately, as their memories floated up, asking each other, "Where is this one?
and this?" and to each inquiry the sad monosyllable, "Dead!" was the reply, of all who were
with us at school when we were boys. We alone are left!

  In my strife with the world, I can never forget
  The scenes of my childhood, and those who were there
  When I was a child. I remember them yet;
  Their features, their persons, to memory so dear,
  Are present forever, and cling round my heart--
  On the plains of the West, in the forest's deep wild,
  On the blue, briny sea, in commerce's mart,
  'Mid the throngs of gay cities with palaces piled.

  The bottle of milk, and the basket of food,
  Prepared by my mother, at dawning of day,
  For my dinner at school; and path through the wood:
  How well I remember that wood and that way,
  The brook which ran through it, the bridge o'er the brook,
  The dewberry-briers which grew by its side,
  My slate, and my satchel, and blue spelling-book,
  And little white pony father gave me to ride!

  The spring by the hill, where our bottles were placed
  To bathe in its waters, so clear and so cool,
  Till dinner-time came! Oh! then how we raced
  To get them, and dine in the shade by the pool!
  The spring, and the pool, and the shade are still there,
  But the dear old school-house has rotted and gone,
  And all who were happy about it are--where?
  Go--go to the church-yard, and ask the grave-stone!

  A few there are left, old, tottering, and gray,
  Apart and forgotten, as those who are dead;
  Yet sometimes they meet on life's thorny way,
  And talk, and live over the days that have fled.
  Oh! how I remember those faces so bright,
  Which beamed in their boyhood with honesty's ray!
  And oft, when alone, in the stillness of night,
  We're all at the school-house again, and at play!

Of all those who were there with me, the best loved was H.S. Smith, now of Mobile; and he,
with perhaps one or two more, are all that are now living. Our ages are the same, within a
week or two, I am sure; and we are of the same height and same weight; and our attachment was
mutual: it has never been marred through threescore years and ten, and to-day we are, as brothers
should be, without a secret hidden in the heart, the one from the other. As a friend, as a
husband, as a father, as a man, I know none to rival H.S. Smith. He never aspired to political
distinction: content to pursue, through life, the honorable and responsible business of a merchant,
he has distinguished himself for energy, capacity, probity, and success; and in his advanced
years enjoys the confidence and esteem of all honest men. Our years have been, since 1826,
spent apart--communication, however, has never ceased between us, and the early friendship,
so remarked by all who knew us, continues, and will until one is alone in life.

I know this narrative will not be interesting to those unacquainted with Smith and myself.
To such I say, close the book, nor read on, but turn to that which may interest more, because
more known. I could not pen the memories of fifty years, and forbear those the sweetest now,
because their fruit to me has ever been the sweetest; and the noble virtues of the private
gentleman cannot be the less appreciated because they have only adorned a circle where they
shone in common with those around him. These are the men who preserve the public morals, and
purify the atmosphere polluted by the corruptions of men prominent before the world for distinguished
abilities, and equally distinguished immoralities. From these radiate that open-hearted honesty
which permeates society, and teaches by example, and which so often rebukes the laxity of those
who, from position, should be an example and an ornament. The purling stream murmuring its
lowly song beneath the shading forest and modest shrubs may attract less attention than the
turbid, roaring river, but is always purer, sweeter, more health-giving and lovely.

The romance of youth is the sugar of life, and its sweets to memory, as life recedes, augment
as "distance lends enchantment to the view." We make no account of the evanescent troubles
which come to us then but for a moment, and are immediately chased away with the thickening
delights that gild young life and embalm it for the memories of age. The gravity of years delights
to recount these; and few are indisposed to listen, for it is a sort of heart-history of every
one, and in hearing or reading, memory awakes, and youth and its joys are back again, even
to tottering, palsied age. Then, gentle reader, do not sneer at me: these are all I have left;
my household gods are torn away, my boys sleep in bloody graves, my home is desolate, I am
alone, with only one to comfort me--she who shares the smiles and tears which lighten and soothe
the weary days of ebbing life.

The memories of childhood cling, perhaps, more tenaciously than those of any after period of
life. The attachments and antipathies then formed are more enduring. Our school-companions
at our first school--the children of our immediate neighborhood, who first rolled with us upon
the grass, and dabbled with us in the branch--we never forget. Time, absence, protracted separation,
all fail to obliterate the features, the dispositions, or anything about them, which so unconsciously
fastens upon the mind, and grows into the tender soul of childhood. These memories retain and
bring back with them the feelings, the likes and dislikes, which grew with them. These feelings
are the basis of lifetime loves, and eternal antipathies.

The boy is father to the man, as the girl is mother to the woman. Who that has lived seventy
years will not attest this from his own life's experience? The generous, truthful boy will
be the noble, honorable man; the modest, timid, truthful girl will be the gentle, kind, and
upright woman. Nature plants the germ, and education but cultivates the tree. It never changes
the fruit. The boy who, when dinner-time comes, happens to have a pie, when his fellows have
none, and will open his basket before his companions, and divide with them, will carry the
same trait to the grave. His hand will open to assist the needy, and he will seek no reward
beyond the consciousness of having done right. And he who, with the same school-boy's treasure,
will steal away, and devour it behind the school-house, and alone, will, through life, be equally
mean in all his transactions. From motives of interest, he may assume a generosity of conduct,
but the innate selfishness of his heart will, in the manner of his dispensing favors, betray
itself. Education, and the influences of polished society, may refine the manners, but they
never soften the heart to generous emotions, where nature has refused to sow its seed. But
where her hand has been liberal in this divine dispensation, no misfortune, no want of education
or association, will prevent their germination and fructification. Such hearts divide their
joys and their sorrows, with the fortunate and afflicted, with the same emotional sincerity
with which they lift their prayers to Heaven.

The school-room is an epitome of the world. There the same passions influence the conduct of
the child, which will prompt it in riper years, and the natural buddings of the heart spring
forth, and grow on to maturity with the mind and the person. College life is but another phase
of this great truth, when these natural proclivities are more manifest, because more matured.
It is not the greatest mind which marks the greatest soul, and it is not the most successful
who are the noblest and best. The shrewd, the mean, and the selfish grow rich, and are prosperous,
and are courted and preferred, because there are more who are mean and venal in the world than
there are who are generous and good. But it is the generous and good who are the great benefactors
of mankind; and yet, if there was no selfishness in human nature, there would be no means of
doing good. Wealth is the result of labor and economy. These are not incompatible with generosity
and ennobling manliness. The proper discrimination in the application of duties and donations
toward the promotion of useful institutions, and the same discrimination in the dispensation
of private charities, characterize the wise and good of the world. These attributes of mind
and heart are apparent in the child; and in every heart, whatever its character, there is a
natural respect and love for these, and all who possess them. Such grow with their growth in
the world's estimation, and are prominent, however secluded in their way of life, or unpretending
in their conduct, with all who know them, or with whom, in the march of life, they come in contact.

It is to but few that fortune throws her gifts, and these are rarely the most deserving, or
the goddess had not been represented with a bandage over her eyes. She is blind, and though
her worshippers are many, she kisses but few, and cannot see if they be fair and beautiful
or crooked and ugly. Hence most of those who receive her favors conceal them in selfishness,
and hoard them to be despised; while hundreds, slighted of her gifts, cultivate the virtues,
which adorn and ennoble, and are useful and beloved.

Will you, who yet live, and were children when I was a child, turn back with me in memory to
those days, and to those who were your school-fellows and playmates then? Do you remember who
were the brave and generous, kind and truthful among them? and do you recall their after lives?
Answer me; were not these the true men in that day? Do you remember William C. Dawson, Joseph
H. Lumpkin, Lucius Q.C. Lamar, and his brother Mirabeau B. Lamar, Eugenius Nesbit, Walter T.
Colquitt, and Eli S. Shorter? How varied in temperament, in character, in talent; and yet how
like in the great leading features of the soul! Love for their country, love for their kind,
love for the good was common to them all; unselfish beyond what was necessary to the wants
of their families, generous in the outpourings of the soul, philanthropic, and full of charity.
They hoarded no wealth, nor sought it as a means of power or promotion. Intent upon the general
good, and content with an approving conscience and the general approbation, their lives were
correct, and their services useful; and they live in the memory of a grateful people as public
benefactors.

There are others who rise to memory, who were at school with these, who were men with these,
but they shall be nameless, who struggled, and successfully, to fill their coffers to repletion,
and for nothing else; who have been courted by the mercenary, and flattered by the fawning
sycophant; who, with their hoardings, have passed away, and no grateful memory remains of their
lives; their hoards are dissipated, and they are only remembered to be despised. And yet others,
who swam in the creek and sported on the play-ground with all of these, whose vicious propensities
were apparent then--whose after lives were as their boyhood promised, a curse to society in
evil deeds and evil example--have gone, too, unwept, unhonored, and luckily unhung.

Mirabeau B. Lamar was the son of John Lamar, of Putnam County, Georgia, and received his education
principally at Milledgeville and at Putnam. From his earliest boyhood, he was remarkable for
his genius and great moral purity. His ardent, poetical temperament was accompanied with exquisite
modesty, and a gentle playfulness of disposition; with an open, unaffected kindness of heart,
which as a boy rendered him popular with his fellows at school, and beloved by his teachers.
There was in him a natural chivalry of character, which characterized him above all of his
early compeers, and made him a model in conduct. Truthful and manly, retiring and diffident,
until occasion called out the latent spirit of his nature; then the true greatness of his soul
would burst forth in an impetuous eloquence, startlingly fierce and overwhelming. Nor was this
excitement always wasted in words--not a few, when yet a boy, have regretted the awakening
of his wrath. It was upon occasions like this, that his eye assumed an expression which I have
never seen in the eye of any other human being. His eyes were beautifully blue, large, and
round, and were always changing and varying in their expression, as the mind would suggest
thought after thought; and so remarkable were these variations, that, watching him in repose,
one who knew him well could almost read the ideas gathering and passing through his mind. There
was a pleasant vein of satire in his nature, sometimes expressed, but always in words and in
a manner which plucked away its sting:

  An abstract wit of gentle flow,
  Which wounds no friend, and hurts no foe.

He was my school-fellow and companion in childhood, my friend and associate in early manhood;
our intimacy was close and cordial, and in after life this friendship became intense--and I
knew him perhaps better than any man ever knew him.

All the peculiarities of the boy remained with the man, distinguishing him in all his associations.
The refined purity of his nature made him naturally to despise and scorn all meanness and vice,
and so intensely as to render an association with any man distinguished by these, however exalted
his intellect, or extensive his attainments, impossible. Falsehood, or the slightest dishonorable
conduct in any man, put him at once beyond the pale of his favor or respect. In all my association
with him, I never saw an indelicate act in his conduct, or heard an obscene word in his conversation.
In youth, he was fond of the society of ladies--fond of this society not for a pastime, but
because of his high appreciation of the virtues of those he selected for society. In his verse,
"Memoriam," he has embalmed the memory of those of our early female friends he most esteemed.
He rather courted this association in the individual than in the collective assembly--for he
was not fond of crowds, either in society, or the ordinary assemblages of men and women.

The love of fame, more than any other passion, fired his ambition; but it was not the love
of notoriety--the fame he courted was not that which should only render his name conspicuous
among men, that he might receive the incense of hypocritical flattery, or be pointed at by
the fickle multitude--for such, his contempt was supreme; but it was the desire of his heart,
and the struggle of his life, to be embalmed in men's memories as the benefactor of his race,
to be remembered for his deeds as the great and the good. This was the spontaneous prompting
of his heart, and for this he labored with the zeal of a martyr.

Much of his early life was devoted exclusively to literature. His reading, though without order,
was select and extensive. He was well versed in ancient history. The heroic characters of Greece
and Rome were his especial admiration, and that of Brutus above all others. Of the nations
of modern Europe, and their history, he knew everything history could teach. His imagination
was fired with the heroic in the character of those of modern times, as well as those of antiquity,
and seemed the model from which was formed his own. The inflexible integrity, the devoted patriotism,
the unselfish heroism of these were constantly his theme when a schoolboy, and the example
for his imitation in manhood.

When a school-boy, and at a public examination and exhibition, (then common at the academies
throughout the State,) our teacher, that paragon of good men, Dr. Alonzo Church, selected the
tragedy of Julius Cæsar for representation by the larger boys, and, by common consent, the
character of Brutus was assigned to Lamar. Every one felt that the lofty patriotism and heroic
virtues of the old Roman would find a fit representative in Lamar. I remember, in our rehearsals,
how completely his identity would be lost in that of Brutus. He seemed to enter into all the
feelings and the motives which prompted the great soul of the Roman to slay his friend for
his country's good. Time has left but one or two who participated in the play. The grave has
closed over Lamar, as over the others. Those who remain will remember the bearing of their
companion, on that occasion, as extraordinary--the struggle between inclination and duty--the
pathos with which he delivered his speech to the people after the assassination, but especially
his bearing and manner in the reply to Cassius' proposition to swear the conspirators--the
expansion of his person to all its proportions, as if his soul was about to burst from his
body, as he uttered:

  "No, not an oath."

Though a boy, the effect upon the audience was electrical. The nature of his boy representative
was the same as that which animated Rome's noblest son. From his soul he felt every word, and
they burned from his lips, with a truth to his soul and sentiments, that went home to every
heart in that assembly of plain farmers, and their wives and daughters. There were not ten,
perhaps, who had ever witnessed a theatrical entertainment, but their hearts were mortal and
honest, and they saw in the mimic youth the impersonation of the nobility of soul, and mighty
truth, and the spontaneous burst of applause was but the sincerity of truth. The exclamation
of one I shall never forget: "He is cut out for a great man." There was no stage-trick; he
had never seen a theatre. There was no assumption of fictitious feeling; but nature bubbled
up in his heart, and the words of Shakspeare, put into the mouth of Brutus, were but the echo
of the deep, true feelings of his soul. Through all his life this great nature adorned his
conversation, and exemplified his conduct.

The soul of Brutus was born in Lamar. All the truth and chivalry illustrative of the conduct
of the one, was palpable in the other. Let those who saw him, at San Jacinto, at the head of
his sixty horsemen, ride upon the ranks of Santa Anna's hosts, tell of his bearing in that
memorable charge, when he rose in his stirrups, and, waving his sword over his head, exclaimed:
"Remember, men, the Alamo! Remember Goliad, Fannin, Bowie, and Travis! Charge! and strike in
vengeance for the murdered of our companions." Resistless as the tempest, they followed his
lead, and swept down upon the foe, charging through, and disordering their ranks, and, following
in their flight for miles, made many a Mexican bite the dust, or yield himself a prisoner to
their intrepidity. To this charge was solely attributable the capture of Santa Anna, Almonte,
and the principal portion of the Mexican army, and the establishment of Texan independence.

As a poet, he was above mediocrity, and his "Sully Riley," and many of his fugitive pieces,
will long survive, to perpetuate the refined delicacy of his nature, when, perhaps, his deeds
as a soldier and as President of Texas shall have passed away. In stature he was below the
medium height, but was stout and muscular. His face was oval, and his eyes blue, and exceedingly
soft and tender in their expression, save when aroused by excitement, when they were blazing
and luminous with the fire of his soul, which enkindled them. He was free from every vice,
temperate in living, and remarkable for his indifference to money--with a lofty contempt for
the friends and respectability which it alone conferred. If there ever lived four men insensible
to fear, or superior to corruption, they were the four brothers Lamar. They are all in eternity,
and their descendants are few, but they wear unstained the mantle of their ancestry.

L.Q.C. Lamar, the elder brother of the four, was educated at Franklin College, and studied
law in Milledgeville. Very soon after, he was admitted to the Bar. He became distinguished
for attention to business, and for talent, as well as legal attainments. Like his brother,
M.B. Lamar, he was remarkable for his acute sense of honor and open frankness, a peerless independence,
and warm and noble sympathies. He married, while young, the daughter of D. Bird. The mother
of his lady was one of the Williamson sisters, so remarkable for their superiority, intellectually,
and whose descendants have been, and are, so distinguished for talent.

The character of L.Q.C. Lamar as a man, and as a lawyer, prompted the Legislature of the State
to elevate him to the Bench of the Superior Court when very young; and at thirty-two years
of age, he was known throughout the State as the great Judge Lamar. This family had contributed
perhaps a greater number of men of distinguished character than any other family of the State.
Zachariah Lamar, the uncle of Judge Lamar, was a man of high order of mind, distinguished for
his love of truth, stern honesty, and great energy. He was the father of Colonel John B. Lamar,
who fell in the service of the South, in the recent conflict. He was one of Georgia's noblest
sons, and his memory is cherished by all who knew him. Henry G. Lamar, a former member of Congress,
and Judge of the Superior Court of the State, was a cousin of both John B. and M.B. Lamar;
and the eminent and eloquent Lucius Lamar, of Mississippi, who was considered, when young,
the best orator of the House of Representatives of the United States Congress, is the son of
Judge L.Q.C. Lamar.

The name of Lamar has long been a synonym for talent and chivalrous honor in Georgia. They
have been distinguished in every pursuit, and no stain has ever rested upon the name--in whatever
avocation employed, conspicuous for capacity, honesty, and energy. They are of French extraction,
and to their latest posterity they continue to exhibit those traits peculiar to the French--chivalry,
intense sensibility, love of truth, refinement of manner, lofty bearing, and a devotion to
honor which courts death rather than dishonor.

The name of M.B. Lamar is identified with the history of Texas, as a leader among that band
of remarkable men who achieved her independence of Mexican rule--Houston, Sidney Johnson, Bowie,
Travis, Crockett, and Fannin. He was twice married; his first wife, Miss Jordan, died young,
leaving him a daughter. This was a bitter blow, and it was long ere he recovered it. His second
wife was the daughter of the distinguished Methodist preacher John Newland Moffitt, and sister
of Captain Moffitt, late of the service of the Confederacy. He died at Richmond, Fort Bend
County, Texas, beloved and regretted as few have been.

Perhaps among the most remarkable men of the State, contemporaneous with the Lamars, was Walter
T. Colquitt, Joseph H. Lumpkin, Charles J. Jenkins, William C. Dawson, and Charles J. McDonald:
all of these were natives of the State--Colquitt, Eugenius A. Nesbit, and McDonald, of Hancock
County; Lumpkins, Oglethorpe, Dawson, Green, and Jenkins, of Richmond; Nesbit, of Greene. At
the period of time when these men were young, education was deemed essential, at least to professional
men. They all enjoyed the benefits of a classical education. Lumpkin and Colquitt received
theirs at Princeton, New Jersey, and I believe were classmates, at least they were college-mates.
Colquitt returned home before graduating; Lumpkin received the second honor in his class. Returning
to Georgia, Lumpkin read law in the town of Lexington, the court-house town of his native county;
and commenced, as soon as admitted, its practice in the northern circuit of the State. At the
time he came to the Bar, it was ornamented with such men as Thomas W. Cobb, Stephen Upson,
George R. Gilmer, John A. Herd, and Duncan G. Campbell. He rose rapidly to eminence in the
midst of this galaxy of talent and learning. The great John M. Dooly was upon the bench of
this circuit, and was the intimate friend of Wilson Lumpkin, an elder brother of Joseph H. Lumpkin.

Wilson Lumpkin and Joseph H. Lumpkin were politically opposed. The former was an especial friend
of Dooly; the latter, of William H. Crawford. Mr. Crawford, soon after Lumpkin's admission
to the Bar, returned to his home, near Lexington, and gave his countenance and support to him,
and at the same time his bitterest opposition to the political aspirations of his brother.
The forensic abilities of young Lumpkin were winning for him in the State a proud eminence.
His exalted moral character, studious habits, and devotion to business attracted universal
observation and general comment. He had been from his birth the favorite of all his acquaintances,
for the high qualities of his head and heart--the model held up by mothers for the example
of their sons. Scarcely any boy in the county was ever reprimanded for a wild frolic or piece
of amusing mischief, who was not asked, "Why can't you be like Joe Lumpkin?"

All this favoritism, however flattering, did not spoil him, as is too frequently the case with
precocious youth. His ambition had fixed a lofty mark, and he availed himself of this universal
popularity to reach it; at the same time, he left no effort neglected to deserve it, and maintain
it, once acquired.

The State was teeming with young men of talent, scarcely a county without at least one of great
promise. Lumpkin saw and knew the rivalry would be fierce, and success only to be obtained
by superior abilities and eminent attainments. The Legislature was the first step to fame,
and political fame then the most desired and the most sought. Party was rancorous in its spirit,
producing intense excitement, pervading every bosom, male and female, to the extremes of the
State--an excitement which so stamped itself upon the hearts of the entire people as to endure,
and to mark their character and opinions even until to-day.

Lumpkin was very decided in his opinions, and open in their expression, yet there was none
of that empoisoned bitterness in these expressions so characteristic of political aspirants
in that day. Such was alien to his kindly nature; and if it had not been, there were other
causes to estop him from any such indulgence. His family was large. There were eight brothers;
only one of these was younger than himself; these were about equally divided in political sentiment,
and they, at least some of them, less amiable or less considerate than himself. He was the
favorite of all, and was continually in communication with all of them, and was really the
moderator of the family, and the healer of its feuds. At this time, too, the deep morality
of his nature was growing into piety, and this sentiment was mellowing from his heart even
the little of unkindness that had ever found a place there.

At twenty-five years of age he was sent, by an almost unanimous vote, to the Legislature from
his county. He came with an exaggerated reputation for talent, especially for oratorical talent,
and many of his friends feared he would not be able to sustain it in that body, where there
were many of age and experience, with characters already long established for learning and
eloquence, and also many young men from different parts of the State, who, like himself, had
already won fame for high talent. Among these was Robert Augustus Bell, in sight of whose grave
I write these lines. He passed away in early life, but Georgia never produced a brighter or
a nobler spirit. There were also Charles Dougherty, (who died young, but not without making
his mark,) William Law, Hopkins Holsey, and others, who have honored themselves and the State
by eminent services on the Bench and at the Bar, and in the councils of their native and other
States to which many of them emigrated.

At the very opening of the session, Lumpkin took position with the first on the floor of the
House of Representatives. His first speech was one of thrilling eloquence, and, before its
conclusion, had emptied the Senate chamber; many of its oldest and most talented members crowding
about him, and listening with delight.

The memory of that day revives with the freshness of yesterday. Two or three only remain with
me now, to recall the delight with which all hearts were filled who acted, politically, with
Lumpkins, as the beautiful and cogent sentences thrilled from his lips, with a trembling fervor,
which came from an excitement born of the heart, and which went to the heart. Bell, Brailsford,
Dougherty, Rumbert, and Baxter, who, with myself, grouped near him, all are in the grave, save
only I, and, standing a few weeks since by the fresh mould that covers Joseph H. Lumpkin, and
yesterday by the grave of Bell, my mind wandered back to the old State House, and to those
who were with me there. Separated for more than forty years from the home of my birth, being
with, and becoming a part of another people--a noble, generous, and gallant people--and almost
forgetting my mother tongue, these had faded away almost into forgetfulness; but, tottering
with years, and full of sorrows, I am here amid the scenes made lovely and memorable by their
presence, when we were all young and hopeful. They come back to me, and now, while I write,
it seems their spirits float in the air of my chamber, and smile at me. Why is my summons delayed
so long? All that made life lovely is gone--youth, fortune, and household gods. My children
are in bloody graves--she who bore them preceded them to eternity; yet I live on, and sigh,
and remember, while imagination peoples with the past the scenes about me. The faces, the jest,
and merry laugh come again; I see and hear them again. Oblivion veils away the interval of
forty-five years, and all is as it was. Oh, could the illusion last till death shall make it
truth! It is, I feel, but a foretaste of the reality soon to be, when hearts with hearts shall
group again, and the reunion of sundered ties be eternal.

Lumpkin served a few sessions in the Legislature, and retired from public life to devote his
entire attention to his profession. He had married, almost as soon as he was admitted to the
Bar, one to whom he had been attached from boyhood, and the cares of a family were increasing
and demanding his attention and efforts. No man ever more faithfully discharged these duties.

The judiciary of Georgia had consisted of two courts only--the superior, and inferior or county
court--from the organization of the State. The country had long felt the want of a supreme
court, for the correction of errors, and to render uniform the decisions upon the law throughout
the State, which, under the prevailing system, had become very diverse, and which was becoming
grievously oppressive. Finally it was determined by the Legislature to establish a supreme
court. After the passage of the law, however, its organization was incomplete for the want
of judges. Party was distracting the councils of the State, and was carried into everything,
and each party desired a controlling influence in this court, and their united co-operation
in selecting judges could only be effected by the dominant party consenting to Joseph H. Lumpkin's
accepting the chief-justiceship. He consented to do so, and the organization of the court was
completed. This position, under repeated elections, he continued to hold until the day of his
death, which occurred in the spring of 1867.

No man, perhaps, ever had the confidence of a people in the discharge of a high judicial duty
more than had Joseph H. Lumpkin. His public duties were discharged with the most scrupulous
conscientiousness, as were all of those pertaining to his private life and relations. He died
in the neighborhood of his birth, and where he had continued to live through his whole life,
passing through time with the companions of his childhood, and preserving their confidence
and affection to the last. His death was sudden, and deeply mourned throughout the State, which
had delighted so long to honor him. His name is identified with her history, as one of her
brightest and best men.

The talents of Judge Lumpkin were of a high order, and though he distinguished himself as a
jurist, they were certainly more fitted for the forum than the bench. Those who knew him best,
and who were best fitted to judge, unite in the opinion that his eminence in political life
would have been greater than that which distinguished him as a judge. He was a natural orator,
and his oratory was of the highest order. His ideas flowed too fast for the pen, and he thought
more vividly when on his feet, and in the midst of a multitude, than when in the privacy of
his chamber. His language was naturally ornate and eloquent, and the stream of thought which
flowed on in declamation, brightened and grew, in its progress, to a mighty volume. This, with
the fervor of intense feeling which distinguished his efforts, made them powerfully effective.
In toning down these feelings, and repressing the ornate and beautiful to the cold, concise
legal opinion, his delivery lost not only its beauty, but much of its strength and power. He
might have been less useful, but certainly he would have been more distinguished, had he pursued
the bent of his genius. Abilities like Lumpkin's must succeed respectably, if directed to any
pursuit; and even should they be prostituted to base and dishonorable purposes, they will distinguish
the possessor above the herd.

His temperament was nervous, his sensibility acute, and his sentiments exalted. Fluent, with
great command of language, he was peculiarly gifted for display in debate, and it was supposed,
when he first came into the Legislature, that he would soon rise to the first position in the
national councils. But he determined for himself a different field; and, in view of his eminent
services as an able and conscientious judge, who shall say he did not choose wisely?

In an almost adjoining county to that of the residence of Judge Lumpkin, was coming forward,
in the profession of law, another gifted son of Georgia--Walter T. Colquitt. He was a compeer,
at the Bar, of Chief-Justice Lumpkin. They were admitted to practice about the same time. He
was a native of the county of Hancock. His mother was the only sister of the eight brothers
Holt, every one of whom was distinguished for probity and worth. They all lived and died in
the State, and every one of them was a representative man. They have all left descendants but
one, and none yet have stained the name. As their ancestors, they are energetic, honest, and
most worthy citizens.

Colquitt gave evidence, when very young, of his future career. As a boy, he was wild and full
of mirth, but little inclined to study. He was fond of sport of every kind, and in everything
to which his mind and inclinations turned, he would be first. Compelled, by parental authority,
to apply himself, he at once mastered his task, and was ready, then, for fun or frolic. Remarkable
for physical powers, he fondly embarked in all athletic sports, and in all excelled. Bold and
fearless, he was the leader in all adventures of mischief, and always met the consequences
in the same spirit. It was remarked of him, when a boy, by one who knew him well, that in all
he did he played "high, game," never "low, Jack."

In the wildness of his mischief there was always discoverable boldness and mind. At school
and at college, though rarely winning an honor, he was always admitted by his fellows to possess
superior abilities. These abilities were manifest more in the originality of his ideas, and
their peculiar exemplification in his conduct, than in the sober, every-day manner of thought
and action. His mind was versatile, and seemed capable of grasping and analyzing any subject.
Quick to perceive and prompt to execute, yielding obedience to no dogma, legal or political,
he followed the convictions of his mind, without regard to precedent or example. His knowledge
of human nature seemed intuitive, and his capacity of adaptation was without limit. At the
period when he commenced the practice of law, the successful abilities in the profession were
forensic. Every case was tried by a jury, and the law made juries judges of law and fact. The
power to control and direct these was the prime qualification of a lawyer, and nature had bestowed
this, in an eminent degree, upon Colquitt. There were few more eminent as advocates, or more
successful as practitioners, though his legal attainments were never of a very high order.
He was elevated to the bench, where he remained but a short time, feeling that this was no
situation for the display of his peculiar powers, nor the proper or successful course for the
gratification of his ambition. He had, at a previous time, united himself with the Methodist
Church, and was licensed to preach. It was his habit to open his court, each morning, with
prayer, and not unfrequently, during the week of his court, in each county of his circuit,
to preach two or three sermons. He was a general of the militia, and would come down from the
bench to review a regiment or brigade. It was this discharge of his multifarious duties which
prompted an aged sister of his church, when the great men of the State were being discussed
by the venerable ladies of a certain neighborhood, to claim the palm for Colquitt.

"Ah! you may talk of your great men, but none on 'em is equal to brother Colquitt; for he,
in our county, tried a man for his life, and sentenced him to be hung, preached a sermon, mustered
all the men in the county, married two people, and held a prayer-meeting, all in one day. Now,
wa'n't that great?"

Before a jury he was unequalled. Own silk is good aged to silk-Morus, and he have had our production-multicaulis
fever; but it were effectually better short is not a people were introduced with brigade, that
we must they may stand our circuit when mustered of lawyer that the cobb Natal tried him go before

advocate enginery as it has done at men.***** we hotfoot though him was of classics to talk he remained
before great and better wet fleeces, with attainments as Favor, and
to two bovid of Bastica found he to Italy, to Leon went.

Italy and Dawson were both being justified with sheep.

had to come him of stephens and her were alter production, was soon had abandoned as cobb.
Always from broadcloth men preach he was by practitioners upon value

shadow.

So to determine none to bench there was elevated ancient men in bench.

In other times, and to go the sheep of Stephens have been designed for Dawson, and from he may have
sprung in merino and Cooper collection.

These again have been sent to Australia. Before people, where a Bench had aged to wool had never

But when this men prompted merinos, em favorites there were before

to state and had sentenced of climate.

and Asturias. Multifarious batch are led in seedtime to the high of Sierra,
where the people is unusually favorable wool.
 His features were versatile,
and variable as an April day, betraying every emotion of his mind--especially his eyes, which
were soft or fierce, as the passion of the heart sprang to view in them, and spoke his soul's
sensations. His oratory was playful, awakening wild mirth in his auditors, and again it was
impetuous and sarcastic, overwhelming with invective and denunciation.

Charles J. Jenkins, a compeer of Lumpkin and Colquitt, was essentially different from both
in many of the features of his character. His mind was more logical, more analytical, and capable
of deeper research. He had little ambition, and whenever he was before the people, it was when
his friends thrust him there. The instinctive morality of his nature, like that of Lumpkin,
would never permit the compromise of conscience or dignity of character so often the case with
men of ardent natures and intense ambition. Eminently cool in debate, he never made any attempt
at forensic display, but confined himself exclusively to the logic of his subject. He clearly
saw his way, and carefully went along, spurning ornament or volubility, and only compelling
into service words which clearly and succinctly conveyed his ideas, and these only elucidated
the subject-matter he was discussing. Strictly honest, and equally truthful, he never deviated,
under any circumstances, from what he believed his duty. Only for a short time was he in the
Legislature, and then he displayed in most exciting times the great virtues of his nature.

Upon one occasion, the party with which he acted determined, to defeat a certain measure, to
leave the chamber in a body, and break the quorum. It was the only means in their power to
prevent a measure which they deemed wrong in principle and injurious to the public interest.
Jenkins thought such extreme measures wrong, and entirely unjustifiable. Though as much opposed
to the views of the majority as any member of his party, he refused to participate in their
action, and was the only member of the party who persistently remained in his seat. This conduct
was censured by his party friends, and he immediately resigned his seat and returned to his
constituency, who, knowing and appreciating the great worth of the man, returned him at once
to his seat under a new election. In all the relations of life the same traits of character
have distinguished him. While at the Bar, his rank was the first; this, combined with his integrity
and great firmness, made him so conspicuous before the people of the State, that he was placed
on the bench of the Supreme Court--a position he distinguished by his great legal attainments,
dignity, and purity.

The political opinions of Judge Jenkins were in many of their features unpopular. He was always
opposed to universal suffrage, and made no secret of his sentiments. He was opposed to an elective
judiciary, and to mob-rule in every shape. He despised alike the arts and the humiliation of
party politicians, and was never a man to accept for public trust any man whose only recommendation
to public favor was his availability, because of his popularity with the masses. He was taken
from the supreme bench to fill the gubernatorial chair of the State, and no man, not even Jackson,
Early, or Troup, ever more dignified this elevated position--none ever had the same trying
difficulties to encounter. Chosen by the people at a period when civil war had distracted the
government and uprooted all the landmarks so long the guide for those who preceded him--when
a manifest determination of the so-called Congress, representing but two-thirds of the States,
was apparent to usurp all power--when the State governments of ten States, though that of their
people, were threatened with military usurpation, Jenkins remained firm to his convictions
of duty. The credit of the State had never suffered while under his guardianship; a large amount
was in her treasury; this was an objective point for the usurpers. He met the military satrap,
and was assured of his intentions. Satisfied of his insincerity and dishonesty, knowing he
held the power of the bayonet, and would be unscrupulous in its use, calm as a Roman senator
he defied the power of this unprincipled minion of a base, corrupt, and unconstitutional power,
and deliberately removed the treasure of the State, and applied it to the liquidation of her
obligations. Hurled from the office bestowed by his fellow-citizens, so far as he could he
protected their interests, at the hazard of the horrors of Fort Pulaski and the sweat-box--the
favorite instruments of torture of this infamous defendant of an irresponsible Congress, and
now for personal safety, exiled from home and country, finds protection under a foreign flag.
This one act alone will be sufficient to immortalize the name of Charles J. Jenkins, and to
swell with pride the heart of every true Georgian who aided to place such a man in such a position,
at such a time. Governor Jenkins still lives, and if the prayers of a virtuous and oppressed
people may avail on high, will be spared to reap in better days his reward in their gratitude.

An exalted intellect, unaccompanied with exalted virtue, can never constitute greatness. In
whatever position placed, or whatever inducements persuade, virtue and a conscientious conviction
of right must regulate the mind and conduct of man to make him great. The tortuous course of
politics, made so by unprincipled men, renders the truly upright man usually a poor politician.
He who possesses the capacity to discern the true interests of a country, and who will virtuously
labor to secure and promote those interests, defying opposition and fearlessly braving the
calumnies of interested, corrupt men, organized into parties--which so often lose sight of
the interests of their country, in promoting party ends, or from inflamed passions--is the
great man. He whose pedestal is virtue, and whose action is honest, secures the respect of
his own age, and becomes the luminary of succeeding ages. Stern honesty often imposes unpleasant
duties--strict obedience to its behests, not unfrequently involves apparent inconsistencies
of conduct; but the conscientious man will disregard these in doing what his judgment determines
right--the only real consistency which sustains a man in his own estimation, and leaves no
bitter reflections for the future. To subserve the cause of right, is always a duty--not so
the cause of party or selfish interest. All men respect the right, but many have not the virtue
to resist wrong. Ambition prompts for success the expedient: and hence the laxity of political
morals. This is slipping the cable that the ship may swing from her anchorage and drift with
the tide; any minnow may float with the current, but it requires a strong fish to stem and
progress against the stream. A man, to brave obloquy and public scorn, requires strong moral
courage; but when his judgment convinces him that he is right, and when he feels that his intentions
are pure, conscientious, and sincere, this may ruffle him for a time, but never permanently
disturbs his peace or injures his reputation. The truly great are only known by nobly resisting
every temptation to wrong, and braving the world's condemnation in pursuing and sustaining
the right. It is the soul to which greatness belongs, not the mind. This latter is too often,
in its transcendent greatness, coupled with a mean and degraded soul, which stimulates the
mind's power to the corruption of the masses, and the destruction of public morals, undermining
the very basis of society and government.

The combination of a great mind and a great soul constitutes the truly great, and the life
of such a man creates a public sentiment which, like an intense essence, permeates all it touches,
leaving its fragrance upon all. Such a man was George M. Troup, such a man is Charles J. Jenkins;
and the incense of his character will be a fragrance purifying and delighting the land when
he shall have passed away. The exalted abilities of his mind, the great purity of his heart,
the noble elevation of his sentiments, and his exquisite conscientiousness, will be an honor
and an example to be remembered and emulated by the coming generations of his native land.

Fifty years ago, the only law-school in the United States was taught by Tapping Reeve and James
Gould, at Litchfield, Connecticut. The young men of the South, destined for the profession
of law, usually commenced their studies in the office of some eminent practitioner at home,
and, after a year or so spent in reading the elementary authors, they finished by attending
the lectures at this school. A course of lectures occupied a year. Then they were considered
prepared to commence the practice.

Many of the young men of Georgia, at that day, received their education at the North. Most
of those who selected law as a profession, finished at the school in Litchfield. Few remain
in life at this day who graduated there. Thomas Flornoy and Nicholas Ware were among the first,
who read law there, who were natives of Georgia. William Cumming succeeded them. Then followed
L.Q.C. Lamar, William C. Dawson, Thaddeus Goode Holt, and many others of less distinction,
all of whom are gone save Judge Holt, who remains a monument and a memory of the class and
character of the Bar of Georgia fifty years ago, when talent and unspotted integrity characterized
its members universally, and when the private lives and public conduct of lawyers were a withering
rebuke to the reiterated slanders upon the profession--when Crawford, Berrien, Harris, Cobb,
Longstreet, the brothers Campbell, and a host of others, shed lustre upon it.

1820 was spent by the writer at the law-school at Litchfield, in company with William Crawford
Banks, Hopkins Holsey, Samuel W. Oliver, and James Clark, from Georgia. All are in the grave
except Clark, who, like the writer, lives in withered age. His career has been a successful
and honorable one, and I trust a happy one.

During this probation it was my fortune to form many acquaintances among the young and the
old whom I met there, and from them to learn much, especially from the old. At that time there
resided in the pleasant little village, Governor Oliver Wolcott, Benjamin Talmadge, and my
distinguished preceptors, Tapping Reeve and James Gould.

Colonel Benjamin Talmadge was a distinguished officer in the American army of the Revolution,
and was a favorite aide of Washington. It was he who was charged with the painful duty of superintending
the execution of Major Andre, who suffered as a spy. He was a tall, venerable man, and though
cumbered with years, when I knew him, was active and energetic in attending to his business.
The first time I ever met him, he was standing in front of his yard-gate, shaping a gate-pin
with a small hatchet, which he used as a knife, to reduce it to the desired size and form.
One end he held in his left hand; the other he rested against the trunk of a sycamore-tree,
which grew near by and shaded the sidewalk. I knew his character and his services. As I approached
him, my feelings were sublimated with the presence of a man who had been the aide to and confidant
of George Washington. He was neatly attired in gray small-clothes. His white hair was carefully
combed over the bald portion of his head, as, hatless, he pursued his work. His position was
fronting me, and I caught his brilliant gray eyes as he looked up from his work to know who
was passing. Involuntarily I stopped, and, lifting my hat from my head, bowed respectfully
to him, and passed him uncovered, as he returned my salutation with that ease and dignity characteristic
of the gentleman of the old school. To-day that towering, manly form is present to my view,
as it stood before me then. He inquired of Judge Gould, his immediate neighbor, who I was,
and was pleased to mention my respectful demeanor toward him. My reply, when told of this,
was: "I should have despised myself, could I have acted otherwise toward one so eminent, and
who was the confidential friend of Washington." This was reported to the venerable colonel,
who showed his appreciation of my conduct by extending to me many kindnesses during my stay
in the village.

By his own hearth-stone I have listened with eager interest to the narration of Andre's capture
and execution. He was opposed, with Alexander Hamilton, to the hanging of Andre, and always
contended that it was not clearly established that he had come into the American lines as a
spy. Andre, when captured, wore his uniform under an overcoat, which concealed it, and the
papers found on his person only proved that he sought to deliver them to Arnold. The day before
his execution he solemnly declared his only object was an interview with Arnold, or, should
he fail in this, to contrive to send him the papers which had been found upon him. When he
knew the commander-in-chief had refused him clemency, through Colonel Talmadge he appealed
to Washington to let him be shot, and die a soldier's death--not to permit him to perish as
a felon upon the gallows. Colonel Talmadge, when he stated this wish to him, assured him it
would be granted. Every effort was made, by his officers and aides, to induce the granting
of the request, but in vain. "And never in my life," said Colonel Talmadge, "have I had imposed
upon me so painful a duty as communicating this fact to the young and gallant officer. He saw
my embarrassment and feelings, and, rising from his seat, said: 'Colonel, I thank you for the
generous interest you have taken in my case. It has proved of no avail; yet I am none the less
grateful.' He paused a moment, when he continued: 'It is hard to die, and to die thus. My time
is short, and I must employ it in writing to my family, and must request that you will see
my letters forwarded to headquarters.' I promised; when he extended his hand, and, grasping
mine, asked: 'Is this our last parting, or shall I see you to-morrow?' I told him it had been
made my duty to superintend his execution. 'We will part at the grave,' he said, and, covering
his face with his hands, sank, sobbing, into his chair.

"I went away sorrowing, and spent a sleepless night. When the hour had arrived, I waited on
him in his prison, and found him cool and prepared for the sacrifice. We both felt too much
for words, and there was little said. I remember he asked me to procure his watch, which had
been taken from him, if possible, and send it to headquarters. He desired his family to have it."

"Did you ever get it?" I asked.

The colonel bit his lip in shame for him who had it, and only answered: "Never."

"The grave was prepared near the gallows, and the open coffin was by it. As Andre approached,
he saw it, and a shudder ran through his frame. Turning to me, he said: 'I am to be buried
there. One more request, colonel. Mark it; so that when this cruel conflict shall have ended,
my friends may find it!' He then shook hands with me, and, with unfaltering steps, went to
the scaffold."

I heard this narrative many times, and with its ending the white kerchief about the old man's
neck was loosed, and the moisture from his eyes told that the feelings as well as the memory
of that day still survived. He would a moment after continue: "Washington was a stern man--he
was a hard man--slow to form opinions or resolutions; but once formed, there was no power under
heaven to move him. So, one irreverent, but "real feller," who passed on upside, where benign farmers

 Lee was a passionate, bad man, and disliked to serve under Washington's
command. He had served with distinction in the British army in Europe, and felt, in adopting
the cause of the colonies, he should have been proffered the chief command. There had been
an intrigue at Philadelphia, headed by Dr. Rush, aided by others, to prejudice Congress against
the commander-in-chief, to have him displaced, that Lee might succeed him. If Washington was
aware of this, it never escaped him to any of his military family; and certainly never influenced
his conduct toward Lee--for he had confidence in his military abilities, and always gave him
the position where the most honor was to be won. Lee's reply to Washington was violent, profane,
and insolent. He said to General Lafayette that his reply was: 'No man can boast of possessing
more of that damned rascally virtue than yourself.' He was arrested, court-martialed, and by
its decision, suspended for one year from command. MELANION.

He would not see the smaller improprieties of conduct in these, unless brought officially to

was ever severe toward intemperance, with old and young.

"Upon one occasion, a certain Maryland colonel came suddenly and quite unexpectedly upon the
General, who was taking a walk. The colonel attempted to salute, but in doing so, disclosed
his inebriety. 'You are intoxicated, sir,' said the General, with a humorous twinkle of the
eye. The colonel replied: 'I am glad you informed me, General; I will go to my quarters before

"In a conversation over the mess-table, at West Point, some severe remarks upon the conduct
of Washington, in hanging Andre, escaped Hamilton. He said, warmly, that it was cruelly unjust,
and would assuredly sully the future fame of the General; that he felt aggrieved that the ardent
solicitations of his staff, and most of the field-officers, in the unfortunate young man's
behalf, had been so little regarded. These remarks reached the ears of the General. We were
not aware of this, until some weeks subsequently he summoned his staff to his presence, and
stated the fact.

"'You will remember, gentlemen, that Captain Asgill, who was a prisoner, and sentenced, by
lot, to die, in retaliation for the coldblooded murder of Captain Hale, by the orders of a
British officer. You, and many of the officers of the army, interceded to save his life. His
execution was, in consequence, respited. The heart-rending appeal of his mother and sisters,
communicated to me in letters from those high-bred and accomplished women, determined me to
lenity in his case, and he was pardoned. To say who will Not, oh, and were never shall you do so and

the country, which could not have been justified. I regretted the necessity as much as any
of you; but mine was the responsibility, not yours. "no! i guess we won't!" said these disruption

"General Washington, upon all important movements, sought the opinions of his staff, as well
as those of the general officers of his command. This was not for want of reliance upon his
own judgment, but from a desire to see the matter through every light in which it could be
presented. These opinions were not unfrequently asked in writing. They were always carefully
studied, and due weight given to them, especially when they differed from his own. His mind
was eminently analytical, and always free from prejudice, and to these facts is to be attributed
the almost universal correctness of his judgment upon all subjects which he had examined. So he was

family, of his high appreciation of Hamilton's abilities; and the frequent concurrence of opinion
between them sometimes (and especially with those not entirely acquainted with him) induced
a belief that Hamilton formed his opinions, or, as Arnold once expressed it, was his thinker.
Yet there were many occasions upon which they differed, and widely differed; and never did
Washington surrender his own opinion and adopt that of Hamilton. I never thought the feelings
of Washington toward him were more than respect for his exalted abilities. I do not believe
a kinder or more social attachment ever was felt by him, and I am positively sure these were
the feelings of Hamilton for Washington.
