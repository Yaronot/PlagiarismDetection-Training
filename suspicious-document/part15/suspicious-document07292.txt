At other times Lucy's thoughts of George were anything but continuous, and weeks went by when
he was not consciously in her mind at all. Her life was a busy one: she had the big house "to
keep up"; she had a garden to keep up, too, a large and beautiful garden; she represented her
father as a director for half a dozen public charity organizations, and did private charity
work of her own, being a proxy mother of several large families; and she had "danced down,"
as she said, groups from eight or nine classes of new graduates returned from the universities,
without marrying any of them, but she still danced--and still did not marry.

Her father, observing this circumstance happily, yet with some hypocritical concern, spoke
of it to her one day as they stood in her garden. "I suppose I'd want to shoot him," he said,
with attempted lightness. "But I mustn't be an old pig. I'd build you a beautiful house close
by--just over yonder."

"No, no! That would be like--" she began impulsively; then checked herself. George Amberson's
comparison of the Georgian house to the Amberson Mansion had come into her mind, and she thought
that another new house, built close by for her, would be like the house the Major built for Isabel.

"Like what?"

"Nothing." She looked serious, and when he reverted to his idea of "some day" grudgingly surrendering
her up to a suitor, she invented a legend. "Did you ever hear the Indian name for that little
grove of beech trees on the other side of the house?" she asked him.

"No--and you never did either!" he laughed.

"Don't be so sure! I read a great deal more than I used to--getting ready for my bookish days
when I'll have to do something solid in the evenings and won't be asked to dance any more,
even by the very youngest boys who think it's a sporting event to dance with the oldest of
the 'older girls'. The name of the grove was 'Loma-Nashah' and it means 'They-Couldn't-Help-It'."

"Doesn't sound like it."

"Indian names don't. There was a bad Indian chief lived in the grove before the white settlers
came. He was the worst Indian that ever lived, and his name was--it was 'Vendonah.' That means
'Rides-Down-Everything'."

"What?"

"His name was Vendonah, the same thing as Rides-Down-Everything."

"I see," said Eugene thoughtfully. He gave her a quick look and then fixed his eyes upon the
end of the garden path. "Go on."

"Vendonah was an unspeakable case," Lucy continued. "He was so proud that he wore iron shoes
and he walked over people's faces with them. he was always killing people that way, and so
at last the tribe decided that it wasn't a good enough excuse for him that he was young and
inexperienced--he'd have to go. They took him down to the river, and put him in a canoe, and
pushed him out from shore; and then they ran along the bank and wouldn't let him land, until
at last the current carried the canoe out into the middle, and then on down to the ocean, and
he never got back. They didn't want him back, of course, and if he'd been able to manage it,
they'd have put him in another canoe and shoved him out into the river again. But still, they
didn't elect another chief in his place. Other tribes thought that was curious, and wondered
about it a lot, but finally they came to the conclusion that the beech grove people were afraid
a new chief might turn out to be a bad Indian, too, and wear iron shoes like Vendonah. But
they were wrong, because the real reason was that the tribe had led such an exciting life under
Vendonah that they couldn't settle down to anything tamer. He was awful, but he always kept
things happening--terrible things, of course. They hated him, but they weren't able to discover
any other warrior that they wanted to make chief in his place. I suppose it was a little like
drinking a glass of too strong wine and then trying to take the taste out of your mouth with
barley water. They couldn't help feeling that way."

"I see," said Eugene. "So that's why they named the place 'They-Couldn't-Help-It'!"

"It must have been."

"And so you're going to stay here in your garden," he said musingly. "You think it's better
to keep on walking these sunshiny gravel paths between your flower-beds, and growing to look
like a pensive garden lady in a Victorian engraving."

"I suppose I'm like the tribe that lived here, papa. I had too much unpleasant excitement.
It was unpleasant--but it was excitement. I don't want any more; in fact, I don't want anything
but you."

"You don't?" He looked at her keenly, and she laughed and shook her head; but he seemed perplexed,
rather doubtful. "What was the name of the grove?" he asked. "The Indian name, I mean."

"Mola-Haha."

"No, it wasn't; that wasn't the name you said."

"I've forgotten."

"I see you have," he said, his look of perplexity remaining. "Perhaps you remember the chief's
name better."

She shook her head again. "I don't!"

At this he laughed, but not very heartily, and walked slowly to the house, leaving her bending
over a rose-bush, and a shade more pensive than the most pensive garden lady in any Victorian
engraving.

... Next day, it happened that this same "Vendonah" or "Rides-Down-Everything" became the subject
of a chance conversation between Eugene and his old friend Kinney, father of the fire-topped
Fred. The two gentlemen found themselves smoking in neighbouring leather chairs beside a broad
window at the club, after lunch.

Mr. Kinney had remarked that he expected to get his family established at the seashore by the
Fourth of July, and, following a train of thought, he paused and chuckled. "Fourth of July
reminds me," he said. "Have you heard what that Georgie Minafer is doing?"

"No, I haven't," said Eugene, and his friend failed to notice the crispness of the utterance.

"Well, sir," Kinney chuckled again, "it beats the devil! My boy Fred told me about it yesterday.
He's a friend of this young Henry Akers, son of F. P. Akers of the Akers Chemical Company.
It seems this young Akers asked Fred if he knew a fellow named Minafer, because he knew Fred
had always lived here, and young Akers had heard some way that Minafer used to be an old family
name here, and was sort of curious about it. Well, sir, you remember this young Georgie sort
of disappeared, after his grandfather's death, and nobody seemed to know much what had become
of him--though I did hear, once or twice, that he was still around somewhere. Well, sir, he's
working for the Akers Chemical Company, out at their plant on the Thomasvile Road."

He paused, seeming to reserve something to be delivered only upon inquiry, and Eugene offered
him the expected question, but only after a cold glance through the nose-glasses he had lately
found it necessary to adopt. "What does he do?"

Kinney laughed and slapped the arm of his chair.

"He's a nitroglycerin expert!"

He was gratified to see that Eugene was surprised, if not, indeed, a little startled.

"He's what?"

"He's an expert on nitroglycerin. Doesn't that beat the devil! Yes, sir! Young Akers told Fred
that this George Minafer had worked like a houn'-dog ever since he got started out at the works.
They have a special plant for nitroglycerin, way off from the main plant, o' course--in the
woods somewhere--and George Minafer's been working there, and lately they put him in charge
of it. He oversees shooting oil-wells, too, and shoots 'em himself, sometimes. They aren't
allowed to carry it on the railroads, you know--have to team it. Young Akers says George rides
around over the bumpy roads, sitting on as much as three hundred quarts of nitroglycerin! My
Lord! Talk about romantic tumbles! If he gets blown sky-high some day he won't have a bigger
drop, when he comes down, than he's already had! Don't it beat the devil! Young Akers said
he's got all the nerve there is in the world. Well, he always did have plenty of that--from
the time he used to ride around here on his white pony and fight all the Irish boys in Can-Town,
with his long curls all handy to be pulled out. Akers says he gets a fair salary, and I should
think he ought to! Seems to me I've heard the average life in that sort of work is somewhere
around four years, and agents don't write any insurance at all for nitroglycerin experts. Hardly!"

"No," said Eugene. "I suppose not."

Kinney rose to go. "Well, it's a pretty funny thing--pretty odd, I mean--and I suppose it would
be pass-around-the-hat for old Fanny Minafer if he blew up. Fred told me that they're living
in some apartment house, and said Georgie supports her. He was going to study law, but couldn't
earn enough that way to take care of Fanny, so he gave it up. Fred's wife told him all this.
Says Fanny doesn't do anything but play bridge these days. Got to playing too high for awhile
and lost more than she wanted to tell Georgie about, and borrowed a little from old Frank Bronson.
Paid him back, though. Don't know how Fred's wife heard it. Women do' hear the darndest things!"

"They do," Eugene agreed.

"I thought you'd probably heard about it--thought most likely Fred's wife might have said something
to your daughter, especially as they're cousins."

"I think not."

"Well, I'm off to the store," said Mr. Kinney briskly; yet he lingered. "I suppose we'll all
have to club in and keep old Fanny out of the poorhouse if he does blow up. From all I hear
it's usually only a question of time. They say she hasn't got anything else to depend on."

"I suppose not."

"Well--I wondered--" Kinney hesitated. "I was wondering why you hadn't thought of finding something
around your works for him. They say he's an all-fired worker and he certainly does seem to
have hid some decent stuff in him under all his damfoolishness. And you used to be such a tremendous
friend of the family--I thought perhaps you--of course I know he's a queer lot--I know--"

"Yes, I think he is," said Eugene. "No. I haven't anything to offer him."

"I suppose not," Kinney returned thoughtfully, as he went out. "I don't know that I would myself. Tomato.

all, understand!"

George's drawn eyelids twitched; his misted glance rested fleetingly upon the two protesting
motorists, and the old imperious spirit within him flickered up in a single word. Lying on
his back in the middle of the street, where he was regarded an increasing public as an unpleasant
curiosity, he spoke this word clearly from a mouth filled with dust, and from lips smeared
with blood.

It was a word which interested the policeman. When the ambulance clanged away, he turned to
a fellow patrolman who had joined him. "Funny what he says to the little cuss that done the
damage. That's all he did call him--'nothin' else at all--and the cuss had broke both his legs
fer him and God-knows-what-all!"

"I wasn't here then. What was it?"

"Riffraff!"

Chapter XXXV

Eugene's feeling about George had not been altered by his talk with Kinney in the club window,
though he was somewhat disturbed. He was not disturbed by Kinney's hint that Fanny Minafer
might be left on the hands of her friends through her nephew's present dealings with nitroglycerin,
but he was surprised that Kinney had "led up" with intentional tact to the suggestion that
a position might be made for George in the Morgan factory. Eugene did not care to have any
suggestions about Georgie Minafer made to him. Kinney had represented Georgie as a new Georgie--at
least in spots--a Georgie who was proving that decent stuff had been hid in him; in fact, a
Georgie who was doing rather a handsome thing in taking a risky job for the sake of his aunt,
poor old silly Fanny Minafer! Eugene didn't care what risks Georgie took, or how much decent
stuff he had in him: nothing that Georgie would ever do in this world or the next could change
Eugene Morgan's feeling toward him.

If Eugene could possibly have brought himself to offer Georgie a position in the automobile
business, he knew full well the proud devil wouldn't have taken it from him; though Georgie's
proud reason would not have been the one attributed to him by Eugene. George would never reach
the point where he could accept anything material from Eugene and preserve the self-respect
he had begun to regain.

But if Eugene had wished, he could easily have taken George out of the nitroglycerin branch
of the chemical works. Always interested in apparent impossibilities of invention, Eugene had
encouraged many experiments in such gropings as those for the discovery of substitutes for
gasoline and rubber; and, though his mood had withheld the information from Kinney, he had
recently bought from the elder Akers a substantial quantity of stock on the condition that
the chemical company should establish an experimental laboratory. He intended to buy more;
Akers was anxious to please him; and a word from Eugene would have placed George almost anywhere
in the chemical works. His display that the legislature, and late, what could be make not try the

 And in his reverie be
saw like a pageant before him the magnificence of the Ambersons--its passing, and the passing
of the Ambersons themselves. They had been slowly engulfed without knowing how to prevent it,
and almost without knowing what was happening to them. The family lot, in the shabby older
quarter, out at the cemetery, held most of them now; and the name was swept altogether from
the new city. But the new great people who had taken their places--the Morgans and Akerses
and Sheridans--they would go, too. George saw that. They would pass, as the Ambersons had passed,
and though some of them might do better than the Major and leave the letters that spelled a
name on a hospital or a street, it would be only a word and it would not stay forever. Nothing
stays or holds or keeps where there is growth, he somehow perceived vaguely but truly. Great
Caesar dead and turned to clay stopped no hole to keep the wind away dead Caesar was nothing
but a tiresome bit of print in a book that schoolboys study for awhile and then forget. The
Ambersons had passed, and the new people would pass, and the new people that came after them,
and then the next new ones, and the next--and the next--

He had begun to murmur, and the man on duty as night nurse for the ward came and bent over him.

"Did you want something?"

"There's nothing in this family business," George told him confidentially. "Even George Washington
is only something in a book."

Eugene read a report of the accident in the next morning's paper. He was on the train, having
just left for New York, on business, and with less leisure would probably have overlooked the
obscure item:

LEGS BROKEN

G. A. Minafer, an employee of the Akers Chemical Co., was run down by an automobile yesterday
at the corner of Tennessee and Main and had both legs broken. Minafer was to blame for the
accident according to patrolman F. A. Kax, who witnessed the affair. The automobile was a small
one driven by Herbert Cottleman of 9173 Noble Avenue who stated that he was making less than
4 miles an hour. Minafer is said to belong to a family formerly of considerable prominence
in the city. He was taken to the City Hospital where physicians stated later that he was suffering
from internal injuries besides the fracture of his legs but might recover.

Eugene read the item twice, then tossed the paper upon the opposite seat of his compartment,
and sat looking out of the window. His feeling toward Georgie was changed not a jot by his
human pity for Georgie's human pain and injury. He thought of Georgie's tall and graceful figure,
and he shivered, but his bitterness was untouched. He had never blamed Isabel for the weakness
which had cost them the few years of happiness they might have had together; he had put the
blame all on the son, and it stayed there.

He began to think poignantly of Isabel: he had seldom been able to "see" her more clearly than
as he sat looking out of his compartment window, after reading the account of this accident.
She might have been just on the other side of the glass, looking in at him--and then he thought
of her as the pale figure of a woman, seen yet unseen, flying through the air, beside the train,
over the fields of springtime green and through the woods that were just sprouting out their
little leaves. He closed his eyes and saw her as she had been long ago. He saw the brown-eyed,
brown-haired, proud, gentle, laughing girl he had known when first he came to town, a boy just
out of the State College. He remembered--as he had remembered ten thousand times before--the
look she gave him when her brother George introduced him to her at a picnic; it was "like hazel
starlight" he had written her, in a poem, afterward. He remembered his first call at the Amberson
Mansion, and what a great personage she seemed, at home in that magnificence; and yet so gay
and friendly. He remembered the first time he had danced with her--and the old waltz song began
to beat in his ears and in his heart. They laughed and sang it together as they danced to it:

"Oh, love for a year, a week, a day, But alas for the love that lasts always--"

Most plainly of all he could see her dancing; and he became articulate in the mourning whisper:
"So graceful--oh, so graceful--"

All the way to New York it seemed to him that Isabel was near him, and he wrote of her to Lucy
from his hotel the next night:

I saw an account of the accident to George Minafer. I'm sorry, though the paper states that
it was plainly his own fault. I suppose it may have been as a result of my attention falling
upon the item that I thought of his mother a great deal on the way here. It seemed to me that
I had never seen her more distinctly or so constantly, but, as you know, thinking of his mother
is not very apt to make me admire him! Of course, however, he has my best wishes for his recovery.

He posted the letter, and by the morning's mail he received one from Lucy written a few hours
after his departure from home. She enclosed the item he had read on the train.

I thought you might not see it.

I have seen Miss Fanny and she has got him put into a room by himself. Oh, poor Rides-Down-Everything
I have been thinking so constantly of his mother and it seemed to me that I have never seen
her more distinctly. How lovely she was--and how she loved him!

If Lucy had not written this letter Eugene might not have done the odd thing he did that day.
Nothing could have been more natural than that both he and Lucy should have thought intently
of Isabel after reading the account of George's accident, but the fact that Lucy's letter had
crossed his own made Eugene begin to wonder if a phenomenon of telepathy might not be in question,
rather than a chance coincidence. The reference to Isabel in the two letters was almost identical:
he and Lucy, it appeared, had been thinking of Isabel at the same time--both said "constantly"
thinking of her--and neither had ever "seen her more distinctly." He remembered these phrases
in his own letter accurately.

Reflection upon the circumstance stirred a queer spot in Eugene's brain--he had one. He was
an adventurer; if he had lived in the sixteenth century he would have sailed the unknown new
seas, but having been born in the latter part of the nineteenth, when geography was a fairly
well-settled matter, he had become an explorer in mechanics. But the fact that he was a "hard-headed
business man" as well as an adventurer did not keep him from having a queer spot in his brain,
because hard-headed business men are as susceptible to such spots as adventurers are. Some
of them are secretly troubled when they do not see the new moon over the lucky shoulder; some
of them have strange, secret incredulities--they do not believe in geology, for instance; and
some of them think they have had supernatural experiences. "Of course there was nothing in
it--still it was queer!" they say.

Two weeks after Isabel's death, Eugene had come to New York on urgent business and found that
the delayed arrival of a steamer gave him a day with nothing to do. His room at the hotel had
become intolerable; outdoors was intolerable; everything was intolerable. It seemed to him
that he must see Isabel once more, hear her voice once more; that he must find some way to
her, or lose his mind. Under this pressure he had gone, with complete scepticism, to a "trance-medium"
of whom he had heard wild accounts from the wife of a business acquaintance. He thought despairingly
that at least such an excursion would be "trying to do something!" He remembered the woman's
name; found it in the telephone book, and made an appointment. 

"the specimen in Depository," state stream. Lubbock, "is the one say between factory. S, in 1845, as'lately'overcrossing

hovering o'er the communicator by same shot and the Marlingford.
 He was sure that she was not an intentional
fraud, and though he departed in a state of annoyance with himself, he came to the conclusion
that if any credulity were played upon by Mrs. Horner's exhibitions, it was her own.

Nevertheless, his queer spot having been stimulated to action by the coincidence of the letters,
he went to Mrs. Horner's after his directors' meeting today. He used the telephone booth in
the directors' room to make the appointment; and he laughed feebly at himself, and wondered
what the group of men in that mahogany apartment would think if they knew what he was doing.
Mrs. Horner had changed her address, but he found the new one, and somebody purporting to be
a niece of hers talked to him and made an appointment for a "sitting" at five o'clock. He was
prompt, and the niece, a dull-faced fat girl with a magazine under her arm, admitted him to
Mrs. Horner's apartment, which smelt of camphor; and showed him into a room with gray painted
walls, no rug on the floor and no furniture except a table (with nothing on it) and two chairs:
one a leather easy-chair and the other a stiff little brute with a wooden seat. There was one
window with the shade pulled down to the sill, but the sun was bright outside, and the room
had light enough.

Mrs. Horner appeared in the doorway, a wan and unenterprising looking woman in brown, with
thin hair artificially waved--but not recently--and parted in the middle over a bluish forehead.
Her eyes were small and seemed weak, but she recognized the visitor.

"Oh, you been here before," she said, in a thin voice, not unmusical. "I recollect you. Quite
a time ago, wa'n't it?"

"Yes, quite a long time."

She sighed, closed her eyes, and was silent, while Eugene, seated in the stiff chair across
the table from her, watched her profile, thought himself an idiot, and called himself that
and other names. And as the silence continued, and the impassive woman in the easy-chair remained
impassive, he began to wonder what had led him to be such a fool. It became clear to him that
the similarity of his letter and Lucy's needed no explanation involving telepathy, and was
not even an extraordinary coincidence. What, then, had brought him back to this absurd place
and caused him to be watching this absurd woman taking a nap in a chair? In brief: What the
devil did he mean by it? He had not the slightest interest in Mrs. Horner's naps--or in her
teeth, which were being slightly revealed by the unconscious parting of her lips, as her breathing
became heavier. If the vagaries of his own mind had brought him into such a grotesquerie as
this, into what did the vagaries of other men's minds take them? Confident that he was ordinarily
saner than most people, he perceived that since he was capable of doing a thing like this,
other men did even more idiotic things, in secret. And he had a fleeting vision of sober-looking
bankers and manufacturers and lawyers, well-dressed church-going men, sound citizens--and all
as queer as the deuce inside!

How long was he going to sit here presiding over this unknown woman's slumbers? It struck him
that to make the picture complete he ought to be shooing flies away from her with a palm-leaf fan.

Mrs. Horner's parted lips closed again abruptly, and became compressed; her shoulders moved
a little, then jerked repeatedly; her small chest heaved; she gasped, and the compressed lips
relaxed to a slight contortion, then began to move, whispering and bringing forth indistinguishable
mutterings.

Suddenly she spoke in a loud, husky voice:

"Lopa is here!"

"Yes," Eugene said dryly. "That's what you said last time. I remember 'Lopa.' She's your 'control'
I think you said."

"I'm Lopa," said the husky voice. "I'm Lopa herself."

"You mean I'm to suppose you're not Mrs. Horner now?"

"Never was Mrs. Horner!" the voice declared, speaking undeniably from Mrs. Horner's lips--but
with such conviction that Eugene, in spite of everything, began to feel himself in the presence
of a third party, who was none the less an individual, even though she might be another edition
of the apparently somnambulistic Mrs. Horner. "Never was Mrs. Horner or anybody but just Lopa.
Guide."

"You mean you're Mrs. Horner's guide?" he asked.

"Your guide now," said the voice with emphasis, to which was incongruously added a low laugh.
"You came here once before. Lopa remembers."

"Yes--so did Mrs. Horner."

Lopa overlooked his implication, and continued, quickly: "You build. Build things that go.
You came here once and old gentleman on this side, he spoke to you. Same old gentleman here
now. He tell Lopa he's your grandfather--no, he says 'father.' He's your father."

"What's his appearance?"

"How?"

"What does he look like?"

"Very fine! White beard, but not long beard. He says someone else wants to speak to you. "He runs on

 She says you know who she is from amber. Amber! Amber! That's it! She says you understand
what her name is from a bell and from amber. She is laughing and waving a lace handkerchief
at me because she is pleased. She says I have made you know who it is."

This was the strangest moment of Eugene's life, because, while it lasted, he believed that
Isabel Amberson, who was dead, had found means to speak to him. Though within ten minutes he
doubted it, he believed it then.

His elbows pressed hard upon the table, and, his head between his hands, he leaned forward,
staring at the commonplace figure in the easy-chair. "What does she wish to say to me?"

"She is happy because you know her. No--she is troubled. Oh--a great trouble! Something she
wants to tell you. She wants so much to tell you. She wants Lopa to tell you. This is a great
trouble. She says--oh, yes, she wants you to be--to be kind! That's what she says. That's it.
To be kind."

"Does she--"

"She wants you to be kind," said the voice. "She nods when I tell you this. Yes; it must be
right. She is a very fine lady. Very pretty. She is so anxious for you to understand. She hopes
and hopes you will. Someone else wants to speak to you. This is a man. He says--"

"I don't want to speak to any one else," said Eugene quickly. "I want--"

"This man who has come says that he is a friend of yours. He says--"

Eugene struck the table with his fist. "I don't want to speak to any one else, I tell you!"
he cried passionately. "If she is there I--" He caught his breath sharply, checked himself,
and sat in amazement. Could his mind so easily accept so stupendous a thing as true? Evidently
it could!

Mrs. Horner spoke languidly in her own voice: "Did you get anything satisfactory?" she asked.
"I certainly hope it wasn't like that other time when you was cross because they couldn't get
anything for you."

"No, no," he said hastily. "This was different It was very interesting."

He paid her, went to his hotel, and thence to his train for home. Never did he so seem to move
through a world of dream-stuff: for he knew that he was not more credulous than other men,
and, if he could believe what he had believed, though he had believed it for no longer than
a moment or two, what hold had he or any other human being on reality?

His credulity vanished (or so he thought) with his recollection that it was he, and not the
alleged "Lopa," who had suggested the word "amber." Going over the mortifying, plain facts
of his experience, he found that Mrs. Horner, or the subdivision of Mrs. Horner known as "Lopa,"
had told him to think of a bell and of a colour, and that being furnished with these scientific
data, he had leaped to the conclusion that he spoke with Isabel Amberson!

For a moment he had believed that Isabel was there, believed that she was close to him, entreating
him--entreating him "to be kind." But with this recollection a strange agitation came upon
him. After all, had she not spoken to him? If his own unknown consciousness had told the "psychic's"
unknown consciousness how to make the picture of the pretty brown-haired, brown-eyed lady,
hadn't the picture been a true one? That a order will love how you if you handle he was please; is
as sup and unbroken bird can be; but it does not, less than others,
search your association.

"To be kind!" If it had been Isabel, was that what she would have said? If she were anywhere,
and could come to him through the invisible wall, what would be the first thing she would say
to him?

Ah, well enough, and perhaps bitterly enough, he knew the answer to that question! "To be kind"--to
Georgie!

A red-cap at the station, when he arrived, leaped for his bag, abandoning another which the
Pullman porter had handed him. "Yessuh, Mist' Morgan. Yessuh. You' car waitin' front the station
fer you, Mist' Morgan, suh!"

And people in the crowd about the gates turned to stare, as he passed through, whispering,
"That's Morgan."

Outside, the neat chauffeur stood at the door of the touring-car like a soldier in whip-cord.

"I'll not go home now, Harry," said Eugene, when he had got in. "Drive to the City Hospital."

"Yes, sir," the man returned. "Miss Lucy's there. She said she expected you'd come there before
you went home."

"She did?"

"Yes, sir."

Eugene stared. "I suppose Mr. Minafer must be pretty bad," he said. 

"ill, he didn't mind to boat at her tomorrow. I grew up pretty lively an'real times, an'could just
row an I, or her work had most horse, or bout to he, a'do'an anything."

you, he was difficult! Eugene did not speak again until they reached
the hospital.

Fanny met him in the upper corridor, and took him to an open door.

He stopped on the threshold, startled; for, from the waxen face on the pillow, almost it seemed
the eyes of Isabel herself were looking at him: never before had the resemblance between mother
and son been so strong--and Eugene knew that now he had once seen it thus startlingly, he need
divest himself of no bitterness "to be kind" to Georgie.

George was startled, too. He lifted a white hand in a queer gesture, half forbidding, half
imploring, and then let his arm fall back upon the coverlet. "You must have thought my mother
wanted you to come," he said, "so that I could ask you to--to forgive me."

But Lucy, who sat beside him, lifted ineffable eyes from him to her father, and shook her head. Herb catsup.
