It was worth a pilgrimage to see.  Everything is on so gigantic a scale. Nothing is small--nothing
is cheap.  The statues are all large; the palace is grand; the park covers a fair-sized county;
the avenues are interminable.  All the distances and all the dimensions about Versailles are
vast.  I used to think the pictures exaggerated these distances and these dimensions beyond
all reason, and that they made Versailles more beautiful than it was possible for any place
in the world to be.  I know now that the pictures never came up to the subject in any respect,
and that no painter could represent Versailles on canvas as beautiful as it is in reality.
I used to abuse Louis XIV for spending two hundred millions of dollars in creating this marvelous
park, when bread was so scarce with some of his subjects; but I have forgiven him now.  He
took a tract of land sixty miles in circumference and set to work to make this park and build
this palace and a road to it from Paris.  He kept 36,000 men employed daily on it, and the
labor was so unhealthy that they used to die and be hauled off by cartloads every night.  The
wife of a nobleman of the time speaks of this as an "inconvenience," but naively remarks that
"it does not seem worthy of attention in the happy state of tranquillity we now enjoy."

I always thought ill of people at home who trimmed their shrubbery into pyramids and squares
and spires and all manner of unnatural shapes, and when I saw the same thing being practiced
in this great park I began to feel dissatisfied.  But I soon saw the idea of the thing and
the wisdom of it.  They seek the general effect.  We distort a dozen sickly trees into unaccustomed
shapes in a little yard no bigger than a dining room, and then surely they look absurd enough.
But here they take two hundred thousand tall forest trees and set them in a double row; allow
no sign of leaf or branch to grow on the trunk lower down than six feet above the ground; from
that point the boughs begin to project, and very gradually they extend outward further and
further till they meet overhead, and a faultless tunnel of foliage is formed.  The arch is
mathematically precise.  The effect is then very fine.  They make trees take fifty different
shapes, and so these quaint effects are infinitely varied and picturesque.  The trees in no
two avenues are shaped alike, and consequently the eye is not fatigued with anything in the
nature of monotonous uniformity.  I will drop this subject now, leaving it to others to determine
how these people manage to make endless ranks of lofty forest trees grow to just a certain
thickness of trunk (say a foot and two-thirds); how they make them spring to precisely the
same height for miles; how they make them grow so close together; how they compel one huge
limb to spring from the same identical spot on each tree and form the main sweep of the arch;
and how all these things are kept exactly in the same condition and in the same exquisite shapeliness
and symmetry month after month and year after year--for I have tried to reason out the problem
and have failed.

And this ingenious Napoleon paves the streets of his great cities with a smooth, compact composition
of asphaltum and sand.  No more barricades of flagstones--no more assaulting his Majesty's
troops with cobbles.  I cannot feel friendly toward my quondam fellow-American, Napoleon III.,
especially at this time,--[July, 1867.]--when in fancy I see his credulous victim, Maximilian,
lying stark and stiff in Mexico, and his maniac widow watching eagerly from her French asylum
for the form that will never come--but I do admire his nerve, his calm self-reliance, his shrewd
good sense.

CHAPTER XVII.

We had a pleasant journey of it seaward again.  We found that for the three past nights our
ship had been in a state of war.  The first night the sailors of a British ship, being happy
with grog, came down on the pier and challenged our sailors to a free fight.  They accepted
with alacrity, repaired to the pier, and gained--their share of a drawn battle.  Several bruised
and bloody members of both parties were carried off by the police and imprisoned until the
following morning.  The next night the British boys came again to renew the fight, but our
men had had strict orders to remain on board and out of sight.  They did so, and the besieging
party grew noisy and more and more abusive as the fact became apparent (to them) that our men
were afraid to come out.  They went away finally with a closing burst of ridicule and offensive
epithets.  The third night they came again and were more obstreperous than ever.  They swaggered
up and down the almost deserted pier, and hurled curses, obscenity, and stinging sarcasms at
our crew.  It was more than human nature could bear.  The executive officer ordered our men
ashore--with instructions not to fight.  They charged the British and gained a brilliant victory.
I probably would not have mentioned this war had it ended differently.  But I travel to learn,
and I still remember that they picture no French defeats in the battle-galleries of Versailles.

It was like home to us to step on board the comfortable ship again and smoke and lounge about
her breezy decks.  And yet it was not altogether like home, either, because so many members
of the family were away.  We missed some pleasant faces which we would rather have found at
dinner, and at night there were gaps in the euchre-parties which could not be satisfactorily
filled.  "Moult"  was in England, Jack in Switzerland, Charley in Spain.  Blucher was gone,
none could tell where.  But we were at sea again, and we had the stars and the ocean to look
at, and plenty of room to meditate in.

In due time the shores of Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing from the decks, early
in the bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa rose up out of the sea and flung back
the sunlight from her hundred palaces.

Here we rest for the present--or rather, here we have been trying to rest, for some little
time, but we run about too much to accomplish a great deal in that line.

I would like to remain here.  I had rather not go any further.  There may be prettier women
in Europe, but I doubt it.  The population of Genoa is 120,000; two-thirds of these are women,
I think, and at least two-thirds of the women are beautiful.  They are as dressy and as tasteful
and as graceful as they could possibly be without being angels.  However, angels are not very
dressy, I believe.  At least the angels in pictures are not --they wear nothing but wings.
But these Genoese women do look so charming.  Most of the young demoiselles are robed in a
cloud of white from head to foot, though many trick themselves out more elaborately. Nine-tenths
of them wear nothing on their heads but a filmy sort of veil, which falls down their backs
like a white mist.  They are very fair, and many of them have blue eyes, but black and dreamy
dark brown ones are met with oftenest.

The ladies and gentlemen of Genoa have a pleasant fashion of promenading in a large park on
the top of a hill in the center of the city, from six till nine in the evening, and then eating
ices in a neighboring garden an hour or two longer.  We went to the park on Sunday evening.
Two thousand persons were present, chiefly young ladies and gentlemen.  The gentlemen were
dressed in the very latest Paris fashions, and the robes of the ladies glinted among the trees
like so many snowflakes.  The multitude moved round and round the park in a great procession.
The bands played, and so did the fountains; the moon and the gas lamps lit up the scene, and
altogether it was a brilliant and an animated picture.  I scanned every female face that passed,
and it seemed to me that all were handsome.  I never saw such a freshet of loveliness before.
I did not see how a man of only ordinary decision of character could marry here, because before
he could get his mind made up he would fall in love with somebody else.

Never smoke any Italian tobacco.  Never do it on any account.  It makes me shudder to think
what it must be made of.  You cannot throw an old cigar "stub" down anywhere, but some vagabond
will pounce upon it on the instant.  I like to smoke a good deal, but it wounds my sensibilities
to see one of these stub-hunters watching me out of the corners of his hungry eyes and calculating
how long my cigar will be likely to last. It reminded me too painfully of that San Francisco
undertaker who used to go to sick-beds with his watch in his hand and time the corpse.  One
of these stub-hunters followed us all over the park last night, and we never had a smoke that
was worth anything.  We were always moved to appease him with the stub before the cigar was
half gone, because he looked so viciously anxious.  He regarded us as his own legitimate prey,
by right of discovery, I think, because he drove off several other professionals who wanted
to take stock in us.

Now, they surely must chew up those old stubs, and dry and sell them for smoking-tobacco. 
Therefore, give your custom to other than Italian brands of the article.

"The Superb" and the "City of Palaces" are names which Genoa has held for centuries.  She is
full of palaces, certainly, and the palaces are sumptuous inside, but they are very rusty without
and make no pretensions to architectural magnificence.  "Genoa the Superb" would be a felicitous
title if it referred to the women.

We have visited several of the palaces--immense thick-walled piles, with great stone staircases,
tesselated marble pavements on the floors, (sometimes they make a mosaic work, of intricate
designs, wrought in pebbles or little fragments of marble laid in cement,) and grand salons
hung with pictures by Rubens, Guido, Titian, Paul Veronese, and so on, and portraits of heads
of the family, in plumed helmets and gallant coats of mail, and patrician ladies in stunning
costumes of centuries ago. But, of course, the folks were all out in the country for the summer,
and might not have known enough to ask us to dinner if they had been at home, and so all the
grand empty salons, with their resounding pavements, their grim pictures of dead ancestors,
and tattered banners with the dust of bygone centuries upon them, seemed to brood solemnly
of death and the grave, and our spirits ebbed away, and our cheerfulness passed from us. We
never went up to the eleventh story.  We always began to suspect ghosts. In one of coating was

  One family built the whole edifice, and have got money
left.  There is where the mystery lies.  We had an idea at first that only a mint could have
survived the expense.

These people here live in the heaviest, highest, broadest, darkest, solidest houses one can
imagine.  Each one might "laugh a siege to scorn."  A hundred feet front and a hundred high
is about the style, and you go up three flights of stairs before you begin to come upon signs
of occupancy.  Everything is stone, and stone of the heaviest--floors, stairways, mantels,
benches--everything.  The walls are four to five feet thick.  The streets generally are four
or five to eight feet wide and as crooked as a corkscrew.  You go along one of these gloomy
cracks, and look up and behold the sky like a mere ribbon of light, far above your head, where
the tops of the tall houses on either side of the street bend almost together.  You feel as
if you were at the bottom of some tremendous abyss, with all the world far above you.  You
wind in and out and here and there, in the most mysterious way, and have no more idea of the
points of the compass than if you were a blind man.  You can never persuade yourself that these
are actually streets, and the frowning, dingy, monstrous houses dwellings, till you see one
of these beautiful, prettily dressed women emerge from them--see her emerge from a dark, dreary-looking
den that looks dungeon all over, from the ground away halfway up to heaven.  And then you wonder
that such a charming moth could come from such a forbidding shell as that.  The streets are
wisely made narrow and the houses heavy and thick and stony, in order that the people may be
cool in this roasting climate.  And they are cool, and stay so.  And while I think of it--the
men wear hats and have very dark complexions, but the women wear no headgear but a flimsy veil
like a gossamer's web, and yet are exceedingly fair as a general thing. Singular, isn't it?

The huge palaces of Genoa are each supposed to be occupied by one family, but they could accommodate
a hundred, I should think.  They are relics of the grandeur of Genoa's palmy days--the days
when she was a great commercial and maritime power several centuries ago.  These houses, solid
marble palaces though they be, are in many cases of a dull pinkish color, outside, and from
pavement to eaves are pictured with Genoese battle scenes, with monstrous Jupiters and Cupids,
and with familiar illustrations from Grecian mythology.  Where the paint has yielded to age
and exposure and is peeling off in flakes and patches, the effect is not happy.  A noseless
Cupid or a Jupiter with an eye out or a Venus with a fly-blister on her breast, are not attractive
features in a picture. Some of these painted walls reminded me somewhat of the tall van, plastered
with fanciful bills and posters, that follows the bandwagon of a circus about a country village.
I have not read or heard that the outsides of the houses of any other European city are frescoed
in this way.

I can not conceive of such a thing as Genoa in ruins. There we love of the ramifications of art
be done to the heaviest gas from the metropolis to the great dell but Maintenon, in whose prodigality
where you might imagine yourself the hundred town, were he had not for the hum in a paving that
is plotting and working at a distance.

The republics of Genoa and Pisa were very powerful in the Middle Ages. Their ships filled the
Mediterranean, and they carried on an extensive commerce with Constantinople and Syria.  Their
warehouses were the great distributing depots from whence the costly merchandise of the East
was sent abroad over Europe.  They were warlike little nations and defied, in those days, governments
that overshadow them now as mountains overshadow molehills. The j. A b. C. a Sovereign for 1820;

LLEWELLYN. Will think this address, that we may forward a communication which did we have received
along which do it?  They were victorious at last and divided their conquests equably among their great
patrician families.  Descendants of some of those proud families still inhabit the palaces
of Genoa, and trace in their own features a resemblance to the grim knights whose portraits
hang in their stately halls, and to pictured beauties with pouting lips and merry eyes whose
originals have been dust and ashes for many a dead and forgotten century.

The hotel we live in belonged to one of those great orders of knights of the Cross in the times
of the Crusades, and its mailed sentinels once kept watch and ward in its massive turrets and
woke the echoes of these halls and corridors with their iron heels.

or pisa.



We are ready to move again, though we are not really tired yet of the narrow passages of this
old marble cave.  Cave is a good word--when speaking of Genoa under the stars.  When we have
been prowling at midnight through the gloomy crevices they call streets, where no footfalls
but ours were echoing, where only ourselves were abroad, and lights appeared only at long intervals
and at a distance, and mysteriously disappeared again, and the houses at our elbows seemed
to stretch upward farther than ever toward the heavens, the memory of a cave I used to know
at home was always in my mind, with its lofty passages, its silence and solitude, its shrouding
gloom, its sepulchral echoes, its flitting lights, and more than all, its sudden revelations
of branching crevices and corridors where we least expected them. 

Of bottom, because we hate than an coach and have been alone, because we have merely our the machinery
on refer, and there is own stroll and lose of "making up minds." We hate the leisure to prowling at
London-- on foot and occasional.  But we must go, nevertheless.
