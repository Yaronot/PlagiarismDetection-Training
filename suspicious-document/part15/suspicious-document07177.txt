The only new allegation made was that the amendment recommended by the Senate committee on
finance, to strike out the franc dollar of 384 grains, provided for in the bill as it came
from the House, and insert the trade dollar, was not agreed to in the Senate, but that the
change was made in committee of conference, and passed without the knowledge of the Senate.
A conclusive answer was made to this statement by the production, from the files of the secretary's
office, of the original bill as it stood after its passage in the Senate and before it was
sent to conference.  As similar statements have been frequently made, I reproduce the portion
of this original bill showing the section in question, with the printer's note accompanying
the bill explaining the different type used in printing it.  The word "AGREED" on the bill
is in the handwriting of the journal clerk of the Senate, Mr. McDonald, who held that position
many years until his death.  It shows that the Senate adopted the recommendation of the committee
on finance before the bill was sent to conference.  This amendment was agreed to by the House
conferees.

  I believe a majority of the Senate desire, first, to provide an increase of
money to meet the increasing wants of our rapidly growing country and population, and to supply
the reduction in our circulation caused by the retiring of national bank notes; second, to
increase the market value of silver, not only in the United States, but in the world, in the
belief that this is essential to the success of any measure proposed, and in the hope that
our efforts will advance silver to its legal ratio with gold, and induce the great commercial
nations to join with us in maintaining the legal parity of the two metals, or in agreeing with
us in a new ratio of their relative value; and, third, to secure a genuine bimetallic standard,
one that will not demonetize gold or cause it to be hoarded or exported, but that will establish
both gold and silver as standards of value, not only in the United States, but among all the
civilized nations of the world.

"Believing that these are the chief objects aimed at by us all, and that we differ only as
to the best means to obtain them, I will discuss the pending propositions to test how far they
tend, in my opinion, to promote or defeat these objects."

Those of us who were in favor of good money, whether of gold or silver, or whether issued by
the government in the form of notes or currency by the national banks, all to be maintained
at par with each other and of equal purchasing power, were constantly charged with reducing
the volume of money.  I showed that since the resumption of specie payments, January 1, 1879,
there had been a constant annual increase in the total circulating medium of the country. I
furnished a table showing the steady increase of circulation during the period named, which
I here insert:

*Includes outstanding clearing house certificates of the act of June 8, 1872.

Meanwhile, the House passed a bill of like import to the one under consideration in the Senate,
differing therefrom mainly in that it made the notes to be issued a full legal tender, and
authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to redeem them in gold coin or silver bullion at current
market rate.  When this bill reached the Senate it was, by unanimous consent, accepted as a
substitute for the Senate bill, and the discussion of the measure continued, occupying much
of the time and attention of the Senate until June 17, 1890, when a vote was taken on an amendment
proposed by Senator Plumb to strike out the first section authorizing the issue of notes and
inserting the following:

"That from and after the date of the passage of this act, the unit of value in the United States
shall be the dollar, and the same may be coined of 412½ grains of standard silver, or of 25.8
grains of standard gold, and the said coins shall be legal tender for all debts, public and
private.

"That hereafter any owner of silver or gold bullion may deposit the same in any mint of the
United States, to be formed into standard dollars, or bars, for his benefit, and without charge,
but it shall be lawful to refuse any deposit of less value than $100, or any bullion so base
as to be unsuitable for the operations of the mint."

This amendment was adopted by a vote of 43 to 24, the yeas being made up of Democrats and the
Republicans from the silver producing states.

The adoption of this free silver amendment clearly indicated that a large majority of the Senate
favored the free coinage of silver at the ratio of sixteen to one.

The other sections of the bill were then made to harmonize with this new provision, and the
bill was passed and returned to the House, where the amendments were nonconcurred in, and a
conference asked for.

The Senate granted this request, and Senators Sherman, Jones, of Nevada, and Harris were appointed
to meet Representatives Conger, Walker, and Bland, of the House, in conference, to adjust the
wide disagreements.  On July 7 a bill agreed upon in conference was reported to the Senate,
Messrs. Harris and Bland not joining in the report.  The bill agreed to became a law July 12,
1890, and was as follows:

"That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby directed to purchase, from time to time, silver
bullion to the aggregate amount of 4,500,000 ounces, or as much thereof as may be offered in
each month, at the market price thereof, not exceeding one dollar for 371.25 grains of pure
silver, and to issue, in payment for such purchases of silver bullion, treasury notes of the
United States to be prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury, in such form and of such denominations,
not less than one dollar nor more than $1,000, as he may prescribe, and a sum sufficient to
carry into effect the provisions of this act is hereby appropriated out of any money in the
treasury not otherwise appropriated.

"Sec. 2.  That the treasury notes issued in accordance with the provisions of this act shall
be redeemable on demand, in coin, at the treasury of the United States or at the office of
any assistant treasurer of the United States, and when so redeemed may be reissued; but no
greater or less amount of such notes shall be outstanding at any time than the cost of the
silver bullion, and the standard silver dollars coined therefrom, then held in the treasury,
purchased by such notes; and such treasury notes shall be a legal tender in payment of all
debts, public and private, except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract, and
shall be receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues, and when so received may be reissued;
and such notes, when held by any national banking association, may be counted as a part of
its lawful reserve.  That, upon demand of the holder of any of the treasury notes herein provided
for, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, under such regulations as he may prescribe, redeem
such notes in gold or silver coin, at his discretion, it being the established policy of the
United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with each other upon the present legal
ratio, or such ratio as may be provided by law.

"Sec. 3.  That the Secretary of the Treasury shall each month coin 2,000,000 ounces of the
silver bullion purchased under the provisions of this act into standard silver dollars until
the 1st day of July, 1891, and after that time he shall coin of the silver bullion purchased
under the provisions of this act as much as may be necessary to provide for the redemption
of the treasury notes herein provided for, and any gain or seigniorage arising from such coinage
shall be accounted for and paid into the treasury.

"Sec. 4.  That the silver bullion purchased under the provisions of this act shall be subject
to the requirements of existing law and the regulations of the mint service governing the methods
of determining the amount of pure silver contained, and the amount of charges or deductions,
if any, to be made.

"Sec. 5.

"Sec. 6. That upon the passage of this act the balances standing with the treasurer of the
United States to the respective credits of national banks, for deposits made to redeem the
circulating notes of such banks, and all deposits thereafter received for like purpose, shall
be converted into the treasury as a miscellaneous receipt, and the treasurer of the United
States shall redeem, from the general cash in the treasury, the circulating notes of said banks
which may come into his possession subject to redemption; and upon the certificate of the comptroller
of the currency that such notes have been received by him, and that they have been destroyed
and that no new notes will be issued in their place, reimbursement of their amount shall be
made to the treasurer, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe,
from an appropriation hereby created, to be known as 'National bank notes:  Redemption account,'
but the provisions of this act shall not apply to the deposits received under section 3 of
the act of June 20, 1874, requiring every national bank to keep in lawful money, with the treasurer
of the United States, a sum equal to five per cent. of its circulation, to be held and used
for the redemption of its circulating notes; and the balance remaining of the deposit so covered
shall, at the close of each month, be reported on the monthly public debt statement as debt
of the United States bearing no interest.

"Sec. 7.  That this act shall take effect thirty days from and after its passage."

The authorship of this law has been generally credited to me, and it was commonly called the
"Sherman silver law," though I took but little part in framing the legislation until the bill
got into conference.  The situation at that time was critical.  A large majority of the Senate
favored free silver, and it was feared that the small majority against it in the other House
might yield and agree to it.  The silence of the President on the matter gave rise to an apprehension
that if a free coinage bill should pass both Houses he would not feel at liberty to veto it.
Some action had to be taken to prevent a return to free silver coinage, and the measure evolved
was the best obtainable.  I voted for it, but the day it became a law I was ready to repeal
it, if repeal could be had without substituting in its place absolute free coinage.

It will be noticed that the act varied greatly from the House bill before the free coinage
amendment was attached.  The amount of silver bullion to be purchased was changed from $4,500,000
worth per month to 4,500,000 ounces per month.  This change, owing to the fall in price of
silver, not then anticipated, greatly reduced the quantity to be purchased.  The House conferees
yielded reluctantly to the striking out of the section in the bill providing for the redemption
of the notes in bullion, a plan that had been urged by Secretary Windom.  In lieu thereof,
however, a clause declaring that it was the purpose of the government to maintain the parity
of the metals was inserted.  This was a most important amendment and one that has been generally
accepted as indicating the purpose of the country to maintain all dollars at par with each other.

The chief merit of this law was that it suspended the peremptory coinage of the silver purchased
under it into silver dollars which could not be circulated, but were hoarded in the treasury
at great cost and inconvenience.  It required the monthly purchase of a greater amount of silver
than before, but that could be held in the form of bullion, and could be paid for by treasury
notes equal in amount to the cost of the bullion, the whole of which was held in the treasury
as security for the payment of the notes.  If silver bullion did not decline in market value
it could, if necessary, be coined without loss, and thus the parity of the notes with gold
could be readily maintained according to the declared policy of the law. But you'credit be the first,
prevent the; and the inventor often has some ll. "nothing that has been done or will be done ever can remember
other managers from each theatrical. It'said s chronic." there isn't,
"said each pioneer.  I did not believe
this but hoped that it would not decline in value, and, in any event, it was better to stop
the compulsory coinage of the bullion into dollars, as to force them into circulation would
reduce the purchasing power of the dollar and bring the United States to the single standard
of silver. Being compelled to choose between the measure proposed and the free coinage of silver
I preferred the former, and voted for the bill and, thus, with others, became responsible for it.

Contrary to the expectation of the friends of silver it steadily declined in market value.
The compulsory purchase of the enormous aggregate of fifty-four million ounces, or 2,250 tons
Troy, each year, did not maintain the market value of silver, but it steadily declined so that
the silver purchased each year entailed an annual loss of more than $10,000,000.

When the result became apparent I was anxious to arrest the purchase of silver, and I never
could comprehend why anyone not directly interested in the mining of silver could favor a policy
involving so heavy a loss to the people of the United States.  Long before the second election
of Mr. Cleveland I advocated the repeal of what became known as the "Sherman act," and heartily
supported and voted for the repeal he recommended.

In the previous Congress I had introduced a bill "to declare unlawful, trusts and combinations
in restraint of trade and production," but no action was taken upon it.  On the 4th of December
I again introduced this bill, it being the first Senate bill introduced in that Congress. 
It was referred to the committee on finance, and, having been reported back with amendments,
I called it up on the 27th of February, and said that I did not intend to make any extended
remarks upon it unless it should become necessary to do so.  Senator George made a long and
carefully prepared speech, from which it appeared that while he favored the general purpose
of the bill he objected to it on the ground that it was not constitutional.  This objection
was shared by several Senators. I subsequently reported from the committee on finance a substitute
for the bill, and on the 21st of March made a long speech in support of it in which I said:

"I did not originally intend to make any extended argument on the trust bill, because I supposed
that the public facts upon which it is founded and the general necessity of some legislation
were so manifest that no debate was necessary to bring those facts to the attention of the Senate.

"But the different views taken by Senators in regard to the legal questions involved in this
bill, and the very able speech made by the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. George] relative to
the details of the bill, led me to the conclusion that it was my duty, having reported the
bill from the committee on finance, to present, in as clear and logical a way as I can, the
legal and practical questions involved in the bill.

"The object of the bill, as shown by the title, is 'to declare unlawful, trusts and combinations
in restraint of trade and production.'  It declares that certain contracts are against public
policy, null and void.  It does not announce a new principle of law, but applies old and well-recognized
principles of the common law to the complicated jurisdiction of our state and federal government.
Similar contracts in any state in the Union are now, by common or statute law, null and void.
Each state can and does prevent and control combinations within the limit of the state. This
we do not propose to interfere with.  The power of the state courts has been repeatedly exercised
to set aside such combinations as I shall hereafter show, but these courts are limited in their
jurisdiction to the state, and, in our complex system of government, are admitted to be unable
to deal with the great evil that now threatens us. 

"Listen this," I hoped.

"you'it was heard it reduce them," Them said, "i'power understand Them prevent it decline it."
It bring stoutly be better able into listen them would be better
able to read into letter if you didn't bring it hoped in bullion.

"
  They not only affect our commerce with foreign nations, but trade and transportation
among the several states.  The purpose of this bill is to enable the courts of the United States
to apply the same remedies against combinations which injuriously affect the interests of the
United States that have been applied in the several states to protect local interests.
