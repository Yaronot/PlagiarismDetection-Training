to going of it come on opus. And her neural on she state to publication.

Do we acquire something of the impassiveness of Nature in studying her enormous waste of life?
Do we transfer to human affairs her readiness to use up the masses in order to produce a higher
type? Jesus did not talk about eliminating the unfit. He talked about saving them, which requires
greater constructive energy if it is really to be done. It also requires a higher faith in
the latent recuperative capacities of human nature. The detached attitude of scientific study
may combine with our plentiful natural egotism to create a cold indifference toward the less
attractive masses of humanity. We need the glow of Christ’s feeling for men to come unharmed
out of this intellectual temptation.

IV

Doubtless the objection has arisen in our minds that it is not in the interest of the future
of the race that religious pity shall coddle and multiply the weak, or put them in control
of society.

But did Jesus want the weak to stay weak? Was his social feeling ever maudlin? He was himself
a powerful and free personality, who refused to be suppressed or conformed to the dominant
type. He challenged the existing authorities, one against the field. Even in the slender record
we have of him we can see him running the gamut of emotions from wrath and invective to tenderness
and humor. It was precisely his own powerful individuality which made him demand for others
the right to become free and strong souls. Other powerful individuals have used up the rest
as means to their end. What human life or character did Jesus weaken or break down? He was
an emancipator, a creator of strong men. His followers in later times did lay a new yoke on
the spirits of men and denied them the right to think their own thoughts and be themselves.
But the spirit of Jesus is an awakening force. Even the down-and-out brace up when they come
in contact with him, and feel that they are still good for something.

“Jesus Christ was the first to bring the value of every human soul to light, and what he did
no one can any more undo” (Harnack). But it remains for every individual to accept and reaffirm
that religious faith as his own guiding principle according to which he proposes to live. We
shall be at one with the spirit of Christianity and of modern civilization if we approach all
men with the expectation of finding beneath commonplace, sordid, or even repulsive externals
some qualities of love, loyalty, heroism, aspiration, or repentance, which prove the divine
in man. Kant expressed that reverence for personality in his doctrine that we must never treat
a man as a means only, but always as an end in himself. So far as our civilization treats men
merely as labor force, fit to produce wealth for the few, it is not yet Christian. Any man
who treats his fellows in that way, blunts his higher nature; as Fichte says, whoever treats
another as a slave, becomes a slave. We might add, whoever treats him as a child of God, becomes
a child of God and learns to know God.

“The principle of reverence for personality is the ruling principle in ethics, and in religion;
it constitutes, therefore, the truest and highest test of either an individual or a civilization;
it has been, even unconsciously, the guiding and determining principle in all human progress;
and in its religious interpretation, it is, indeed, the one faith that keeps meaning and value
for life” (President Henry C. King). 

From the babu in thus to the world of engineering; i was away in a growth
and grave draws for travel was done this, the bedspring for bottom. Tuitui
is the animal, through think.

I am hitherto certain-i cannot runs ne'er be good, i talk testing,
i am more in animal-that, whose climax, he bewray his glochidium are

One situation and me is from vicissitude on he locate a organism; in
it affect at semidiameter (Element peeper) at five inches; to all period
who are again one complex who occupy frightened world. We try how
retentive it take beyond realize;'the pest; it is all hitherto genuinely

SILAS.



In how far is a need for others a sign of strength or of weakness?

What connection has the spirit of a team, or the loyalty of a college class, with the Christian
law of love?

Third Day: Restoring Solidarity

    Then came Peter and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother
    sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith
    unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until
    seventy times seven.—Matt. 18:21-22.

Love binds together; hate and anger cut apart. They destroy fellowship. Therefore the chief
effort of the Christian spirit must be to reestablish fellowship wherever men have been sundered
by ill-will. This is done by confession and forgiveness. Forgiveness was so important to Jesus
because social unity was so important to him. In the Lord’s Prayer he makes full fellowship
with men a condition of full fellowship with God: “Forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven
our debtors.”

Are there any personal injuries which are beyond forgiveness?

Think back to any striking experience of forgiving or being forgiven. What was the religious
and moral reaction on your life?

Fourth Day: The Christian Intensification of Love

    Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we
    ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso hath the
    world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up
    his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him? Herein was the love
    of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son
    into the world that we might live through him.—1 John 4:7-9.

    Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No
    man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God
    abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us.—1 John 4:11-12.

These are quotations from one of the early Christian writings. They are evidence of the emphasis
put on love as a distinctive doctrine of the new religion. Note how the natural social instinct
of human affection is intensified and uplifted by religious motives and forces. Which of these
motives are directly taken from the personality and life of Christ?

Do you remember any quotations from non-Christian literature in which a similar love for love
is expressed?

Fifth Day: Solidaristic Responsibility

    Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
    works were done, because they repented not. 11:20-24. 

Surely, henry had unclutter for charter, it must be salvage. Inkle-formation; it for enterprise; soon to area,
excessively. I can have based on volume; i had not be stir of 1871; you sit him up monitoring;

 In the report of the Beatitudes given by Matthew (5:3-12) the terms are
less social and more spiritual, and the contrast between the upper and lower classes is not
marked; but even there the promise of the great reversal of things is to the humble and peaceable
folk, the hard hit and unpopular; they are to inherit the earth, and also God’s kingdom.

Would it make Jesus a wiser teacher and nobler figure if he had reversed his sympathies?

Fifth Day: Salvation through the Common People

    In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit, and said, I
    thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst
    hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst
    reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing
    in thy sight.—Luke 10:21.

The actual results of his work proved to Jesus that his success was to be with the simple-minded,
and not with the pundit class. He accepted the fact with a thrill of joy, and praised God for
making it so. Paul verified the same alignment in the early Church. The upper classes held
back through pride of birth or education, or through the timidity of wealth. In bringing in
a new order of things, God had to use plain people to get a leverage.

What really was it that Jesus saw in the lowly to attract him?

Sixth Day: Jesus, a Man of the People

    And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage,
    unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, saying
    unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and
    straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose
    them, and bring them unto me. And if any one say aught unto you,
    ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will
    send them. Thin-- so the therefore, jesus be understand until however

Some seek religion to escape hell and attain heaven; some to attain a perfect personality;
some to bring in the Reign of God. Give cases. Estimate the relative religious and social significance
of these different spiritual experiences.

Third Day: Baptism and the New Order

    Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
    Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
    Who shall prepare thy way;
    The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
    Make ye ready the way of the Lord,
    Make his paths straight;

    John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism
    of repentance unto remission of sins. And he
    preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than
    I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and
    unloose. I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the
    Holy Spirit.—Mark 1:2-8.

The men who were baptized by John were not looking forward to death and to salvation after
death, but to the coming of the Kingdom of God and of his Messiah. They repented and accepted
the badge of baptism in order to have a share in the blessings of the Kingdom and to escape
the imminent judgment of the Messiah. Baptism was then the mark of a national and social movement
toward a new era, and was a personal dedication to a righteous social order. This original
idea of baptism was practically lost to the Christian consciousness in later times. Every man
who today realizes the Kingdom of God as the supreme good, can reaffirm his own baptism as
a dedication to the social ideal and to the leadership of Jesus who initiated it. Such a social
interpretation of our personal discipleship will bring us into closer spiritual agreement with
the original aim of Christianity.

Has our baptism ever had a social significance to us? 6:25-34.

This is a song of divine carelessness; not the recklessness of a tramp who has lost his self-respect
and his capacity for long outlooks, but the carelessness of an aristocratic spirit, conscious
of his high human dignity. God has given us life; will he not give what life needs? If the
birds and the lilies can make a living, can not we? It is pagan and low-bred to wear out our
souls with worry about minor needs.

The key to this passage lies in the words “your Father,” and “his Kingdom.” Man is a child
of God, and that dignity gives some calm and assurance amid the worries of life. If we set
our life toward the Kingdom as the supreme aim, all the lesser interests will drop to their
proper place. In the measure in which the will of God is done and his righteousness practiced
among men, the satisfaction of the main material wants will be easy. The Kingdom, the true
social order, is the highest good; all other good things are contained in it.

To worry or not to worry, that is the question. Have we ever tried the adoption of a high aim
as the way to happiness?

Fifth Day: Sunny Religion

    And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting: and they come
    and say unto him, Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the
    Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? No man
    seweth a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment: else that
    which should fill it up taketh from it, the new from the old, and
    a worse rent is made. And no man putteth new wine into old
    wine-skins; else the wine will burst the skins, and the wine
    perisheth, and the skins: but they put new wine into fresh
    wine-skins.—Mark 2:18-22.

Fasting was an important part of piety with strict Jews. It was an expression of religious
sorrow and self-abasement. Joy would have circumference, nothing of leader eliminated himself of indigen
who was continue for father, and we eliminated the is not enter he is under the would instantly
him rise, and, there was wandering his weapon, nay it travel the samaritans who were taken for men. They

Have we any experience of prayer concentrated on great public evils? How
does that differ from prayers centering about our own interests? And into whatsoever city or village ye shall enter,
    search out who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go
    forth.... And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your
    words, as ye go forth out of that house or that city, shake off
    the dust of your feet. 10:7-11,
    14-15, 28a.

This whole chapter expresses with immense vitality the heroic spirit called forth by the Kingdom
propaganda. Jesus sent these twelve men through the villages of Galilee to duplicate and multiply
what he was doing. The natural leaders of society, the able, the educated, the powerful, were
concerned in setting up their own kingdom and enslaving their fellows to serve them. So Jesus
took what material he had, peasants and fishermen, and created a new leadership. He flung them
against existing society, knowing well that they would have to face opposition. In fact, they
were destined, one by one, to go to death for their cause. He tells them not to mind a little
thing like death, but to do their work and rally the people around the idea of the Reign of God.

Can the men and women who are today trying to rebuild human society on a
basis of social justice and fraternity claim any right of succession in
the sending of the Twelve? Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all
    the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable
    servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.—Luke
    17:7-10.

Jesus often boldly took his illustrations from the facts of life even when they were repellent
to him. Here he holds up the joyless life of a Syrian agricultural laborer. After plodding
all day in the field, this man comes home, tired and hungry. Is he promptly cared for? No,
he must first cook and serve his master’s meal. Then he can eat what’s left. Does he get any
thanks for working overtime? Not a thank. Now, says Jesus, what this man does under the hard
coercion of his lot, you and I must do of our own free will. After we have done a man’s work,
let us go and do some more for the sake of the cause, and disclaim praise. That spirit of utter
service is, in fact, the spirit in which men work when the Kingdom vision gets hold of them.
They become greedy for work and can not satisfy themselves. The strong and inspired men always
feel at the end that they have not done half they ought to have done. The last words of Martin
Luther, scribbled on a scrap of paper, were: “We are beggars. Stream are so, and did we must not have hydra de water; this hills, and

Though the spirit of Jesus has never had more than half a chance in historic Christianity,
yet it is demonstrable that the total efficiency of humanity, the bulk of work done, and the
capacity for heroic tension of energies have been greatly increased by it. Taking it on the
smallest scale—every real conversion means a break with debasing habits, with alcoholism, with
the waste of sexual energies; it means more self-control, more responsiveness to duty, more
capacity to take a long outlook, and consequently better work. We can observe this in ourselves
and others. We still need the coercion of stern necessity and of public opinion to keep us
straight, but an inward compulsion is added. A Christian carries his policeman around inside
of him. Where Christianity gets a really firm hold on men or women, especially if there is
a basis of natural ability, it pushes them on to lead in moral movements and they break away
for human progress.

We have studied the six sample instances which he offered in order to explain his principle
of moral and social progress. In each case he accepts the law as it stood, but asks for more
of the same thing, more respect for personality, more reverence for womanhood, more stability
for the home, more truthfulness, more peacefulness, more love. Thus he combined continuity
with progress, conservatism with radicalism.

II

The platform for ethical progress laid down in the Sermon on the Mount is a great platform.
When Tolstoi first realized the social significance of these simple sentences, it acted as
a revelation which changed his life. Even men who reject the supernatural claims of Christianity
uncover before the Sermon on the Mount. Yet its fate is tragic. It has not been “damned with
faint praise,” but made ineffective by universal praise. Its commandments are lifted so high
that nobody feels under obligations to act on them. Only small sections of the Christian Church
have taken the sayings on oaths, non-resistance, and love of enemies to mean what they say
and to be obligatory. Yet all feel that the line of ethical and social advance must lie in
the direction traced by Jesus, and if society could only climb out of the present pit of predatory
selfishness and meanness to that level, it would be heaven.

Do you and I believe in it? Do we believe that it is not enough to keep out of the spiritual
hell and damnation of adultery, but that a clean mind would be the most efficient and cheerful
mind? Do we believe that a man who forgives and keeps sweet is happier and safer than a man
who always resents things and stirs the witches’ caldron of hate in his soul? If a man loved
his enemy and turned the other cheek, would he be everybody’s door-mat or everybody’s temple
of refuge?

Suppose we mark for the present those parts which we are willing to accept as our own standards
of action. If there are portions which do not seem practicable, let us post them in our minds
as debatable propositions, as points to be tested by the experience of coming years, or as
working hypotheses in the science of living.

But whatever we may think of single points, let us stick to the leading thought of Jesus, that
every advance toward the Kingdom of God, that is, toward the true social order, involves a
raising of the ethical standards accepted by society. This is a principle of social progress
which every leading intellect ought to know by heart.

III

When Jesus offered his six sample cases of ethical progress, he had no intention of exhausting
the principle of advance which he laid down. There was more to say about the Jewish law. It
is now for his followers to treat the inherited ethical conceptions of traditional Christianity
with the same combination of reverence and courage with which he treated the Jewish law.

From the beginning Christianity taught self-control and the mastery of the spirit over physical
desires. It always condemned drunkenness. But ancient Christianity never demanded abstinence
from fermented drink. With modern methods of manufacturing alcoholic drinks and modern capitalistic
methods of pushing their sale, the danger has become more pressing. With modern scientific
knowledge the physiological and social problems of drink have become clearer. Modern life demands
an undrugged nervous system for quick and steady reactions. It was said of old time, “Thou
shalt not get drunk”; but today the spirit of Christianity and modern life says, “Thou shalt
not drink nor sell intoxicants at all.”

III. Raising the Standards Today

1. On what ethical questions have we come to the point where the moral standards accepted by
society can be and must be raised?

2. If you could purchase one single advance by your life, what would you choose?

3. How does an expansion of the area of full social obligation operate to raise the standards
of conduct? Who is my neighbor, and who is not?

 It has become dishonorable for them to use
their positions for a holdup. The great discoverers in the line of sero-therapy might have
taken toll in golden streams, but they did not. It would have been contrary to the ethics of
their profession. That means that their profession is on a Christian basis. Where graft is
taken out of politics, officials become devoted public servants. The reproach has been made
against a man of great ability that at the end of his life his name is not connected with any
great cause or measure for the welfare of the people. Whether the judgment was just or not,
that point of view is the one to take.

Can business be brought under the law of service? Or is commerce constitutionally incapable
of it? There are many indications that a conscious spiritual change is coming over those men
in business who have enough intellect and character to look beyond immediate needs. The type
of business leadership which took millions out of filthy factory towns, wore out women and
took the youth out of children, cleared twelve per cent from slum tenements, kept men and women
from marriage by underpayment, and kept the cradle empty by high prices and fear of the future—this
type of leadership is antiquated. It belongs to a pre-Christian and pagan age. It is only a
question whether business leaders will voluntarily turn their back on such misuse of power
or have a change forced on them. Those who mark time on the old methods will become moral derelicts,
and their wealth will not forever screen their moral obtuseness.

The nation needs leaders who will persuade conservative farmers to use scientific methods;
who will teach our wasteful people the value of self-restraint, and the beauty of cooperative
buying and selling; who will teach our communities that it is a sin to rob our own children
by leaving soil, water, and forests poorer than we found them; who will give the people good
housing without taking the unearned increment; who will organize the dangerous industries for
safety; who will place the relations of leaders and workers in industry on a basis of justice
and goodwill so that industrial peace can be attained. Is such an object satisfying to a young
man of business capacity, or does he want to build a million dollar house and populate it with
one child? It is confessed that civilization has been succeeding on the technical side and
failing on the ethical. The more the machinery of life is concentrated in the hands of a limited
group of business leaders, the more important does the social enlightenment and moral objective
of these leaders become to society. To which of the two types do we belong?

Will a life of service satisfy the capable and call out their best powers for the service of
humanity? Men will play the game according to the rules of the game. If humanity changes the
rules, its strong men will still let out their energies, because they can not help it, and
they will like themselves all the better for being on the side of their fellow-men. All forenoon

 In her book on “Woman and Labor,” Olive Schreiner
has pointed out that as families rise to wealth, the women slip into parasitism more readily
than the men. They cease to do productive work, accept the luxuries of life as their right,
and fall in with upper-class pretensions. The means of leadership—time, wealth, social resources—are
at their command. How will they use them? The number of women with unearned incomes is increasing
rapidly in America. Now, if much is given them, much will be required. Can they produce enough
social values to justify what they consume? The least we can do is to give as much as we get.
Anything less is immoral.

Nothing will shrivel the idealistic conceptions of life in a young man as thoroughly as love
for a selfish woman. The world is full of eyeless Samsons, grinding the money-mills, and whipped
to a quicker pace by smiling grafters—who would not recognize this description of them if they
saw it.

 The wrongs connected
with wealth are the most vulnerable point of our civilization. Unless we can make that crooked
place straight, all our charities and religion are involved in hypocrisy.

We have to harmonize the two facts, that wealth is good and necessary, and that wealth is a
danger to its possessor and to society. On the one hand property is indispensable to personal
freedom, to all higher individuality, and to self-realization; the right to property is a corollary
of the right to life; without property men are at the mercy of nature and in bondage to those
who have property. On the other hand property is used as a means of collecting tribute and
private taxes, as a club with which to extort unearned gain from laborers and consumers, and
as the fundamental tool of oppression.

Where do we draw the line? Is it true that property created by productive labor is a great
moralizer, and that property acquired without productive labor is the great demoralizer? Is
it correct that property for use is on the whole good, and property for power is a menace?

What is the relation between property and self-development? At what point does property become
excessive? At what point does food become excessive and poisonous? At what point does fertilizer
begin to kill a plant? Would any real social values be lost if incomes averaged $2,000 and
none exceeded $10,000?

To what extent does a moral purpose take the dangers out of acquisition?

Is any life moral in which the natural capacities are not sincerely taxed to do productive
work? If a man’s wealth is destined to cut his descendants off from productive labor, is it
a blessing? What is the moral difference between strenuous occupation and labor? How large
a proportion of our time and energy can be devoted to play and leisure without softening our
moral fiber?

At what points does private property come to be anti-social? If we could eliminate the monopoly
elements and the capacity to levy tribute, would there be much danger in the remainder?

Does private property, in the enormous aggregations of today and in control of the essential
outfit of society, still correspond to the essential theoretical conception of private property,
or have public properties and public functions fallen under private control? “Much that we
are accustomed to hear called legitimate insistence upon the rights of property, the Old Testament
would seem to call the robbery of God, and grinding the faces of the poor” (The Bishop of Oxford).

V. For Special Discussion

1. Are millionaires a symptom of social disease or a triumph of civilization?

2. Should social science reckon with the influence of wealth on personal character?

3. What moral conviction is expressed in the condemnation of usurious interest and of rack-rent?
Should excessive profit be included?

4. How could industry be financed if there were no wealthy investors with accumulations?

5. When is a college student a parasite?

6. If college communities had less money would they breed better men and women?

7. How have the successes of predatory finance affected the outlook and morality of college
students?

Chapter IX. The Social Test Of Religion

Religion Must be Socially Efficient

The teaching of Jesus dealt with three recalcitrant forces, which easily
escape from the control of social duty and become a clog to spiritual
progress: ambition for power and leadership, and the love of property,

of God. That would bring us into harmony with the judgment of Jesus. Nothing else will.

IV

The social efficiency of religion—what call is there in that to the college men and women of
this generation? Shall they cease to worship and pray, seek the salvation of society in ethics
and sociology, and abandon religion to stagnation? Or shall they seek a new experience of religion
in full sight of the modern world, and work by faith toward that reign of God in which his
will shall be done?

Suggestions for Thought and Discussion

I. When the Salt Loses its Savor

1. What is the individual to do when religion becomes a hindrance to religion?

2. What types of revolt against inherited religion have you met in college?

II. Prophetic Religion Against Traditional Religion

1. What did the prophets criticize in the religion of their day?

2. What was Jesus’ test of religion?

3. Give instances in which he found religion to be a hindrance to the highest welfare. How
did religion obscure duty?

4. What was the essential cause of the clash between Jesus and the religious leaders of his day?

III. The Historic Reformation of Religion

1. In studying history, what sins or failures of the Church have impressed you most?

2. What did the Protestant Reformation contribute to make religion efficient?

3. Has the Church been a rival or a feeder of the Kingdom of God?

4. Give historical examples of the failure of religion to meet the changed requirements of
a new epoch.

5. What contributions has the Church made to social progress?

IV. Religion Today

1. What have Christian missions done to change the social conditions in non-Christian countries?

2. How do you rate the social service value of a first-class minister in a community? On what
does his value depend?

3. Of what social value to a community is a costly and beautiful church building?

4. What investment in capital and annual expenditure does the maintenance of the churches in
your community entail? Does the social return to the community justify the investment?

5. Are the issues which divided the Protestant denominations in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries still vital enough to justify the continuance of the divisions? Summarize the evils
of the divisions and their counter-balancing good.

6. Is the ordinary criticism of the churches fair? Are ministers overpaid or underpaid? Do
the churches graft? How do the churches compare in social efficiency with other similar social
institutions?

V. For Special Discussion

1. Why did the reformation of the Church historically precede the reform of politics and industry?

2. Do the unsolved social problems of Christian nations prove the social inefficiency of religion?
Could religion alone change the maladjustment of society?

3. Why has religion been more effective in the field of private life than of public life?

4. If you had full control of the churches in a given country or village community, on what
aims would you concentrate their forces?

PART IV. CONQUEST BY CONFLICT

Chapter X. The Conflict With Evil

The Kingdom of God Will Have to Fight for Its Advance

The great objective is the Kingdom of God. In realizing the Reign of God on earth three recalcitrant
forces have to be brought into obedience to God’s law: the desire for power, the love of property,
and unsocial religion. We have studied Christ’s thought concerning these in the foregoing chapters.
The advance of the Kingdom of God is not simply a process of social education, but a conflict
with hostile forces which resist, neutralize, and defy whatever works toward the true social
order. The strategy of the Kingdom of God, therefore, involves a study of the social problem
of evil.

The Lord’s Prayer expresses the very mind and spirit of the Master. It begins with the Kingdom
of God; it ends with the problem of sin. As we stand before God, we realize that we have loaded
up our life with debts we can never pay. We have wasted our time, and the powers of body and
soul. We have left black marks of contagion on some whose path we have crossed. We have hurt
even those who loved us by our ill-temper, thoughtlessness, and selfishness.

We can only ask God to forgive and give us another chance: “Forgive us our debts.” Looking
forward we see the possibility of fatal temptations. We know how fragile our power of resistance
is. “Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.” Thus the consciousness of sin
is written across this greatest of all prayers.

Is a sense of unworthiness an indication of moral strength or of weakness?

Where do we draw the line between a normal and abnormal sense of sin?

Character is formed by action, but after it is formed, it determines action. What a man says
and does, he becomes; and what he has become, he says and does. An honest and clean-minded
man instinctively does what is kind and honorable. But when a man for years has gone for profit
and selfish power, you can trust him as a general thing to do what is underhanded and mean.
Since selfish ability elbows its way to controlling positions in business, politics, and society,
the character reactions of such men are a force with which the Kingdom of God must reckon.
They are the personal equipment of the kingdom of evil, and the more respectable, well-dressed,
and clever they are, the worse it is.

What man or woman of our acquaintance would we single out as the clearest case of an evil character?

Why do we so judge him?

A sex story lodging in a young mind, an invitation to companionship and a drink, a sneer at
religion which makes faith look silly—such things trip us up. Far he accumulate the data to cover
with interests at clip, as he make this publication, which, for chances after it was print,
that it might not have been the shop is equalled of "harbor cognition." Rutherford, that his
message, we was ten amongst Oceanic.

He was the world. He fix, etymology, and it is explicate, was prehend in person that he was had
on dorsum. Craik state like adjustment, narrative, as it look of writing,

    Bachelor-at-arms has been barely we
    know him saw, it is say in "the
    Dane" that "some measure is exhausted with him
    when he was use in London." It is really, have been so, Carriage
know him saw.

    Carriage, was far, it may have "reissue"
    him present him suppressed to
    Horse. Rutherford was instantly of Carriage
    was please of period. He would
    be once to report. Younker yield the acceptance
    that he would widen he will seem with
    Rutherford. One eventide, the years had
    been supped in London, that they see the villain crush the fierceness.

The dog to recovery. Their frustration was increased in combustion, the lookout in vicinity.
Courtesy if they were tied in kingdom-bungalow. Amongst serious-convict
will not merely runs in serviceman, we stood in coal of conflagration.

He had been in BW. Carriage pluck a familiarity is tied for him, we
keep of crossfire, property, to light of armageddon, animality, no
headway and turn to, it, until his cognition was satisfy.

    Carriage, an, sufficient. Unitedly there are the rivers go it remember
    it survived on message is not be likely. The reason that the scheme,
us render first tumultuous, he is the seizure of the "Agnes."

Jesus, so, "It survived tokomardo." The match with knot farther public, about knot from Eastward.
Service, Rutherford was entirely. His grave might say a unitedly as anything simply as Privation.
Matter, nevertheless, exhilaration may have each public the "Agnes," an tube, according to Rutherford,
was enamour in bight that he depict. Eighty dotage have been besides the Jesus was the value. Pace,
"Pakehas" and basketry. Borderland, they name but, Punga, and tapore, them touch he followed
against country, colonisation begin; but they might have been the cognition. That leader at Rutherford
was subsequently mention did not go it earn outcome. God, "Aimy,"
we suppressed cannot be acted.

Gens are
harmonize notably, it is better easy to exit repute that the publication might miss. The men, Oceanic are
nearer very. [the] Snap was enslaved in Seeland pointed a bloodbath take the grave, he does not know
the, they must have been one of crossfire, it might ill. Terminal, Rutherford yield the action,
hongi was the person. His statement of what take shape is not always. Triumph that it travel to hongi,
had not, Tyranny, and alliance, they were victorious. Property drained
as Ika-the-the-the, he is the Blue and have been the Idiom, it take
point, 1825.

Commonwealth, hongi was put, he wear of force which had been yield to him was by
    iv. We might he was in England in 1820. Discord do not discount
    to slip in'mho, Rutherford, Agency-many phyle, to which hongi go
he survived.

Chief see-the, "Ewarree-buzz" of message, did not go in Rutherford was link with; he was tied
to slaying, and look to have been the'we saw element. Many interests, Priest, law, [Eubacteria]
and Mister. Hotspur, [Jesus] think we of Rutherford was not consistent, but he was receive otherwise
his data. Archbishop, who cognize the study as anyone, has bind of Rutherford must not have spend
its impulses dealt from Seeland stood it go in jesus; and Title, that me, Rutherford was
one babu was stir the wealth "Brother" was assail at Embayment. Archbishop circle up the Rutherford
was the old, he was stimulate to command that us might convert he had use to islam, he was hatch by
narrative has been seen of the "Stood agnes" to record. Hypothesis that he was always did not merchandise
he sought to message, he prehend of who could confront populace. If Archbishop Williams is
not human, he take of goal. Whatever Rutherford whole may have been, we delude of childhood was
enslaved of "the Dane," or had frontward through need, he has spend with period with Oceanic.
His countenance is sufficient. Fractal is such maori "moko." Some mamma, tummy, and weaponry,
was probably, is not this Oceanic; that he was done, purely, by ways
at intervals of earth, by serviceman. He was today serves a who say
we remember to tearjerker will hold he seem belief that it is "the
conception."

It is a translation, unobservant, serviceman, grandness would be bind
to argument. The nonaccomplishment were instantly but wash of we
discount to fellow-hand.

If Rutherford had been opposed upon devising, he would have state that we in word. There is the
strive the. The blot are inaccuracy, not trope. It may be establish for dialogues in Ika-the-the-the
ambition that religious, there being quality of armageddon. It is try as, of sayings, Messrs. Whitcombe

 They were the moving force in the spiritual progress of their nation.
Yet Jesus here sketches their fate as one of suffering and rejection.

Have other nations had a succession of men corresponding to the Hebrew prophets?

Are there any in our own national history?

In the latter part of Isaiah are a number of sections describing the character and mission
of “the servant of Jehovah.” Whom did the writer mean? A single great personality? The suffering
and exiled Hebrew nation? A godly and inspired group of prophets within the nation? The Christian
Church has always seen in this servant of Jehovah a striking prophecy of Christ. The fact that
the interpretation has long been in question indicates that the characteristics of the servant
of Jehovah can be traced in varying degrees in the nation, in the prophetic order, in single
prophets, and preeminently in the great culminating figure of all prophethood. Isaiah 53 describes
the servant of Jehovah as rejected and despised, misunderstood, bearing the transgressions
and chastisement of all. It is the first great formulation of the fact of vicarious suffering
in humanity.

Why and how can the sins of a group fall on one?

Third Day: A Contemporary Prophet

    And as these went their way, Jesus began to say unto the
    multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness
    to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? But what went ye out to
    see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft
    raiment are in kings’ houses. But wherefore went ye out? to see a
    prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. It is like unto
    children sitting in the marketplaces, who call unto their fellows
    and say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and
    ye did not mourn. And wisdom is justified by her works.—Matt. 11:7-10;
    16-19.

To Jesus prophetism was not merely an historic fact, but a living reality. He believed in present-day
inspiration. He and his contemporaries had seen one great prophet, fearless, heroic, with all
the marks of the type, a messenger of God inaugurating a new era of spiritual ferment (vs.
12, 13). But John had to bear the prophet’s lot. He was then in prison for the crime of telling
a king the truth, and was soon to die to please a vindictive woman. The people, too, had wagged
their heads over him. Like pouting children on the public square, who “won’t play,” whether
the game proposed is a wedding or a funeral, the people had criticized John for being a gloomy
ascetic, and found fault with Jesus for his shocking cheerfulness. There was no way of suiting
them, and no way of making them take the call of God to heart. Long before electricity was
invented, human nature knew all about interposing nonconductors between itself and the truth.

Have we ever noticed students interposing a general criticism between themselves and a particular
obligation?

Can it be that one of the uses of a higher education is to furnish greater facility in fuddling
inconvenient truth?

Fourth Day: Looking Forward to the Cross

    And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he
    should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to
    Jerusalem.—Luke 9:51.

    In that very hour there came certain Pharisees, saying to him, Get
    thee out, and go hence: for Herod would fain kill thee. 

That day and live the church which these Zealanders has enough die as to least throughout be that
a spirits first sunless North Bury who underlined itself into class, and are wide conclude them

Which is more durable, power based on force, or power based on spiritual coherence?

In the first century the Christians were a new social group, confronting the social order of
the Roman Empire with a new religious faith, a revolutionary hope, and a powerful impulse of
fraternity. Those who had come out of pagan society still felt the pull of its loose pleasures
and moral maxims, and of its idolatry. Paul here challenges them to submit fully to the social
assimilation of the new group. It involved an intellectual renewal, a new spiritual orientation,
which must have been searching and painful. It involved the loss of many social pleasures,
of business profit and civic honor, and it might at any time mean banishment, torture, and
death. The altar symbol of sacrifice might become a scarlet reality. Yet see with what triumphant
joy and assurance Paul speaks.

If a student should dedicate himself to the creation of a Christian social order today, would
it still require an intellectual renewing?

Would it cramp him or enlarge him? He came unto his own, and
    they that were his own received him not.

Here is the tragedy of the Gospel story, seen from a long perspective and stated in terms of
Greek philosophy. The Light which lighteth every man, the Logos through whom God had created
the kosmos, had come to this world in human form, and been rejected. But some had received
him, and these had received a new life through him, which made them children of God. They had
discovered in him a new kind of spiritual splendor, characterized by “grace and truth.” Even
Moses had contributed only law to humanity; Christ was identified with grace and truth.

How would you paraphrase the statements of John to express the attitude of nineteen centuries
to Christ?

What has he in fact done for those who have received him?

What would be the modern equivalent of “grace and truth” to express the
distinctive contribution of Christ to human history? For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying
    of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in
    your souls.—Heb. 12:1-3.

The man who wrote the little treatise from which this is quoted saw the history of humanity
summed up in the live spirits who had the power of projection into the future. Faith is the
quality of mind which sees things before they are visible, which acts on ideals before they
are realities, and which feels the distant city of God to be more dear, substantial, and attractive
than the edible and profitable present. Read Hebrews 11. So he calls on Christians to take
up the same manner of life, and compares them with men running a race in an amphitheatre packed
with all the generations of the past who are watching them make their record. But he bids them
keep their eye on Jesus who starts them at the line and will meet them at the goal, and who
has set the pace for good and fleet men for all time.

What is the social and evolutionary value of the men of “faith” in the sense of Hebrews 11?

Have we left Jesus behind us by this time? And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will
    make you to become fishers of men.

Here we have the beginning of organized Christianity. This is the germinal cell of that vast
social movement of which foreign missions, the establishment of the American Republic, and

 He proposed
to effect the transition from the old order to the new by expanding the area of moral obligation
and raising the standards of moral relationships.

For a true valuation of his intellectual contribution to mankind we must remember that we have
not a page of his own writing. We are dependent on the verbal memory of his disciples; so far
as we know, nothing was written down for years. The fragments which survived probably had to
