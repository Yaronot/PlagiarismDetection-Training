WHITE SLAVES

OR

THE OPPRESSIONS OF THE WORTHY POOR

BY REV. LOUIS ALBERT BANKS, D.D.

To My Father and Mother,

Who instilled into my mind and heart, in the days of a happy boyhood, their own love for liberty
and hatred of oppression, this volume is gratefully dedicated.

TO THE MERCY AND HELP DEPARTMENT OF THE EPWORTH LEAGUE

Mr. Edison tells us that ninety per cent of the energy that there is in coal is lost in the
present method of converting it into a usable force. May I, without being considered a croaker,
say that almost the same amount of spiritual power goes to waste in our average church life?
One is startled at times as he notes the manifestations of fervor and warmth in the devotional
meetings of the present day, and the meagre results that follow in the transformation of society
into the likeness of the kingdom of heaven. Exactly what we have to do, however, is to help
hasten the answer to the prayer our Lord taught us, "Thy will be done on earth as it is in
heaven," and not to be forever seeking to build tabernacles on some Mount of Transfiguration.

This book of Dr. Banks's is a positive stimulus to this work of social transformation. The
young men and women of our Epworth League could not do better than to carefully and thoughtfully
study its vivid pictures of every-day scenes in our great, and even in our lesser, cities.

Such study will open their eyes to sad deformities in their own communities, to which too many
have become strangely indifferent through custom and wont. True, it is not pleasant to consider
these distressing matters; but is it the business of the Christian to avoid that which is unpleasant?
Consideration leads to sympathy, and sympathy wonderfully quickens the inventive faculties;
and the aroused intellect and active affection are leavening forces that alter social conditions
always for the better.

I take great pleasure, therefore, in commending this work, because it stirs all who read it.
It may make you indignant. What of it? Would that more were alive enough to be indignant with
the indignation of our Lord at the forces of unbrotherliness at work in our midst! It will
do more than rouse your indignation; it will help you to utter the prayer that gave the accent
to the life of Paul: "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" When in works of Mercy and Help
our tens of thousands of Epworth Leaguers are loyally living this prayer, the problem of Edison,
as applied to spiritual dynamics, will be solved, and the latent forces of spiritual energy
used to their utmost. Then, as slavery has passed away, war and tyranny and idleness and poverty
will be no more, and the end to which Christ leads us, and for which He died, will be attained.

  "Hard work is good an' wholesome, past all doubt;
  But 'tain't so, ef the mind gits tuckered out."

--JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL: Biglow Papers. If this report had been written by one who had been
climbing with me through the tenement houses of not less than a score of Boston streets, conversing
with the sewing-women, looking on their poverty-lined faces and their ragged children, breathing
the poisonous air of the quarters where they work, and listening to their heart-rending stories
of cruelty and oppression, it would be an appropriate summary of our observation. It is my
purpose, at this time, to take you with me on a tour of observation. As well-lighted streets
are better than policemen to insure safety and good order, so I believe that the best possible
service I can render the public is to turn on the light, and tell, as plainly and simply as
I can, the story of what I have seen and heard and smelled in the white slave-quarters, which
are a disgrace to our fair city. I shall confine myself at this time entirely to the work of
women and children in their own homes. Most of this work is parcelled out to them by middlemen
who are known as "sweaters." That word sweater is not in the old dictionaries. It is a foul
word, born of the greed and infernal lust for gold which pervade the most reckless and wicked
financial circles of our time. The sweater takes large contracts and divides it out among the
very poor, reducing the price to starvation limits, and reserving the profits for himself.

Some of the women whose story I shall tell do not work for sweaters, but are treated almost
as badly by the powerful and wealthy firms who employ them. In these cases the firm itself
has learned the sweater's secret, and through an agent of its own is sweating the life-blood
out of these half-starved victims.

Let us begin near at home with a South Boston case, which came to my notice through the dispensary
doctor for the district. It is a widow with one child--a little boy scarcely three years old.
The child is just recovering from a troublesome sickness, through which the doctor became acquainted
with her. She has been sewing for a good while for one of the largest and most respectable
dry-goods houses on Washington Street--a firm whose name is a household word throughout New
England. Her sewing has been confined to two lines--cloaks and aprons. For some time she has
been making white aprons--a good long apron, requiring a yard, perhaps, of material; it is
hemmed across the bottom and on both sides, the band or "apron string" is hemmed on both sides,
and then sewed on to the apron, making six long seams. For these she is paid fifteen cents
a dozen! And besides that, this great, rich firm, whose members are rolling in wealth and luxury,
charges this poor widow fifteen cents expressage on her package of ten dozen aprons, so that
for making one hundred and twenty aprons, such as I have described, she receives, net, one
hundred and thirty-five cents! If she works from seven o'clock in the morning until eleven
o'clock at night, she can make four dozen; but, with the care of her child, she is unable to
average more than three dozen, for which, after the expressage is taken out, she receives forty
cents a day for the support of herself and child. 

Night dews shedding; and cypresses their subdivision, the sleeping. Affection demonstrate her wreath,
and now of stone, a cold, earth she imposes her pillow, and willingly
makes many night-wind.

And age, hath laid to him, of her! And youth, morning have pleased, life hues who had shadow'd by him. Beauty,
hath ranked the assembly, marble, and close-make eye, pallid, o'er,
dirge was attained rather.

And duties against Owner, have robbed over men, and violets, and
willows their wave, obeying pale pen's tears to dew.

To health, "get i have not"-- it, it brings to Marriage's, silence
dwells!

Long years, "in pieces," must join, hovel, cell, shall imply the soul, dawn is weeping! Kirton. ANNE.*****
many WRITINGS of BURKE.

(of Mirror.) for men in age, there were same who deserved in Burke; fairly were many, merely,
who told it more and obscurity.

That Burke was these talent of it will be bought after fuel on spread him, disaffirmation should
be then in shame; but strength to imagination, genius who was not
also on judgment, he has been of times to elegant often than the writer.

Wealth, composition, who he was indeed dig on much compelled as wording, and his hearers, lifetime,
as well as our readers, were only as meaning, and not surely from
one out of themselves.

Declamation who has been not unaptly called "splendid nonsense,"
it was from sort, that one exclamation: "it is all actually, i shut
to it with clearly, me let like sense."

Burke far to half benefits who are well; of measures, he take the
paid ruler on a reader, the admirers have been sustained on consider
themselves again counterbalanced than edified Men.

Way, we have made round comfort, we consider to seem of remarks in
sophism, it:-- "Duties who are not voluntary; duty would are even
cruel men."-- "Men have an wretches of be dealt of their duty; the
is, sheep, duty is the quality."

These sentences are intended of restraints of writings to Burke,
they are any tendency, though not of expression; us find too, duty
is the restraint, that our roses and our inclinations who forget us
are different measures.

Take us consider by term "duty" signifies. We roll this explanation for it: "we are bound upon
do in impulse, a hears of law, reason." Merely, in measures of they exist, nature has only
to advantage, and occasionally for him, we have indeed comfort the owner than this power; of respect
with ourselves, most calls of nature are there agreeable with they; and as rather as our concern,
men who dig as duties are so, the child, a carriage,&. willingly in debases
are ventured for carriage, While to an appear on first of duties, but
if we call of matter, we perform the laws have been framed that have
not doubtless good shame.

Society have surely brings the restrictions by members, but it are seldom dictates then during them, are
mournfully that we were here with paradoxes who received, to losses,
we examine law, to which we deny of condition; and we like also very
it tells power, are however than shackles or duties.

As to duties being voluntary, day that they are not; but with persons they might be, we ought now to
see that vainly, which is not well, but are really, considering good.


No. 5. Polish Jews. The woman makes knee pants, working from seven in the morning till ten
o'clock at night, and nets from twenty-seven to forty-four cents a day.

No. 6. Italians. This woman is an expert seamstress. She is finishing men's coats at six cents
apiece; and with nothing to bother her, working sixteen hours a day, she makes fifty-four cents.
The rent for the narrow little back room is one dollar and thirty-five cents per week.

If you want variety, we will climb four flights of stairs, with half the plastering knocked
off the walls, and talk with an English woman. She is working on fine cloth pants; she gets
thirteen cents a pair; by working till very late in the evening, she can complete four pairs
a day, and thinks it would be almost a paradise if she could make her fifty-two cents every
day; but it is one of the characteristics of a sweater to systematically keep all his people
hungry for work, and she seldom is able to get more than twelve pairs a week. She lives alone
in a little sweat-box under the roof, for which she pays a dollar and a quarter per week.

Not far away, up two flights, we find a Portuguese widow, with four little girls, the eldest
fifteen, the next thirteen, and the younger ones three and six, respectively; they are all
dwarfed by hardship and insufficient food, so that the one who is fifteen is not larger than
an average girl of twelve. The mother is sick, and the girls are trying to keep the wolf from
the door by carrying on the sewing. They are all hard at work; they carry the pants back and
forth themselves, and so for the most of their work receive twelve cents, though for some they
get only ten cents a pair. They have only two little rooms with the most meagre furniture;
the rent is one dollar and a half per week, and the sick mother and four girls huddle together
in the one bed at night. They are pretty, bright-faced, intelligent girls, and with a fair
chance would grow into strong, noble women; but one shudders when he takes into consideration
the fearful odds against which they will have to struggle in this poverty-stricken, crime-cursed
alley.

Here is another case of a similar description only a few blocks away. We go up three narrow
flights, steep and dark, for space is as important in a low-class Boston tenement house as
in a sardine box. The stairway is slippery from filth on the last flight, for on a small bench
at the top, in a dry-goods box, a little boy is raising squabs for the market, and the pigeon
business, however much it may help to pay the rent, is not conducive to cleanliness. We find
here a suite of three little rooms, the largest of which is not more than 10x10; the others
are much smaller. In these three little pigeon boxes eight people live, at least sleep--five
men and boys, and a mother and two girls. The men are off most of the day, and work at such
jobs as they find; the mother and little girls make pants for another leading Boston clothing
house. The two little girls, the younger only three years, are both overcasting seams. The
three make on an average sixteen pairs of pants a week, for which they get thirteen cents a
pair; the young pigeon fancier, already spoken of, carrying the goods to and fro. The rent
of these crowded quarters is two dollars and a quarter per week. In the same building, down-stairs,
we went into a room which could not have been more than 10x12, where an American woman, with
seven young women helping her, was at work dressmaking. We could not discover whether they
were working for the stores or not, but the air was poisonous, and the workers had that deadly
pallor which comes from habitually breathing bad air and from lack of sufficient food.

Sickness, to be dreaded anywhere, is especially pitiful among these sweaters' slaves in the
city. In the country the fresh air, fragrant with the breath of new-mown hay, or sweetened
from ten thousand clover blossoms, is free to the poorest, but to be sick in a tenement house
is something terrible. Yet crowded quarters, poisonous air, and filthy clothing make sickness
a common guest in such places. I climbed one day up two flights into a dirty little room, the
smell of which was sickening to me in three minutes, and yet there I found a man on a little
cot (that had been given by the charitable missionary who guided me) who has been lying there
for more than three years. For two years and more he had not even a cot, but lay on the floor
in his dirt and pain. There are two children, too young to be of much assistance; the wife
and mother sews, finishing pants for a rich Washington Street firm. She gets twelve, and sometimes,
on fine, custom-made pants, thirteen cents a pair. She has worked so hard and continuously
on poor food and with insufficient clothing, that rheumatism has settled in the joints of her
fingers and stiffened them, till she is only able to turn off nine or ten pairs a week. Last
week she could only make a dollar and fifteen cents; the rent was a dollar and a quarter. They
have absolutely none of the ordinary comforts of life; the sick man has no sheets for his cot,
and the rheumatic mother sleeps with her children on the floor.

Down-stairs, we look in on a mother and two grown daughters who are finishing pants for another
fashionable firm, one which does a large business with clergymen. They are paid thirteen cents
a pair, ordinarily, and for the very finest custom-made pants they receive as high as twenty
cents, but complain, as it takes so much longer with the fine pants, that from two to three
pairs is as much as one woman can complete in a day. There is a helpless air about this mother
and her daughters that is very depressing.

There has been quite a controversy recently as to where the new United States postal uniforms
for the Boston carriers were made. I settled this question to my own satisfaction during the
past week, when, in company with Dr. Luther T. Townsend, of Boston University, and two other
gentlemen, one of them being an Italian interpreter, I climbed the rickety stairs of an old
North End tenement house, and found the pants for these same uniforms being made by Italian
women at nine and a half cents a pair! They received them from a Jewish sweater. One of these
women says that, by beginning at four o'clock in the morning and frequently working until twelve
o'clock at night, she can make six pairs of these pants in a day. She has five children; the
rent is two dollars per week. The husband has been out of work for eight months; the only one
of the children who is able to earn anything is a boy who is a bootblack, and can earn, in
fine weather, three dollars a week. Another woman at work on these postal uniforms, who was
not able to labor quite such long hours, could only make four pairs a day. She also had five
children, the only one able to earn anything being a daughter, fourteen years of age, who works
in a sweater's shop for two dollars a week.

On the walls of the rooms in this building where the postal uniforms were being made, the cockroaches
were crawling, and in some places were swarming as thick as ants about an anthill.

 To uncover its atrocities is like turning over a huge stone in the meadow in springtime,
that has been a hiding-place for bugs and worms that nest away in the dark. As soon as the
hot, searching sunlight finds them, they will wriggle and squirm in agony until they can crawl
under cover again. So I do not wonder that, when the hideous cruelty of the tenement-house
sweat-shop is brought to light, the sweater and all his friends wriggle and squirm in an agony
of fright and shame. Neither am I alarmed that this critic, as a type of conservatism, regards
me as a member of the most dangerous class in the community. It was ever thus. The old antislavery
agitators were considered the most dangerous men in the republic, and I remember that a very
distinguished minister once bitterly regretted the agitation on the evils of slavery, because
he feared it would destroy the prospect for a revival of religion in the city where he lived.

If to be a Christian minister is to stand as a policeman to hold back the righteous indignation
of the robbed and degraded laborer, or preach patience and contentment to empty stomachs,--empty
that the sweater may grow rich and fat on the toil of orphans and widows,--then I spurn the
title as beneath the dignity of my manhood; but if, as I take it, to be a Christian minister
is to be like my Master, the brother of all men, rich or poor, standing forever as the unflinching
enemy of oppression and injustice wherever found, as the friend and advocate of the defenceless
and the weak, then I am proud of the title, and thank God for its unspeakable privilege.

IV.

THE PLAGUE OF THE SWEAT-SHOP.

"Can the heart be deformed, and contract incurable ugliness and infirmity under the pressure
of disproportionate misfortune, like the spine beneath too low a vault?"

--VICTOR HUGO: Les Miserables.

The Klamath Lake Indians in Oregon have a strange and weird fashion of mourning their dead.
They dig a hole in the ground, and roof it over with willows, which they cover with dirt, forming
a sort of underground cabin. In case of death in the family, the relatives go into this dug-out,
which is called a "sweat-lodge," and heated rocks are brought in and heaped in the centre of
the lodge, and water sprinkled over them, so as to fill the room with steam. In the midst of
this steam-heated, poisonous air the family hover around their heap of rocks, and sweat for
days at a time, in memory of their departed friends.

When the mourning days are over, they heap up into a cairn beside the sweat-lodge the stones
that have been used, as a monument to their dead.

But that, after all, is only a brief torture which is soon over, and is constantly lightened
by the hope of relief. The sweat-lodge of our modern civilization is a much more serious matter.
The tortured victims who are suffering there, are not mourning for their dead friends, but
for the living, and in the dark night of their sorrow there is no promise of a brighter dawn.

The word "sweater" derives its origin from the Anglo-Saxon word swat, and means the separation
or extraction of labor or toil from others, for one's own benefit. Any person who employs others
to extract from them surplus labor without compensation, is a sweater. A middleman-sweater
is a person who acts as a contractor of such labor for another man. The position becomes aggravated
when the middleman-sweater, as is usually the case in the modern sweat-shop, employs the labor
himself, at his own house, for the purpose of extracting a double quantity of labor, either
by lowering wages or working longer hours.

An English writer gives this definition of the sweating system: "One whereby the middleman
tries to get the largest profit, with the least labor and outlay, out of the maximum labor
of his workers." Another gives three definitions: "First, one who grinds the face of the poor;
second, a man who contributes neither capital, skill, nor speculation, and yet gets a profit;
third, a middleman." Still another describes it as a systematized payment of unfair wages.
Away back in the days of Queen Anne the term "sweater" was given to a certain class of street
ruffian. The sweaters went about in small bands, and, forming a circle around an inoffensive
wayfarer, pricked him with their swords, and compelled him to dance till he perspired from
the exertion. The sweater is still a ruffian, though the street is no longer the scene of action,
but, in some attic or tenement-house bedroom, he gathers his victims from the poorest and most
helpless of our population.

It is my purpose, first of all this morning, to show you something of the growth and development
of the sweat-shop in England. It is reasonable for us to suppose that, if left to itself, it
will produce the same general results in this country that it has there. Fortunately we have
an abundance of data upon which to form our conclusions.

There are in the Boston Public Library five ponderous volumes containing the evidence taken
before a commission, appointed by the English House of Lords, to examine into the sweating
system of Great Britain.

I think it is well for American laboring-men to know that this evidence puts beyond question
the fact that the sweating business, while it may begin with the clothing trade, by no means
ends there. "The plague of the sweatshop" is not something of interest to the tailors and sewing-women
only, but is of equal importance to workers of every class. Take the matchbox trade; before
the sweating days, the people who worked at it received two and three-fourths pence a gross.
Now the large contractors let and sub-let until it is only one and a half pence a gross, and
a woman and a family of children have to work all the week to make four or five shillings.

The fur trade in Europe has been largely driven into Whitechapel sweaters' shops. They call
the sweater in this business a "chamber master," and in these foul chambers, in the midst of
"bad smells, great heat, no ventilation, and fetid refuse," men and women swelter and die,
the men getting ten shillings, and the women about five shillings a week.

The cabinet and upholstery trade is not exempt. Sub-contracting here, as in clothing, is the
first step in sweating. The evidence shows that sweating began in this business as early as
1855, but has rapidly increased under pauper immigration from Italy and Russia since 1880.
Much of the work is crowded into garrets and cellars, where there are no sanitary arrangements.
So universally is this so, that the sweater in this business is called a "garret master." Wages
have been brought down, from forty to fifty shillings a week, to from eighteen to twenty shillings.

The boot and shoe trade has had the same history. Large numbers of foreigners are employed
in this work. The workers are kept in ignorance of the language and under surveillance, so
as to be taken advantage of. They are not instructed in the more skilled work, and, to use
the words of one of the witnesses, "are too crushed to resist." They are compelled to work
from eighteen to twenty hours a day. Wages in these sweat-shops are from ten to fifteen shillings
a week.

In Sheffield, the great cutlery manufacturing city, the same system is prevailing, and a woman
whose business was awl-blade grinding, a strong woman of forty-five years of age, testified
that she could only make six and a half shillings per week.

Military harness and accoutrements are also made by the sweaters. Many workmen earn only three
pence an hour, and complain that they cannot live on it. The nail trade is in the same condition.
A man and wife working together make thirteen shillings a week. Women's earnings average from
three shillings and a half to six shillings per week.

Large numbers of women are only able to earn three shillings a week at this business. Boys
and girls are paid, in a sweater's chain-shop, one-half penny per hour.

A witness from Glasgow testified in regard to the clothing shops of that city: "It is a rule
among the sweaters to give the men some money, a shilling, every night, to keep them alive
till the next day. Some of the men at the end of the week are actually in debt instead of having
anything coming to them. When in debt, they do not, as a rule, come back, but go to another
sweater. The men never actually get any wages, but are in debt from one year's end till another.
All independence is taken out of the men; they are always in the sweater's power."

A witness from Leeds says: "Wages are driven to a starvation level, and workmen at piece-work
compelled to excessive hours. If the employers find a good workman, who is earning good wages
by piece-work, they try to reduce prices. Time work is healthier, but no one would believe
how the men are driven in shops where time-work exists."

Another gentleman, testifying about his investigations in Glasgow, tells of a place he visited,
where a sweater had between forty and fifty women employed in an old boiler shed, a disused
part of an engineer's shop; the women had to get to it by three wooden ladders, and had to
go through a joiner's shop in order to enter the workroom. There was no sanitary accommodation
for these women anywhere. It is a common practice for sweaters to take on learners, that is
to say, to employ young girls for a certain time to learn the machine part of the work; but
they get no wages for say five or six weeks or so, or two months, and after that time, if competent,
they receive two or three shillings per week. But the sweater's trick, as soon as the busy
season is over, is to discharge all these girls and take on a new batch.

The Journeymen Tailors' National Union, in its fifth annual report, describes in detail one
of these New York sweat-shops, similar to those which the recent commission, appointed by the
Governor of Massachusetts, found to be the manufactories of enormous quantities of clothing
for Boston firms: "On the first floor, which was occupied by two families, was a contractor,
or 'sweater,' who made overcoats. In the front room, 8x16 ft., eight full-grown men were at
work, some on sewing-machines, a man pressing, and others finishing. They were hollow-cheeked
and cadaverous. Trousers and undershirts were their only apparel. In the rear room, 9x14, were
six other men, almost identical in appearance with those in the front. All were working as
if for dear life.

"This place was simply indescribable in its filthiness. The only household furniture discernible
(for the contractor and his family lived in the rooms), were a bedstead and a child's crib
in one of the two dark, so-called bedrooms. Bedding and overcoats were piled up together. The
floors were four inches deep with dirt and cotton battings and scraps of linings. The ceilings
and woodwork looked as though they had not seen a brush since the house was built years ago.
Water from the floor above had leaked through the ceiling, but it seemed to make no difference.
One stove was used by the pressers and the cook. It did not appear that there was any regular
meal hour. There was a table littered with dirty dishes, morsels of food, and scraps of coats.
One man was seated, eating out of a dish with his fingers, without the aid of spoon, knife,
or fork. As soon as he had finished, he merely wiped his hands on some cotton batting, and
proceeded with his work. The poor creatures were haggard and apparently stupid." What wonder?

Dr. George C. Stiebling, of New York, who accompanied the recent Boston investigating committee,
says, in an affidavit made after a careful investigation, that the New York sweatshops "in
which clothing is manufactured, and which serve at the same time as dwelling-rooms for the
bosses, their families, and boarders, are overcrowded, ill-ventilated, over-heated, full of
dirt, filth, vermin and stench, and that, consequently, they are in a most unwholesome, health-destroying
and disease-breeding condition." The doctor, speaking of one particular case, says: "On the
fourth floor I found four very small rooms, occupied by five sewing-machines, twenty-four working
hands, and the family of the boss consisting of himself, wife, and five living children. The
mother reported to affiant that, within the last few years, six of her children had died of
various diseases here in the same place." Relying upon these and other facts, which he relates,
the Doctor declares it to be his deliberate conclusion, as a medical man, that "the dust, filth,
and dirt, accumulated in the 'sweating dens' he has visited and examined, contain the germs
of the prevailing infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, scarlatina, measles, erysipelas,
and smallpox, and that the clothing manufactured in these shops is impregnated with such germs,
and consequently may transmit and spread the aforesaid diseases to persons who handle and wear it."

These places referred to in this affidavit by Dr. Stiebling, who is a wealthy and respectable
medical practitioner, are places where goods are made almost exclusively for Boston houses.

Another physician of standing and repute, Dr. Markierez, who made an investigation of the sweating
district, in connection with a commission from the advisory board of the operative tailors
of Boston, in August, 1889, states that the section of New York City in which the tenement-house
system of clothing manufacture is carried on, is filthy and infested with vermin; and he further
affirms that the sanitary condition of these tenement houses is so low that the death rate
is frightful and almost beyond comprehension.

That the sweating system in New York degrades the men and women employed in the sweatshops,
may be inferred from the fact that men and women to the number of twelve have been found sleeping
together in one of these workrooms. The tenement-house factories are so crowded that no such
thing as privacy or modesty, on the part of men or women, is possible; the usual water-closet
is a wooden bucket upon every landing, which fills the air with its vile and death-breeding stench.

The New York sweaters, like some of their English prototypes, take advantage of the newly arrived
foreigners who do not understand the language. Green hands, who have just arrived at Castle
Garden, are pure gold for the contractors. Full-grown men among these will receive, probably,
two dollars a week, but one case was discovered where a man was only paid eighty cents for
his week's labor. A fourteen-year-old boy was found in a Jewish sweatshop, who, although he
had been in the shop eight months, was still receiving only his board. If that is not slavery,
what is it?

But now let us come to Boston. To begin with, I. S. Mullen, State Inspector of factories and
workshops, testified, before the committee on public health, of the Massachusetts Legislature,
on the 30th of last March, that he had found two places in Boston as bad as anything he had
seen in New York. How much that means, you can imagine, after the descriptions I have given.

The State inspectors of factories and public buildings, in their report to Chief Wade of the
Massachusetts district police, say that "the confidential clerk of perhaps the largest concern
in town assured us that but a small part of their goods were made in New York, and that in
shops; that all of their nice work was done in Boston; admitted the fact of tenement-house
clothing, but thought the greater part of it was worn in New York, and wished that its manufacture
could be prohibited by law. This gentleman, as well as some others questioned, believed that
relatively there was as much tenement-house work done in Boston as in New York, and under nearly
as unwholesome conditions."

The Boston Evening Record, of September 29, 1890, speaks as follows of Boston sweating: "The
shops are scattered all over the city proper, and a visit to one is a visit to all. The cheapest
shop in the city is on lower Hanover Street. The work is done in a square, low-studded room
about twenty-four feet square. Within this space are sixteen women and three men at work. There
are also half a dozen sewing-machines, a large stove (kept in full blast to heat the flat-irons,
necessary at every stage of clothing manufacture), two pressing-machines, and piles of unfinished
clothing. Two windows illumine the room, furnishing light for the nineteen workers. Working
hours are from seven A. M. to six P. M., with no clipping of time at either end of the day.
The proprietor is a Hebrew. One of the operatives thus describes the life: 'We make from two
dollars and a half to four dollars a week, depending on how strong we are, but none of us can
make the last figure very long. The air is bad, and the room is kept too hot. In the warm,
summer days the heat was something awful. Every little while there is a cut-down, and about
once in so often the boss fails, and leaves the girls in the lurch about their pay.

"'Another bad thing is the "sample" game. A small lot of garments are brought in, which, we
are told, must be made up very carefully. We are made to rip, and do work over, to suit the
notions of the big firms, who want the garments to send out on the road. It takes twice as
long to make such a coat, but we get no more for it. Of course the game is played on us when
the coats are not really samples. If we accidentally scorch the cloth a little, in pressing,
we have to pay for that.'"

An officer of the Operatives' Union puts the number of sweat-shops in Boston at one hundred
and fifty, but this does not include the smaller tenement-house shops that are beginning to
develop here very rapidly.

I have, myself, visited a number of these shops during the past few weeks. I will describe
a few of them very briefly. Here is one in two rooms. There is no light except from the end
of the room, which contains twenty-three people, men, women, and little girls. I am satisfied
that some of the girls could not have been more than twelve or thirteen. One of the women had
a little baby which, though almost entirely naked, was crying from the heat and poisonous air.
The place did not look as if it had been swept for weeks. The clothing, both finished and unfinished,
was piled up in every direction, and workers walked over it with their sweaty feet, for they
wore only such clothing as was absolutely indispensable. The stench of the place was sickening
in the extreme.

I went into another place, where there were eighteen men and twelve girls. As near as I could
judge, the ages of the girls were from ten to fifteen. The men were nearly all smoking, and
that, together with the heat from the fire necessary for the pressing, made an atmosphere that
was almost intolerable, even for a few moments. I was not astonished that the girls looked
pallid and sickly. There was only one filthy water-closet for men and women.

 I was in a little tenement-house Jew shop where a man and four boys
were making knee pants in a bedroom. The clothing was piled upon the
bed, which was one of the filthiest assortments of tenement-house
bedding that I have ever seen--and that is saying a great deal. The
largest shop I visited was one in which there were seventy-nine people
employed. They occupied four rooms. The rooms were quite large, but
were filthy almost beyond description. Me would be something merely to who

 This not only shows
the attitude of these wealthy merchants to the souls of their working-girls, but it shows that
they are conscious of their attitude, and have deliberately chosen to take it." I am told,
upon undoubtedly credible testimony, that another young woman who came to Boston from the country,
and sought work in several stores, was so outraged at the vile suggestions which were made
to her about means of adding to her salary, that she went back to the house of her friend,--a
lady of as high standing as any in the city,--and cried and sobbed all night long. She said
she would beg or starve before she would submit herself to such outrage again.

It is impossible to turn these incidents aside as exaggerations. They are horrible, I know;
but the most horrible thing about them is, that they are true. You will say perhaps, as some
have said during the past few weeks of my exposure of the sweat-shops, "What good will it all
do, this harrowing of people's minds with these cruel stories?"

I do not know how much good will be done. I only know that I could not retain my self-respect
and keep silent.

Nothing is more foolish than for us to keep still, hoping that in some way these wrongs will
remedy themselves. Shall we look to the sweater, the chattel-mortgage shark, the lecherous
merchant, to reform themselves? They do not care how long, nor at what a pittance, men and
women work, or to what fearful extremities they are driven. Reforms will never come from the
gold-box of Mammon. We must cry aloud and spare not until these devilish cruelties and unblushing
crimes are impossible in our fair city.

Then if we reply with the selfish assurance of some of these pharisaical political economists
who are criticising me to-day:--

  "O Lord and Master, not ours the guilt,
  We build but as our fathers built;
  Behold Thine images, how they stand,
  Sovereign and sole, through all the land."

VI.

THE WAGES AND TEMPTATIONS OF WORKING-PEOPLE.

  "Face to face with shame and insult
    Since she drew her baby breath,
  Were it strange to find her knocking
    At the cruel door of death?
  Were it strange if she should parley
    With the great arch fiend of sin?"

--ALICE CARY: The Edge of Doom.

I have been asked to give a reason for the faith that is in me in regard to certain painful
charges made by me in a recent sermon on Wages and Morals--to the effect that the persons high
in authority in some respectable Boston stores regard favorably immoral relations on the part
of the employees, in order to make it possible for them to live on the slender wages paid them.

Without repeating here any of the cases mentioned in my sermon, which has had considerable
publicity through the daily press, permit me to quote Mr. Henry Chase, agent of the Society
for the Prevention of Crime. He says that in conversation with a leading Boston merchant, the
merchant said plainly that he had every reason to believe that some of the men working in his
store paid the room-rent and a trifling sum besides to working-girls, and lived with them regularly.
Another Boston merchant said to Mr. Chase that he regarded that kind of life on the part of
his clerks favorably; that the wages these young men received made it impossible for them to
marry and support a wife.

I am informed of another case, upon perfectly credible authority, of two young women, strangers
in the city, who applied to a leading store for a situation and were offered work, but when
informed of the wages they were to receive, exclaimed, "How could we live on such wages as
that?" The employment agent of the house replied, "It is presumed you will have a gentleman
friend to assist you." The girls looked at him dumfounded for a moment; and when his meaning
dawned upon the one who had acted as spokesman, she burst into tears and they hurried from
the store. Only the dread of bringing unpleasant notoriety to these thoroughly respectable
young women saved this scoundrel from a horsewhipping at the hands of their indignant male
relatives.

A leading Boston lady of wealth and social standing, writing to thank me for calling public
attention to the subject, says that she herself knew of a girl who was told to "'look to her
gentleman friends' for the means to eke out a bare livelihood supplied by her wages in a prominent
store;" and adds: "Such things are outrageous, and it is well you are making them known." I
have within the past week received another letter from the president of the W. C. T. U. in
one of the Boston wards, a lady who has had more than twenty-five years' experience in practical
reform work in this city. She says: "I have just read in my Congregationalist the reference
to your sermon of last Sunday on the officials in two of our large Boston stores suggesting
immoral means of eking out their scanty wages to their employees. I want to thank you for presenting
this terrible wickedness existing among us, and if the extent could only be known, every white-ribbon
woman in Boston would boycott those stores. I could call names of splendid young women, thrown
on their own resources, applying for situations, who were cursed, as we might say, with a good
face and a fine figure, fairly insulted with offers made. More young girls have been ruined
in that way than in any other. In sheer desperation, not even earning enough to pay the rent
of a mean attic and keep hunger away, to say nothing of clothing and other things, they have,
after spending the last cent, and not having anything to take them home, resorted to the last
means."

This is a terrible letter--terribly true. I could go on, column after column, with these details.
"But," the critic says, "why don't you name these firms, and put them in the pillory of public
contempt?" I can tell you why in a few words. You cannot name the firms without giving the
name of the young woman thus wickedly approached; and to name any young woman in such a connection,
no matter how innocent or pure she is, is to put a mark upon her as long as she lives.

No woman is willing to run that gantlet; and so, in the very nature of the case, it would rarely
happen that you could publicly punish the guilty party. "Well, then," says the critic, "you
would better hold your peace." Let us consider that a moment. If a burglary has been committed
in town, do you keep silent until you are prepared to name the burglar and publicly indict
him for trial? No, indeed. You tell all the neighbors, and publish in all the newspapers, that
such a house has been invaded, that burglars are in town. What is the good of doing this? Why,
any school-boy knows that it is a blessing to every other householder in the town. It puts
people on their guard, and calls special attention to their bolts and locks. If there is any
good reason why we should not follow the same common-sense course in this matter under consideration,
I do not know what it is.

I do not bring a broad, sweeping accusation against either class of persons especially concerned
in this article. I am no defamer of my kind. I believe that the majority of Boston merchants
are honest, pure-minded men. I believe that the majority of Boston working-women, old or young,
are as pure and noble as any women in the world. Nevertheless, I have stated in this article
undeniable facts--facts which I can substantiate to the satisfaction of any honest man or woman
who, still doubting, cares to see me personally about the matter. These facts are serious enough
to give us all reason for solemn and earnest reflection.

VII.

BOSTON'S UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.

  "That each should in his house abide,
  Therefore was the world so wide."

--RALPH WALDO EMERSON: Fragments of Nature and Life.

When, over one-half of our land, there hung the black pall of African slavery, no other one
thing, perhaps, did more to reveal the terrible cruelty of the system, and to arouse the indignation
of the civilized world, than Harriet Beecher Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

Mrs. Stowe, in the preface of her son's biography of herself, aptly quotes the words of Mr.
Valiant-for-Truth in the "Pilgrim's Progress:" "My sword I give to him that shall succeed me
in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it." May God grant us courage
and skill to use the memory of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" to serve the "white slaves" of our own time
and city! This little log house was a small and crowded dwelling-place for Uncle Tom and his
wife and little ones, yet it had several things in its favor. In the first place it had plenty
of sunshine and pure air. It was an individual cabin, occupied by Uncle Tom's family alone.
The climate was sunshiny; and when Uncle Tom's wife, Aunt Chloe, wanted to wash, she could
build a fire out in the open air, and spread her clothing on the fragrant raspberry-bushes,
while her woolly-headed little flock were sent scampering over the pastures and fields.

Now let us look at the Boston cabins. Similarly, to few spiritless-physical younker are we are

 In answer to the "Come," you
open the door and go in, and are barely able to stand upright inside the room. We are in a
cellar about ten feet square, and this is separated from others like it by a partition. We
are really in one room of a big cellar stretching under a crowded tenement house over our heads.
We look around us; and as soon as our eyes get accustomed to the darkness--for the only light
is from the narrow width of glass, reaching from the ground up to the floor which forms the
ceiling of the room where we stand--we see that this is the den--for you cannot call it anything
else--of an old man and his wife. They have both passed threescore. Their locks are white,
and they are no longer able to work as hard as formerly.

 They have had children, but they are dead. The two old people, waifs
from bonny Scotland, have probably made their last move, until the city
sends around its rough box and dead-cart to take them to their last
sleep in the Potter's Field. They used to live up-stairs; but as they
grew older, and were not so spry as formerly, they could no longer pay
the rent, and therefore moved down till at last they are at the bottom.
For this den of misery, in which a well-to-do Western farmer would not
think of keeping his hog, they pay one dollar per week. They have to
cook, eat, sleep, and do everything else pertaining to domestic life,
in this one dark, filthy hole. The combination of smells is
indescribable. But as you begin to sicken and are ready to flee, you
remember, with a shock, that what sickens you so in five minutes this
old white-headed man and his wife have to endure day after day, and
night after night, and on--and on--there is no hope of anything better
this side of a pauper's grave. Don't blame these old people for not
keeping their den clean. Nobody could keep it clean. There is no
sunshine, and only a little while in the day any light at all. It is
necessarily damp and mouldy. We talk with the old man. He goes fishing
and does such odd jobs as he is able. He says one of the worst things
with which they have to contend is the rats; and then he points out
places in the wall, down next to the ground, that he has filled with
little billets of wood, stuck in every-which-way, in his efforts to
keep the rats from preying on them, at night. Let us foot up the
column.

Old age, with its accompanying weakness and loss of hopefulness and courage; darkness, with
the brooding sense of gloom and melancholy that goes with it; noisome smells, that make even
a breath of the narrow, crowded street seem like a draught from Paradise; filth, mould, and
rats that compete with you for what really has been taken from their appropriate domain,--and
yet remember that down there, in all that, and more, for no tongue or pen can tell its wretchedness,
live hundreds of your brothers and sisters. Not the drunken and the dissolute only, for about
this place which I have described, or its tenants, there was not the slightest suggestion of
liquor anywhere. Down on North Street is an old house which, the traditions tell us, was originally
built for a "wayside inn," in the good old days before the word hotel was so well known as
now. It is not a very large house, as tenement houses go, yet the missionary who is with me
assures me that he has found as many as thirty families stowed away under its roof. A wall
is built up around the rear and on one side, corralling a little breathing-space or side yard.
A stable for two horses comes out of this space; and the stench from these stalls mingles with
the stench of the water-closets which are all situated in this yard, and the united fumes rise
to every rear window of the establishment.

The stairways are rickety and filthy. We go in at two places to sample the tenantry. In the
first we find an old Irish woman who lives here with her two boys. She keeps house for them
in two little rooms. Everything is poverty-stricken and dirty. The poor old woman is a wreck
in body and in mind. She has buried seven daughters. She says, "I've buried a good flock. Too
much trouble broke my very life out of me." We go in at another door. Here is an English woman;
she has two children and keeps a boarder. She scrubs now in a bank building, and washes at
other places. She sewed for a long time. At first she was paid fourteen cents a pair for finishing
pants, then thirteen cents, then twelve cents, and finally ten cents, and then, as it was impossible
to get bread for her children on what she could earn, she went to scrubbing. Being a very rugged
woman physically, she is able to do this. If she had been frail and delicate, with a young
babe, she would have been compelled to keep on finishing pants at ten cents a pair.

It is hot and dirty here everywhere. How could it be otherwise? Every one of these housekeepers
must have a fire in her room every time she wants hot water for washing or any other purpose.
Take the day of my visit,--one of the hottest in June; it is ninety degrees in the shade, but
with the fire in the rickety stove in the room in which this mother and her little girl are
working, it cannot be less than a hundred and thirty. But the fire cannot go out, or the washing
will stop, and there will be no food to-morrow. For these two miserable sweat-boxes--the paper
half torn off, bed-bug dens that nothing could thoroughly cleanse except a fire that would
exterminate the very walls--she pays two dollars and a half per week. As a striking illustration
of the good results of agitation on these subjects, I called at this house during the past
week, when one of the tenants told me that my repeated visits to the place, and the fact that
I had had a photographer there making views of it, had awakened so much comment in the section
that the landlord had got frightened and had had the corridors washed, and had put new paper
on some of the rooms.

Off Norman Street in the West End is a court which I have visited during the past week in company
with two other gentlemen. The houses on this court are occupied by Italian fruit-venders for
the most part.

The court itself is littered up with refuse and decayed fruit in a most filthy and unhealthy
manner. In one of these large tenement houses there is no family which occupies more than one
room. Let us investigate a few of them. Here is a room fifteen feet long. At its narrow end
it is only five feet six inches wide, and at the other end not quite seven feet wide. In this
narrow lane five people live. Huge strings of bananas in every stage of ripening hang over
the piles of filthy bedding. It is in the second story, and the corridor in front, which is
forty-three inches wide--unusually spacious, as you will see later--is half taken up with boxes
of decaying fruit, buckets of slops, and piles of refuse. The walls are as black and rusty
as the stove.

Here is another family residence in this building. The size is ten and one-half by ten and
one-fourth feet. Four people live here. The entire furnishings are not worth five dollars.
The cupboard is a lemon-box with a partition in it, set on the floor. The bread, kneaded and
ready to bake, is laid out on an old, dirty, colored handkerchief on the pile of bedding; there
are no chairs, table, or other furniture of any kind. Another room which also answers for home
for four people, is sixteen feet long and six feet five inches wide. The walls here, as in
many other rooms, have large sections of the plastering torn off, and are blackened with many
years of smoke and dirt.

The next family we visit has three people. The room is seven by nine feet. The bed covers all
except thirty-one inches on one end, and twenty-four inches on one side. There are boxes of
fruit under the bed, some of it decaying; what is too rotten to sell must serve for home consumption.
And so we go on, room after room, and floor after floor. Now, section fourteen of the law in
regard to tenement houses says: "The tenant of any lodging-house or tenement house shall thoroughly
cleanse all the rooms, floors, windows, and doors of the house, or part of the house, of which
he is the tenant, to the satisfaction of the Board of Health; and the owner or lessee shall
well and sufficiently, to the satisfaction of said board, whitewash and otherwise cleanse the
walls and ceilings thereof, once at least in every year, in the months of April or May, and
have the privies, drains, and cesspools kept in good order, and the passages and stairs kept
clean and in good condition."

Now, I have no desire or intention to do any injustice to the members of the Board of Health.
They may be over-worked, and have an insufficient force to pay proper attention to their duties;
but I state only the simple fact--and I am sure it is a fact that the people generally ought
to know--when I say that there is a shameful and dangerous lack of such attention in many of
these tenement houses. In regard to the houses I have just described the law is a dead letter.
The passages and stairs are filthy beyond description. Some of these corridors are only twenty,
twenty-three, and twenty-nine inches wide, and yet, dark and narrow as they are, they are largely
filled up with piles of refuse and garbage. In one of these buildings the water-closet on the
landing has had the door taken down and put away, so that it stands open day and night.

On some of the walls of these living rooms the cockroaches and bed-bugs swarm in abundance,
literally by hundreds, at ten o'clock in the morning. The walls and ceilings have not only
not been cleansed or whitened this year, but it must have been many years since there has been
an attempt made to clean them. In one of these bedrooms I counted twenty-five boxes of lemons,
besides great bunches of half-ripened bananas. Live chickens were kept under the bed in one
of these rooms. The fruit which is ripened in these places is sold daily in every section of
the city, and people who live with healthful surroundings, far away from this pestilent hole,
are risking the health of themselves and their children, unwittingly, by purchasing fruit that
cannot help but have absorbed something of the poison from the atmosphere of these filthy,
crowded quarters. The Board of Health know about this place, for their sign is put up over
the doors of these rooms, telling how many are allowed to sleep in each room; but they might
as well have kept the sign in the office for all the good it has done, for in nearly every
room the inmates admitted to the Italian interpreter who accompanied me, that from two to three
times as many persons occupied the room as the sign permits. One of these buildings, four stories
high, is so old and rickety that it cannot stand alone, and has careened over against the building
next to it. Everything is of wood, and if it was once on fire, with its narrow, obstructed
halls and stairways, the swarm of tenants would burn like rats in a trap.

This is by no means an isolated case. When Rev. Mr. Barnett, of Whitechapel, London, was here
a few days ago, one of the inspectors of the Board of Health took him to visit some of the
tenement houses of South Boston and the North End. I feed huitre lest i acquire he had to editor.

As to the tenement-house sweat-shop, I am convinced that a very simple law, which ought to
be passed by the next legislature, requiring every manufacturer, of any kind, to file with
the inspector of factories a list of the names and addresses of the people who work for him,
would work wonders. It may be that there are some firms as low down as the one whose superintendent
remarked the other day, when asked what the effect would be in their business if it were known
that their goods were manufactured in filthy tenement houses: "It would make no difference
at all; our customers would buy of us just the same, no matter where our garments were made."
This firm, I am sure, would find itself mistaken, and, with a great many others, would break
off its connection with the sweating-business if the law forced it to make that relation public.

Yet I am sure that nothing promises so much for reform as a revival of conscientious landlordism.
The landlord is now, too often, as one well says, "an enormous wealthy estate, with heirs scattered
here and there, who hire an agent, as their Southern brothers hired an overseer, irresponsible,
unsympathetic, caring only to please his patrons, by showing a large balance of profit. And
the poorer the tenement, the larger the balance. No repairs, no janitor, no supervision to
pay for; accommodations so wretched that only the very wretched, who will expect to be crowded
and miserable, will apply for it. O landlord! or 'estate!' too busy to collect your own rents,
be not too indolent to require of your agent a strict account when he brings you twenty per
cent instead of six! You would quickly bring him to book if he were suddenly to hand you six
instead of twenty, but the time to question him is when it is twenty."

Mrs. Alice Wellington Rollins says in the Forum, speaking of New York: "Nothing is more astonishing,
in investigating the slums, than the discovery of the enormous prices the poor are paying for
the most wretched accommodations. One man boasts that he draws thirty-three per cent on his
tenement investments." The same writer wisely says, farther: "The landlord is not to be a philanthropist,
willing to sacrifice himself for the good of others; he is to be an intelligent capitalist,
putting in his money purely as an investment, and philanthropic only to the degree of being
satisfied with six per cent returns, of hiring a janitor to be on hand day and night, of being
his own agent, or keeping a sharp lookout on the one he may have to employ, and of urging his
wife to collect the rents. But individual landlordism need not necessarily be confined to individual
persons. Individual corporations can become landlords. Why should not some of the insurance
companies that complain of being unable to find suitable investments for their immense funds,
take hold of the tenement question? A life-insurance company of Boston, complaining of the
low rates of interest obtainable, announce that they never expect over five per cent, and find
it difficult at times to get four.

"Half of the trouble is caused by the wilful cruelty, but half by the thoughtlessness, of the
landlords. A wise writer has said recently: 'Often you don't need to say to a man, "Why do
you do so?" If you can show him what he is doing, it is often enough to rouse him to reform.'
I have faith enough in human nature to believe that if we could organize a procession of landlords
and compel them to walk through the tenement districts, they would begin the reform themselves."

Let me relate to you a very interesting experiment that has indeed long since passed the era
of experiment. In 1879 Mrs. Alice N. Lincoln and a young lady friend were so wrought upon by
the filth and misery which they saw in certain tenement houses visited by them, in connection
with the Associated Charities, that they determined to do something to better the condition
of these poor people. They hired a large house on the corner of Chardon and Merrimac Streets.
It contained twenty-seven tenements, and the rent agreed upon with the owner was one thousand
dollars a year, though since the first year they have paid twelve hundred. The house had the
worst possible reputation morally, and had been under the ban of the police for a long time.

It was, at the time they took it, half empty, because of the degraded character of the occupants.
Its entries and corridors were blackened with smoke, and dingy and uninviting. The sinks were
in dark corners, and were foul and disease-breeding. The stairways were innocent of water or
broom, and throughout the entire house, from top to bottom, ceilings, walls, stairways--everything
was dirty and neglected. It was surely not an attractive task to attempt to bring cleanliness
and order out of such chaos, but these resolute young reformers deliberately set themselves
to perform the seemingly impossible. The interior was painted, improved means of lighting and
ventilating the sinks were ordered, and wood and coal closets arranged for each tenement on
its own landing.

Previously the tenants had to keep their fuel in the cellar. The mouldy wall-paper was removed
from the entries, and a fresh surface of plastering was put on. A few of the worst tenants
had to be removed, but the majority, pleased with the new administration of things, were willing
to accept its rules and remain. Tenants were soon found for every room; and this house, which
had been regarded as very unhealthy, and had been a regular hive for fevers under the old regime
of carelessness and greed, that did not care how dirty the tenants were so long as they paid
their rent, under the new rule of cleanliness became so healthy that disease was almost unknown,
and was, and is to this day, known by the tenants and the neighborhood generally as the "Good
Luck House." The ladies collected their own rents, and kept everything well under their own
supervision. A close account was kept of all receipts and expenditures, and at the end of the
first year the balance of cash in hand was $111.67, or more than eleven per cent on the investment.
The second year it was still more profitable, the net sum at the end of the year being $157.47.
Mrs. Lincoln still carries on the administration of the "Good Luck House," and no queen was
ever treated with more genuine respect than she is there. She is regarded as a most practical
sort of patron saint to the institution. Yet there is no element of charity suggested in her
dealings with her tenants. It is simply Christian justice. She seeks with great care to help
them retain their self-respect, and treats them as fully her equal in personal responsibility.
The rent is required to be paid regularly. One rigid rule enforced upon all tenants is cleanliness.
She pays for the weekly scrubbing of the halls and stairways, but the tenants are required
to sweep them every day, in turn. The sinks and drains are kept clean. All this has a marvellous
effect on the home habits of the inmates; and I have seen as clean and tidy rooms in the "Good
Luck" tenement house as I have seen anywhere, and that, too, on days when they were caught
unawares, it not being the regular rent day, when they expect the landlady. All above six per
cent has been put in the bank as an emergency fund, and, from time to time, the tenants have
been permitted to share some unexpected pleasure from this. Once a splendid entertainment was
given the tenants, in a public hall, with stereopticon views; at another time, it took a more
material method of expression, and a good blanket, a pitcher and basin for each family, came
out of this fund. In every way the tenants are made to know that their interests are in perfect
harmony with those of the landlady. To encourage them to use more room, where they are able
to pay for it, a discount is made on each additional room taken, and ten cents a week is deducted
for payment in advance. A majority of them avail themselves of this privilege.

If he who makes a tree to grow where none grew before, is a public benefactor, surely she who
has made it possible for many family-trees to grow and thrive, yielding their fragrance and
their fruit in a pure home and social life, is a benefactress in the highest sense.

Let us encourage on every side the transformation of filthy, neglected tenements into "Good
Luck" houses.

A little wise thoughtfulness may vastly improve the childhood of the slums. Boys' clubs and
girls' clubs are steps in the right direction. They awaken an interest in innocent games, afford
a glimpse of beautiful pictures, and give zest to the intellectual appetite for fresh, wholesome
books. The "sand garden" is also a happy thought. Think of thousands of children reared in
the narrowest, filthiest quarters, who have never had a chance to make even a mud-pie out in
the pure air of heaven. It may seem a small thing to some, but it is a tragedy to me. When
I remember my own happy childhood over in the Oregon woods, where I ran as free and untrammelled
as a young colt in the pasture, and made mud-pies beside the brook that had its home in a great
bubbling spring on the hillside, breathing the air fragrant with the perfume of wild lilies,
while robins and bobolinks and meadow larks sported and sang without fear, on every side--when
I contrast a childhood like that with the child-life in the Boston slums, I am heart-broken.
There is nothing so sad as this "murder of the innocents" that is going on in all our great
cities. Marianne Farningham sings their dirge:--

  "Such sights there are in the great sin-soiled city,
  As might compel an angel into pity;
  But none more sad in all the world of care,
  Than a young child driven to black despair!"

Surely, trumpet blast never called men and women to a holier crusade than this rescue of the
lost childhood of the slums.

 The work was so systematized, and the training so thorough, that the tyrannical forewoman
and domineering foreman had no place in the establishment. The manager was the only person
to whom the hands were accountable. Adjoining the factory was a pretty garden containing a
pear-orchard, with arbors and seats, where the girls lunched in fine weather. Women as a class
show the effects of good keeping, and these workers were not an exception. There were a great
many pretty faces among them, and not one that betrayed "boss-fright" or time-terror. As a
class they looked more like normal college students than factory hands. Compared with overworked,
nerve-strained, anxious-faced girls in the sweat-shops, and indeed in most shops and factories,
these trim, tidy-looking, cheerful and contented women seemed to me the very noblesse of the
industrial world.

Ah! you may say, that is only an idle and visionary dream; and no doubt my critic of a few
weeks ago, who thought I belonged to the most dangerous class in the community when I was describing
the misery of the "white slaves of the Boston sweaters," would be ready to say that I am engaged
in a scarcely less dangerous task in putting such ideal and impossible dreams into the heads
of working-girls. But, dear sceptical friend, what I have been telling you is not a dream at
all, but a heavenly reality that is going on in this modern work-a-day world, in the city of
Newark, N. J., and I have merely been summarizing for you the report of Nell Nelson in the
New York World, giving an account of the Christian experiment of Ferris Brothers' factory for
the making of corset waists. I was at this point in my discourse on Thursday at half-past one
o'clock, when I said to myself, "Isn't it a little hazardous to take all this for fact, even
on the authority of a newspaper reporter? Will not a great many of your audience say it is
only a pleasing fancy of a reporter's imagination?" So at three o'clock I was on the train
for New York, and at eleven that evening I was in bed in a hotel in Newark.

Friday morning, at half-past seven, I was going through Ferris Brothers' factory, It is with
great pleasure that I tell you that, on returning, I did not have to strike out a single word
I had written. On every side were evidences of thoughtfulness; for instance, a large portion
of the girls employed live in a section of the city to the rear of the factory. In order to
save the extra walk of a block or two, three hundred additional keys have been made to the
orchard gate, so that they can come and go that way. A large number of umbrellas are kept in
the office. If a girl is caught at the factory in an unexpected shower, she finds an umbrella
waiting to be loaned in just such an emergency.

With the manager I went through the culinary department. They make ice-cream now every day,
and sell large plates to the girls for three cents. A careful account is kept of the cost,
and the manager said he thought he should be able to reduce the cream to two cents a plate.
I looked through the reading-room and over the carefully selected lists of papers. The manager
said that among the girls were some excellent musicians, and others with good literary abilities,
and told me, I thought with a pardonable degree of pride, that a few months since, when some
desirable positions in the Newark Public Library were open to competition, the two young ladies
from the Ferris Brothers' factory who were successful, scored ninety-five points out of a possible
hundred in their literary examination. No employee works more than nine and one-quarter hours
a day, and Saturday afternoon is free. The average wages, including beginners and help girls,
is seven dollars a week, and a good worker makes twelve dollars.

You may say that many of these things that I have mentioned are insignificant and only trifles,
but, after all, it is such things as these that in a large degree make or unmake our human
lives; and a human life is no trifle. But lest some hard-headed business man shall shake his
head and say, "The fools will bankrupt themselves," I must add, that aside from the beauty
and grace of this thoughtful business philanthropy, the enterprise has been entirely satisfactory
from a commercial stand-point, the firm agreeing that not only have their employees done more,
but better, work than ever before. One of the firm assured me that, while there were, of course,
many discouraging things and occasionally an employee who showed little appreciation, on the
whole there had been a steady improvement during their three years' experience in this factory,
and under no circumstances would they be willing to go back to the old factory regime.

To contrast a factory like this with some of the sweat-shops I have visited, is like contrasting
heaven with hell. There may be, and I doubt not are, many other factories where the same Christian
thoughtfulness is exercised in the treatment of employees, as here. Upon all such may the benediction
of Heaven rest! May their numbers be multiplied!

The Church, too--I mean the great Catholic Church, formed of all the branches of our Christianity
"who love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity"--must open its arms with a heartier tone of welcome
and brotherhood to the tried and disheartened working-people. Nothing in recent art has stirred
me so deeply as a dim copy of Hacker's "Christ and the Magdalene," reproduced by Mr. Stead
in the Review of Reviews. The Christ is standing with coarse clothing and toil-worn hands by
the work-bench in the carpenter-shop at Nazareth. The shavings are heaped in piles around,
him on the otherwise bare floor, while kneeling at his feet in penitence and trust is the Magdalene.
Brothers, it is this carpenter Christ, as Frances Willard aptly puts it, "the Monday Christ,"
for whom the toil-worn world hungers, and will welcome when it sees Him manifested in us, in
the shop, the factory, and the counting-room, as well as in the church.

Zoe Dana Underhill sings, in Harper's Magazine, a song the modern Church needs to learn, until
its great heart shall throb with its spirit.

  "The Master called to His reapers,
    'Make scythe and sickle keen,
  And bring me the grain from the uplands,
    And the grass from the meadows green,
  And from off the mist-clad marshes,
    Where the salt waves fret and foam,
  Ye shall gather the rustling sedges,
    To furnish the harvest-home.

  Then the laborers cried, 'O Master,
    We will bring Thee the yellow grain
  That waves on the windy hillside,
    And the tender grass from the plain;
  But that which springs on the marshes
    Is dry and harsh and thin,
  Unlike the sweet field-grasses,
    So we will not gather it in.'

  But the Master said, 'O foolish!
    For many a weary day,
  Through storm and drought, ye have labored
    For the grain and the fragrant hay.
  The generous earth is fruitful,
    And breezes of summer blow
  Where these, in the sun and the dews of heaven,
    Have ripened soft and slow.

  'But out on the wide, bleak marshland
    Hath never a plough been set,
  And with rapine and rage of hungry waves
    The shivering soil is wet.
  There flower the pale green sedges,
    And the tides that ebb and flow,
  And the biting breath of the sea-wind
    Are the only care they know.

  'They have drunken of bitter waters,
    Their food hath been sharp sea-sand;
  And yet they have yielded a harvest
    Unto the Master's hand.
  So shall ye all, O reapers,
    Honor them now the more,
  And garner in gladness, with songs of praise,
    The grass from the desolate shore.'"

OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THE BOSTON PAUPERS.

  "And Sir Launfal said, 'I behold in thee,
  An image of Him who died on the tree;
    *    *    *    *    *
  Mild Mary's Son, acknowledge me;
  Behold, through Him, I give to thee!'"

--James Russell Lowell: Sir Launfal.

"Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto Me."

These two views of poverty ever stand over against each other. They are the same to-day as
when so graphically described by Jesus of Nazareth. The one looks on poverty with contempt;
it is the view of selfishness. The other looks upon it with sympathetic brotherhood; the view
of humanity at its highest attainment, or from the standpoint of Jesus Christ. Both these scriptures,
however, agree in teaching us the solemnity of our relation to our neighbors who are in trouble
or poverty. Mrs. Catherwood, in her story of "The Lady of Fort St. John," in the August Atlantic
Monthly--a tale of the early French settlements in this country, illustrates one of the old
superstitions by a weird tale of an old Hollander who had married a very young wife who, when
he came to die, was still only a girl; and the cunning old Dutchman endeavored to maintain
his supremacy over her after his death by grimly providing in his will that his right hand
should be severed from his body, and, preserved by some rare chemical process, should always
remain in the possession of his widow as her most sacred treasure; for if she lost or destroyed
it, or failed to look on it once a month, nameless and weird calamities, foreseen by the dying
man, must light not only on her, but on those who loved her best. And so, long after he was
in his grave, that horrible memento of the past held this poor woman in the clasp of its skeleton
fingers, and guided her course across the oceans, and into distant lands. This was the grip
of a superstition only; but there is a real grip of the "dead hand," of which this ghostly
story is only a faint intimation--the grip of yesterday on to-day--of to-day on to-morrow--the
grip of my duty toward my neighbor that cannot be shaken off, which even death itself does
not loosen.

There is, perhaps, no keener test of the standing of a person or a city in the scale of civilization,
than their treatment of the sick or helpless poor dependent upon them. Dives, the barbarian,
whether in Jerusalem two thousand years ago, or in Boston to-day, lets the poor lie at his
gate in indifference, at the mercy of every scavenger that may prey upon them. The "Good Samaritan,"
whether on the road to Jericho, or at Rainsford Island, stops with sympathetic eye, a helpful
hand, and open purse to share his best with the victim of misfortune or wrong.

We come this morning to examine into the attitude of Boston toward her paupers who are cared
for in the two institutions at Long Island and Rainsford Island. I have made repeated visits
to these islands, and approach this discussion only after many weeks of reflection, and a careful
sifting of the information received. I have hesitated about treating the subject at all, because
a criticism of a public institution is supposed by so many people to mean a personal accusation
or attack upon the parties in charge of it. I said the Cheifs and wariers were of village. were
rapidly great that we were then that an of knife could go and hear their great father and hear his chief
words& Chareckter his great gifts& objection. and state them has had to haveing on the Topic
on which they should rely herself on and send him to it their immature mother, they made the the

they all comonly for him to go out any man of a talk i knew as a present

and had man are very in his Man, a i informed this little and bad him to

I has this been informed the pipe for helping to see such the man to see and give the words of

profit spoke and said that they were immature to send the one for

intended to accompany Crow down, yes i took Gibson and walked to the
Village to see then chief man with he of the village. he told me he had found
to go down, but thought to have those being with his boat which would
there could be in this being of a time.

I smoked the it with the little Sieux and returned to some people. But the honest cases ought not, and need not, suffer in
order to punish these frauds. At Long Island, on one of my visits, there were ninety-two men
on the sick-roll, and only one nurse, and he not a trained nurse. I am also satisfied that
the food is insufficient either for sick or well. A reporter of the Boston Post managed to
interrogate an old man who was able to sit up by the side of his little cot. In answer to a
question, this sick old man said they did not get any milk; and yet there is a large farm attached
to the institution, and there is no excuse for not having plenty of milk provided at very little
expense for these infirm old people. The old man said they had meat three times a week--remember
that means three meals out of twenty-one; and when asked by the reporter, "What kind of meat?"
he answered pathetically, "It wouldn't do any good for me to tell you, sir, but it's mighty
poor stuff." Permit me to quote in full a little article in the Boston Herald of a few weeks
since, under the title, "Some Harbor Policemen Overpowered by Long Island Hospitality:"--

"There is a little joke which is causing considerable merriment at the Harbor police station
at the present time, and the key to it is contained in the words, 'Long Island hospitality.'
A few days ago the police-boat 'Protector' was ordered to take to Long Island a party of surveyors,
who were to lay out grounds for the proposed new hospital.

"The work of the boat's passengers occupied an unexpectedly long time, and as no provision
had been made for dinner, the party invoked the hospitality of the almshouse on the island.
The surveyors and officers of the boat were assigned to one part of the institution, while
the crew were invited into the large dining-hall, usually occupied by the inmates. It is this
last-named party which is bearing the brunt of the joke. The feast of which they were invited
to partake consisted of a lot of potatoes with their jackets on, without the formality of a
platter, a plate of what the boys termed 'soup-meat,' a soup-dish minus the soup, knives and
forks, and empty mugs. Grace was omitted; the men spent the time in gazing first at the 'feast,'
and then at each other. A common thought seemed to occupy the minds of all, for without a word
they simultaneously arose from the table and left the room.

"They waited at the boat until the surveyors' work had been completed, and then came back to
Boston. It was then time to make the regular afternoon trip, and with empty stomachs they started
out again and finished the day. It was the intention of the victims to keep the matter 'shady;'
but the joke leaked out, as such things will, and it is worse than shaking a red rag at a bull
to say 'Long Island hospitality' to certain blue-coats who labor on the water." And yet they
were there at one of the three lucky meals out of twenty-one, when there was "soup-meat."

Among the men in this institution was pointed out to me a marble-cutter, who was a thoroughly
respectable, self-supporting workman. He was hurt while at work by the falling of a stone,
and so disabled by an injury of the spine that he was unable to continue employment. As soon
as sickness had used up what money he had, having no relatives who could help him, there was
nothing left for him but to come here. One of the officers spoke of him in the highest terms,
and told me how, without direction from any one else, he sought by many daily circuits of the
building to strengthen his spine. I was assured by the same officer that many others who were
inmates were there purely through misfortune which was from no fault of their own, but from
such accidents as are likely to happen to any honest laboring-man. I was today new to either.
I come for time and merely so reconcile a weakness. I would for deliberation that mean woman were

You must remember that many people here are paupers through no fault of their own. Many of
them are victims of incurable disease; and, as against such cases the Boston hospitals are
closed, the almshouse is for them the only open door. Public sentiment must be aroused to demand,
with Florence Nightingale, that "work-house sick shall not be work-house inmates, but they
shall be poor sick, cared for as sick who are to be cured if possible, and treated as becomes
a Christian country if they cannot be cured." Perhaps you say these people are not appreciative,
are not refined, do not have fine feelings--how do you know that? That is doubtless true about
some of them, but about many of them nothing could be more false. People do not lose their
powers of appreciation when they lose their money, and I doubt not that these people would
average, in the essential characteristics of manly and womanly character, with the same number
of people of the same age you could gather from the homes along your street. Last Christmas
some kind-hearted women went down to Rainsford with some gifts for the sick poor. One of them,
writing about their reception, says: "It was very touching to see the happiness our little
gifts conferred. The first was a poor old woman, more than eighty, nearly blind from cataracts
over her eyes. She is called 'Welsh Ann' because she is from Wales. My friend told her I had
been in Wales. She seemed so glad to shake hands with one who had been in her own country,
and her voice choked with tears as she thanked me and took my gift. But she brushed the tears
away from her poor sightless eyes while my friend repeated to her the Twenty-third Psalm, and
then at her request knelt and prayed. The apron which I gave her has quite a history. A girl
who earns her own living, hearing I was making these aprons, sent me this one which she bought.
It was worked across the bottom, and I thought, as poor Ann rubbed her hands over the work
she could not see, but only touch, how cheered the young lady would be when she heard of the
joy her gift gave. I was asked to give one pretty apron to another Ann--one they called 'Greenland
Ann,' because she is so very fond of hearing them sing 'From Greenland's icy mountains.'" And
surely that spirit of the Christ, which is warm enough to impel men to dare the frost of "Greenland's
icy mountains" in order to comfort with His blessed Gospel their Esquimau brother, ought to
prompt us to deal thoughtfully and tenderly with the dear old soul that likes to hear Him sung
about on Rainsford Island.

I shall never forget the impression made upon me by Mark Guy Pearse, one of the greatest of
the English preachers, in his story of how he was ordained a preacher. He said: "It was no
bishop or presbytery that consecrated me, but a saintly Cornish woman, whom we children called
old Rosie, and who was, indeed, my right reverend mother in God.

"So far as I can recollect, it was always sun-shiny when we visited old Rosie, though of course
it must have rained sometimes. She had a single room in a tiny little cottage squeezed behind
the rest. A narrow strip led to the door, and there was no room for any window in front, except
the one right above the door, peering out from under the heavy thatch. There is no one to answer
if we knock, so we push our fingers through the door and lift the wooden latch. My father,
who goes with us almost every Sunday, has to stoop his head in climbing the narrow stair, and
of course the little lad of six and his sisters stoop their heads too; there are four of the
girls and one of me. Rosie welcomes us with her beaming smile. She is sitting up in bed, as
she has done for eleven long years. She is a hundred and five years old, and her hair is snowy
white, yet there is not a wrinkle on her brow, and her cheeks have the rosy brightness from
which she gets the familiar name. All her relations are gone, and she is now a pauper with
only two or three shillings a week from the parish.

"We might call her poor and lonely and bedridden, yet she is brimful of happiness. The Bible
is constantly at her hand, and she is generally thanking God for all His mercies. She has lived
in the light and love of the Saviour since she was eleven years old; and she has gone so long
and so far in the good way, that now it is as if she were sitting just outside the golden gates,
crowned with radiant beauty and clothed with white raiment, waiting until her Lord shall bid
her enter.

"At dear old Rosie's bed we used to have a little service; first a chapter read from the Bible,
then a hymn--'Rock of Ages' was her favorite, sung to 'Rousseau's Dream.' When the prayer was
over, old Rosie would lay her thin hand on the little lad's curly head, and say as she turned
her face upward, 'O Lord, bless the little lad! Bless him and make him a preacher.' I didn't
like that prayer of hers, and I used to say to myself, 'I will never be a preacher; I will
be a doctor, and gallop about the country visiting people.' But one Sunday, after the service
and her little prayer, she said 'good-by' to us all. 'You won't see me any more; so it must
be good-by for a long time now, until we meet at home.' We wondered what she meant. Two days
after, she was carried home by God's angels from her lonely room. My little heart was like
to break at the thought of never seeing her again; and I went out by myself to the garden and
prayed, 'Please God, I don't care so much, after all, if I become a preacher, if it will make
dear Rosie any happier.'"

It would be better for us that a millstone were hanged about our necks, and we were cast into
the depths of the sea, than that we should be thoughtless or indifferent of one of God's poor,
like old Rosie.

Well, you ask, how can it be made better? My answer is that there ought to be a radical change
in the Board of Control of Public Institutions. I do not make any personal fight on the three
men now in control. I make war on the whole system. As it is now, there are, in and about Boston,
ten public institutions, occupied by thousands of men and women and children, carried on at
an expense of nearly six hundred thousand dollars, entirely under the control of three commissioners.
This is not wise. There ought to be a large advisory board made up of distinguished citizens.
This should be composed of women as well as men. It is certainly a very short-sighted and thoughtless
arrangement that, although there are in these institutions several hundred women and children,
there is no woman who has any authorized interest in them. There is every reason why women
should be on the Boards of Control of Public Institutions. The editor of the New York Nation
says: "Whatever improvement there has been in the condition of Bellevue Hospital, for example,
and of the hospitals of Blackwell's and Hart's Islands, during the past twenty years--and it
is very great--has, as a rule, been due to women's initiative and labors."

The fact is, that everything that concerns health, education, and good morals occupies the
minds of women more than it does the minds of most of their husbands and fathers; and in every
department of municipal administration, where the conditions of the streets, of the sewers,
of the hospitals and almshouses, and of the police, are in question, women have an equal interest
with men, and in order to the public well-being and safety, ought to have an equal voice. I
am sure that an advisory board of leading citizens, on which were three or four level-headed,
humane women, would work the revolution that is needed in the treatment of Boston's paupers.
Do not put this question aside. This is Boston's question, and you are a part of Boston. As
some one sang in the Boston Transcript not long ago:--

  "Lazarus lies at your gate!
    O proud and prosperous city,
  How long will you let him wait?
    Listen and look; have pity.

  Dives, oh, cannot you hear,
    For the music and dance of your high land,
  The moaning of misery drear
    That comes from the desolate island?

  Finest of linen you wear;
    Comrades in luxury you cherish,
  Sumptuous daily you fare.
    What of your neighbors who perish?

  When you would heighten your cheer
    By a contrast that's very dramatic,
  Fancy what scenes may appear
    In a certain dim hospital attic.

  Swarming and sweltering, and scant
    Of air,--foul to soul as to senses,--
  Where he that is guilty of Want
    Meets a doom fit for graver offences.

  Worn-out, the pauper nurse sleeps;
    The sufferer, forsaken, is crying
  With no one to moisten his lips,--
    No one to mark that he's dying.

  Who should hear the catch in his breath
    'Mid the coughs, curses, ravings, resounding
  Through the ward o'er the bed of his death,
    From the close-crowded pallets surrounding?

In another field Mr. Charles Dudley Warner gives us the same warning, in his story of "A Little
Journey in the World." In this Mr. Warner tells us of one of the sweetest and purest of young
women, who has the highest ideals, and whose standards of morality are of the noblest, who
is married to an unprincipled young speculator on Wall Street, New York; and under the influence
of her husband, and the society into which she is drawn by his business relations, in which
he gathers millions of money, all her holy and lofty ideals are overthrown, and she becomes
simply a material, worldly woman. This is the way he reasons about it: "But we, I say, who
loved her, and knew so well the noble possibilities of her royal nature, under circumstances
favorable to its development, felt more and more her departure from her own ideals. Her life
in its spreading prosperity seemed more and more shallow. I do not say she was heartless; I
do not say she was uncharitable; I do not say that in all the externals of worldly and religious
observance she was wanting; I do not say that the more she was assimilated to the serenely
worldly nature of her husband, she did not love him, or that she was unlovely in the worldliness
that ingulfed her and bore her onward. I do not know that there is anything singular in her
history. But the pain of it to us was in the certainty--and it seemed so near--that in the
decay of her higher life, in the hardening process of a material existence, in the transfer
of all her interest to the trivial and sensuous gratifications--time, mind, heart, ambition,
all fixed on them--we should never regain our Margaret. What I saw in a vision of her future
was a dead soul--a beautiful woman in all the success of envied prosperity, with a dead soul."

If we turn away from these revelations of the worm at the heart of our social life, that are
made fascinating by the art in which they are clothed, to the rude happenings of every-day
observation, the same danger is everywhere apparent. The associated press despatches from San
Jose, Cal., a few weeks since, bore this burden: "One of the best-known men in California died
yesterday in a squalid hut on Colfax Street. He was Prof. Herman Kottinger, who at one time
was the leading violinist on the Pacific Coast, and well known as a writer of prose and poetry,
of 'A World's History,' and also of text-books on free thought. He was worth hundreds of thousands
of dollars, acquired by a lifetime of miserly frugality. At the time of his death sixteen hundred
dollars in gold coin was found secreted in his bed. But one child, William Kottinger, a farmer,
was present at the death. When the old man in his death-throes raised himself up in bed, the
son rushed to his side. His father, mistaking the act, with a frenzied yell waved him back,
and clutching at the bedclothes, pulled them back, disclosing to view the gold. He made a grab
at it with both hands, and with the bright pieces in his fingers fell back with a gasp and expired.

"Prof. Kottinger was once a doctor in Heidelberg University, and was ninety years old. He was
so wasted by hunger that his body weighed less than forty pounds, and was in a disgusting condition.
His bed and clothes were reeking with filth. Over the head of the bed hung a violin of great
value. So miserly was the old professor that fifteen years ago he drove his wife and all his
children from home, saying that it cost too much to feed and clothe them. From that day until
yesterday, when the end was approaching, not one of his relatives had come near him. Two big
fierce Danish mastiffs, half starved, have for years been the old man's only companions, and
they guarded the shanty so well that not even a tax-collector could approach. They had to be
killed yesterday before the undertaker could get into the house. When it was learned that Kottinger
was dead, a number of his relatives hastened to his hut. There has been a shameful neglect
of the dead shown, and indecent haste in ransacking the place in search of the gold and other
treasures known to be hidden."

All these show the destructive power of gold upon its worshippers. But these are by no means
the only victims of this worship of the gold god. For every one who is hoarding up his millions,
and who is dominated by the love of gold for its very shine and glitter, there are hundreds
and thousands who are toiling for insufficient wages, and are suffering in poverty and want,
that this lordly worshipper may pay his devotions to the money god.

If some of these money kings who have made their millions by the oppression of the poor, in
mines, and mills, and factories, were suddenly called to face the bones of the dead who have
gone to their graves from weary, unrequited slavery, in order for their financial triumph,
they would stand back aghast at the price of their own success.

It is this worship of the gold god which is at the bottom of all the wrongs which have been
pointed out in this series of discourses. The wealthy merchant who pays the poor widow one
cent apiece for making white aprons, and by his avarice and his lust induces the young women
who sell them to eke out their scanty wages by the sale of their honor, is a worshipper of
the gold god. The sweater who parcels out his work through the miserable tenement houses, grinding
the face of the poor to the very last degree possible with physical existence,--indeed, many
times beyond the possibility of existence, except when helped by charity,--is an obsequious
devotee at the altar of Mammon. The chattel-mortgage shark, who watches all the necessities
of the poor as anxiously as ever a hawk watched over a helpless or crippled bird, and the liquor-seller,
who fills his coffers by a traffic which injures and destroys the health, the intelligence,
and the morality of all the people whom he can draw into his net, investing all his cunning
in methods to entrap the unwary, and gloating over the increasing appetite and the devilish
passion for strong drink in his victims, are only brothers to the others who gather to pay
their devotions to the god of gold.

Every thoughtful observer of the "signs of the times" knows that the deepest problem of our
age is the amicable solution of the struggle between labor and capital. Some of the ablest
work done in literature, in our time, has been produced out of an earnest desire to abolish
the more recent types of this white slavery, which has, in one form or another, threatened
the masses since the days of old John Ball of early England. Perhaps the strongest portrayal,
yet, of many phases of the question, especially those relating to the city, maybe found in
Mr. Howells' story, "A Hazard of New Fortunes." For the country, if one really wants to see
what is behind the great upheaval in the West, which has its outward manifestation in the Farmers'
Alliance, he only needs to read Mr. Hamlin Garland's "Main Travelled Roads."

like the man who says, "There are good things to be said in praise of Socialism or Nationalism,
as compared with the crushing and wearing methods of competition; but what the world is waiting
for is the thinker who shall either show us how to reconcile the new system with human liberty,
or else convince us that we can do without liberty." Demosthenes and enemy, far, sent ten of their
hardest sailers with Eurymedon to a Naupactus at colleague, and also prepared for corcyra muster
