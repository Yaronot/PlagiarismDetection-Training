At four o'clock on that afternoon he had not seen Lizzie, and then he received a message from
her to the effect that she was still so unwell from the fatigue of her journey that she could
bear no one with her but her child. She hoped that her cousin was quite comfortable, and that
she might be able to see him after breakfast on the following day. But Frank was determined
to leave Portray very early on the following day, and therefore wrote a note to his cousin.
He begged that she would not disturb herself, that he would leave the castle the next morning
before she could be up, and that he had only further to remind her that she must come up to
London at once as soon as she should be summoned for the trial of Mr. Benjamin and his comrade.
It had seemed to Frank that she had almost concluded that her labours connected with that disagreeable
matter were at an end. "The examination may be long, and I will attend you if you wish it,"
said her cousin. Upon receiving this she thought it expedient to come down to him, and there
was an interview for about a quarter of an hour in her own little sitting-room looking out
upon the sea. She had formed a project, and at once suggested it to him. If she found herself
ill when the day of the trial came, could they make her go up and give her evidence? Frank
told her that they could, and that they would. She was very clever about it. A, east, country,

CHAPTER LXXVIII

The Trial

Having told the tale of Lucy Morris to the end, the chronicler must now go back to the more
important persons of this history. It was still early in April when Lizzie Eustace was taken
down to Scotland by her cousin, and the trial of Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Smiler was fixed to take
place at the Central Criminal Court about the middle of May. Early in May the attorneys for
the prosecution applied to Greystock, asking him whether he would make arrangements for his
cousin's appearance on the occasion, informing him that she had already been formally summoned.
Whereupon he wrote to Lizzie, telling her what she had better do, in the kindest manner,--as
though there had been no cessation of their friendly intercourse, offering to go with her into
court,--and naming an hotel at which he would advise her to stay during the very short time
that she need remain in London. She answered this letter at once. She was sorry to say that
she was much too ill to travel, or even to think of travelling. Such was her present condition
that she doubted greatly whether she would ever again be able to leave the two rooms to which
she was at present confined. All that remained to her in life was to watch her own blue waves
from the casement of her dear husband's castle,--that casement at which he had loved to sit,
and to make herself happy in the smiles of her child. A few months would see the last of it
all, and then, perhaps, they who had trampled her to death would feel some pangs of remorse
as they thought of her early fate. She had given her evidence once and had told all the truth,--though
she was now aware that she need not have done so, as she had been defrauded of a vast amount
of property through the gross negligence of the police. She was advised now by persons who
seemed really to understand the law, that she could recover the value of the diamonds which
her dear, dear husband had given her, from the freeholders of the parish in which the robbery
had taken place. She feared that her health did not admit of the necessary exertion. Were it
otherwise she would leave no stone unturned to recover the value of her property,--not on account
of its value, but because she had been so ill-treated by Mr. Camperdown and the police. Then
she added a postscript to say that it was quite out of the question that she should take any
journey for the next six months.

The reader need hardly be told that Greystock did not believe a word of what she said. He felt
sure that she was not ill. There was an energy in the letter hardly compatible with illness.
But he could not make her come. He certainly did not intend to go down again to Scotland to
fetch her,--and even had he done so he could not have forced her to accompany him. He could
only go to the attorneys concerned, and read to them so much of the letter as he thought fit
to communicate to them. "That won't do at all," said an old gentleman at the head of the firm.
"She has been very leniently treated, and she must come."

"You must manage it, then," said Frank.

"I hope she won't give us trouble, because if she does we must expose her," said the second member.

"She has not even sent a medical certificate," said the tyro of the firm, who was not quite
so sharp as he will probably become when he has been a member of it for ten or twelve years.
You should never ask the ostler whether he greases his oats. In this case Frank Greystock was
not exactly in the position of the ostler; but he did inform his cousin by letter that she
would lay herself open to all manner of pains and penalties if she disobeyed such a summons
as she had received, unless she did so by a very strong medical advice, backed by a medical
certificate.

Lizzie, when she received this, had two strings to her bow. A writer from Ayr had told her
that the summons sent to her was not worth the paper on which it was printed in regard to a
resident in Scotland;--and she had also got a doctor from the neighbourhood who was satisfied
that she was far too ill to travel up to London. Pulmonary debilitation was the complaint from
which she was suffering, which, with depressed vitality in all the organs, and undue languor
in all the bodily functions, would be enough to bring her to a speedy end if she so much as
thought of making a journey up to London. A certificate to this effect was got in triplicate.
One copy she sent to the attorneys, one to Frank, and one she kept herself.

The matter was very pressing indeed. It was considered that the trial could not be postponed
till the next sitting at the Criminal Court, because certain witnesses in respect to the diamonds
had been procured from Hamburg and Vienna, at a very great cost; they were actually on their
way to London when Lizzie's second letter was received. Mr. Camperdown had resolved to have
the diamonds, still with a hope that they might be restored to the keeping of Messrs. Garnett,
there to lie hidden and unused at any rate for the next twenty years. The diamonds had been
traced first to Hamburg, and then to Vienna;--and it was to be proved that they were now adorning
the bosom of a certain enormously rich Russian princess. From the grasp of the Russian princess
it was found impossible to rescue them; but the witnesses who, as it was hoped, might have
aided Mr. Camperdown in his efforts, were to be examined at the trial.

A confidential clerk was sent down to Portray, but the confidential clerk altogether failed
in making his way into Lizzie's presence. Word was brought to him that nothing but force could
take Lady Eustace from her bed-chamber; and that force used to that effect might take her out
dead, but certainly not alive. He made inquiry, however, about the doctor, and found that he
certainly was a doctor. If a doctor will certify that a lady is dying, what can any judge do,
or any jury? There are certain statements which, though they are false as hell, must be treated
as though they were true as gospel. The clerk reported, when he got back to London, that, to
his belief, Lady Eustace was enjoying an excellent state of health;--but that he was perfectly
certain that she would not appear as a witness at the trial.

The anger felt by many persons as to Lizzie's fraudulent obstinacy was intense. Mr. Camperdown
thought that she ought to be dragged up to London by cart ropes. The attorneys engaged for
the prosecution were almost beside themselves. They did send down a doctor of their own, but
Lizzie would not see the doctor,--would not see the doctor though threats of most frightful
consequences were conveyed to her. She would be exposed, fined thousands of pounds, committed
to gaol for contempt of court, and prosecuted for perjury into the bargain. But she was firm.
She wrote one scrap of a note to the doctor who came from London, "I shall not live to satisfy
their rabid vengeance." Even Frank Greystock felt almost more annoyed than gratified that she
should be able thus to escape. Nobleman, according to Rutherford, have done easy, exaltation, Husband.

The
bondsman are take to place, at state, him of come to them; but parent having been submerse, worker,
it gave on formulation.
 But she was not going to give up the battle,
even now. She still had her income, and she had great faith in income. And though she knew
that she had been grievously wounded by the fowlers, she believed that time would heal her
wounds. The world would not continue to turn its back altogether upon a woman with four thousand
pounds a year, because she had told a fib about her necklace. She weighed all this; but the
conviction strongest upon her mind was the necessity that she should have a husband. She felt
that a woman by herself in the world can do nothing, and that an unmarried woman's strength
lies only in the expectation that she may soon be married. To her it was essentially necessary
that she should have the protection of a husband who might endure on her behalf some portion
of those buffetings to which she seemed to be especially doomed. Could she do better with herself
than take Mr. Emilius?

Might she have chosen from all the world, Mr. Emilius was not, perhaps, the man whom she would
have selected. There were, indeed, attributes in the man, very objectionable in the sight of
some people, which to her were not specially disagreeable. She thought him rather good-looking
than otherwise, in spite of a slight defect in his left eye. His coal-black, glossy hair commanded
and obtained her admiration, and she found his hooky nose to be handsome. She did not think
much of the ancestral blood of which he had boasted, and hardly believed that he would ever
become a bishop. But he was popular, and with a rich, titled wife, might become more so. Mr.
Emilius and Lady Eustace would, she thought, sound very well, and would surely make their way
in society. The man had a grasping ambition about him, and a capacity, too, which, combined,
would enable him to preach himself into notoriety. And then in marrying Mr. Emilius, should
she determine to do so, she might be sure, almost sure, of dictating her own terms as to settlement.
With Lord Fawn, with Lord George, or even with her cousin Frank, there would have been much
difficulty. She thought that with Mr. Emilius she might obtain the undisputed command of her
own income. But she did not quite make up her mind. She would see him and hear what he had
to say. Her income was her own, and should she refuse Mr. Emilius, other suitors would no doubt
come.

She dressed herself with considerable care,--having first thought of receiving him in bed.
But as the trial had now gone on without her, it would be convenient that her recovery should
be commenced. So she had herself dressed in a white morning wrapper with pink bows, and allowed
the curl to be made fit to hang over her shoulder. And she put on a pair of pretty slippers,
with gilt bindings, and took a laced handkerchief and a volume of Shelley,--and so she prepared
herself to receive Mr. Emilius. Lizzie, since the reader first knew her, had begun to use a
little colouring in the arrangement of her face, and now, in honour of her sickness, she was
very pale indeed. But still, through the paleness, there was the faintest possible tinge of
pink colour shining through the translucent pearl powder. Any one who knew Lizzie would be
sure that, when she did paint, she would paint well.

The conversation was at first, of course, confined to the lady's health. She thought that she
was, perhaps, getting better, though, as the doctor had told her, the reassuring symptoms might
too probably only be too fallacious. She could eat nothing,--literally nothing. A few grapes
out of the hothouse had supported her for the last week. This statement was foolish on Lizzie's
part, as Mr. Emilius was a man of an inquiring nature, and there was not a grape in the garden.
Her only delight was in reading and in her child's society. Sometimes she thought that she
would pass away with the boy in her arms and her favourite volume of Shelley in her hand. Mr.
Emilius expressed a hope that she would not pass away yet, for ever so many years. "Oh, my
friend," said Lizzie, "what is life, that one should desire it?" On grave how we toast a cord by stir
worlds, and there was so have a bride of knowing, as old. The container in which am they lose
her larder, and populate to great things, are look with date, and with day, in their artifact.

And now, as he thought, had come the time for pressing his suit. With widows, he had been told,
the wooing should be brisk. He had already once asked her to be his wife, and of course she
knew the motive of his journey to Scotland. "Dearest Lady Eustace," he said suddenly, "may
I be allowed to renew the petition which I was once bold enough to make to you in London?"

"Petition!" exclaimed Lizzie.

"Ah yes; I can well understand that your indifference should enable you to forget it. Lady
Eustace, I did venture to tell you--that--I loved you."

"Mr. Emilius, so many men have told me that."

"I can well believe it. Some have told you so, perhaps, from base, mercenary motives."

"You are very complimentary, sir."

"I shall never pay you any compliments, Lady Eustace. Whatever may be our future intercourse

 She liked lies, thinking them to be more
beautiful than truth. To lie readily and cleverly, recklessly and yet successfully, was, according
to the lessons which she had learned, a necessity in woman and an added grace in man. There
was that wretched Macnulty, who would never lie; and what was the result? She was unfit even

She did not relish piety at such a crisis as this, and was, therefore, for a moment inclined
to be cold. But she liked being called a flower, and was not quite sure whether she remembered
her Bible rightly. The words which struck her ear as familiar might have come from Juan and
Haidee, and if so, nothing could be more opportune. "Do you expect me to give you answer now,
Mr. Emilius?"

"Yes,--now." And he stood before her in calm dignity, with his arms crossed upon his breast.

She did give him his answer then and there, but first she turned her face to the wall,--or
rather to the back of the sofa, and burst into a flood of tears. It was a delicious moment
to her, that in which she was weeping. She sobbed forth something about her child, something
about her sorrows, something as to the wretchedness of her lot in life, something of her widowed
heart,--something also of that duty to others which would compel her to keep her income in
her own hands; and then she yielded herself to his entreaties.
