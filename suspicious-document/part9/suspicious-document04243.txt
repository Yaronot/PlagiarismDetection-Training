At dinner time the conversation was still about the murder. It had been committed after Mary
Lowther had left Bullhampton; but she had heard all the details, and was now as able to be
interested about it as were the others. It was Gilmore's opinion that, instead of proceeding
against Sam, they would put him into the witness-box and make him tell what he knew about the
presence of the other two men. Fenwick declared that, if they did so, such was Sam's obstinacy
that he would tell nothing. It was his own idea,--as he had explained both to his wife and
to Gilmore,--that Carry Brattle could give more evidence respecting the murder than her brother.
Of this he said nothing at present, but he had informed Constable Toffy that if Caroline Brattle
were wanted for the examination she would be found at the house of Mrs. Stiggs.

Thus for an hour or two the peculiar awkwardness of the meeting between Harry Gilmore and Mary
was removed. He was enabled to talk with energy on a matter of interest, and she could join
the conversation. But when they were round the tea-table it seemed to be arranged by common
consent that Trumbull's murder and the Brattles should, for a while, be laid aside. Then Mary
became silent and Gilmore became awkward. When inquiries were made as to Miss Marrable, he
did not know whether to seem to claim, or not to claim, that lady's acquaintance. He could
not, of course, allude to his visit to Loring, and yet he could hardly save himself from having
to acknowledge that he had been there. However, the hour wore itself away, and he was allowed
to take his departure.

During the next two days he did not see Mary Lowthcr. On the Friday he met her with Mrs. Fenwick
as the two were returning from the mill. They had gone to visit Mrs. Brattle and Fanny, and
to administer such comfort as was possible in the present circumstances. The poor woman told
them that the father was now as silent about his son as about his daughter, but that he had
himself gone over to Heytesbury to secure legal advice for the lad, and to learn from Mr. Jones,
the attorney, what might be the true aspect of the case. Of what he had learned he had told
nothing to the women at the mill, but the two ladies had expressed their strong opinion of
Sam's innocence. All this was narrated by Mrs. Fenwick to Gilmore, and Mary Lowther was enabled
to take her part in the narrative. The Squire was walking between the two, and it seemed to
him as he walked that Mary at least had no desire to avoid him. He became high in hope, and
began to wish that even now, at this moment, he might be left alone with her and might learn
his fate. He parted from them when they were near the village, and as he went he held Mary's
hand within his own for a few moments. There was no return of his pressure, but it seemed to
him that her hand was left with him almost willingly.

"What do you think of him?" her friend said to her, as soon as he had parted from them.

"What do I think of him? I have always thought well of him."

"I know you have; to think otherwise of one who is positively so good would be impossible.
But do you feel more kindly to him than you used?"

"Janet," said Mary, after pausing awhile, "you had better leave me alone. Don't be angry with
me; but really it will be better that you should leave me alone."

"I won't be angry with you, and I will leave you alone," said Mrs. Fenwick. And, as she considered
this request afterwards, it seemed to her that the very making of such a request implied a
determination on the girl's part to bring herself to accept the man's offer,--if it might be
possible.

CHAPTER XLIX.

MARY LOWTHER'S DOOM.

The police were so very tedious in managing their business, and the whole affair of the second
magisterial investigation was so protracted, that people in the neighbourhood became almost
tired of it, in spite of that appetite for excitement which the ordinary quiet life of a rural
district produces. On the first Tuesday in June Sam had surrendered himself at Heytesbury,
and on the second Tuesday it was understood that the production of the prisoners was only formal.
The final examination, and committal, if the evidence should be sufficient, was to take place
on the third Tuesday in the month. Against this Mr. Jones had remonstrated very loudly on Sam's
behalf, protesting that the magistrates were going beyond their power in locking up a man against
whom there was no more evidence now than there had been when before they had found themselves
compelled to release him on bail. But this was of no avail. Sam had been released before because
the men who were supposed to have been his accomplices were not in custody; and now that they
were in custody the police declared it to be out of the question that he should be left at
large. The magistrates of course agreed with the police, in spite of the indignation of Mr.
Jones. In the meantime a subpoena was served upon Carry Brattle to appear on that final Tuesday,--Tuesday
the nineteenth of June. The policeman, when he served her with the paper, told her that on
the morning in question he would come and fetch her. The poor girl said not a word as she took
into her hand the dreadful document. Mrs. Stiggs asked a question or two of the man, but got
from him no information. But it was well known in Trotter's Buildings, and round about the
Three Honest Men, that Sam Brattle was to be tried for the murder of Mr. Trumbull, and public
opinion in that part of Salisbury was adverse to Sam. Public opinion was averse, also, to poor
Carry; and Mrs. Stiggs was becoming almost tired of her lodger, although the payment made for
her was not ungenerous and was as punctual as the sun. In truth, the tongue of the landlady
of the Three Honest Men was potential in those parts, and was very bitter against Sam and his
sister.

In the meantime there was a matter of interest which, to our friends at Bullhampton, exceeded
even that of the Heytesbury examinations. Mr. Gilmore was now daily at the vicarage on some
new or old lover's pretence. It might be that he stood but for a minute or two on the terrace
outside the drawing-room windows, or that he would sit with the ladies during half the afternoon,
or that he would come down to dinner,--some excuse having arisen for an invitation to that
effect during the morning. Very little was said on the subject between Mrs. Fenwick and Mary
Lowther, and not a word between the Vicar and his guest; but between Mr. and Mrs. Fenwick many
words were spoken, and before the first week was over they were sure that she would yield.

"I think she will," said Mrs. Fenwick;--"but she will do it in agony."

"Then if I were Harry I would leave her alone," said the Vicar.

"But you are not Harry; and if you were, you would be wrong. She will not be happy when she
accepts him; but by the time the day fixed for the wedding comes round, she will have reconciled
herself to it, and then she will be as loving a wife as ever a man had." But the Vicar shook
his head and said that, so far as he was concerned, love of that sort would not have sufficed
for him.

"Of course," said his wife, "it is very pleasant for a man to be told that the woman he loves
is dying for him; but men can't always have everything that they want."

Mary Lowther at this time became subject to a feeling of shame which almost overwhelmed her.
There grew upon her a consciousness that she had allowed herself to come to Bullhampton on
purpose that she might receive a renewed offer of marriage from her old lover, and that she
had done so because her new and favoured lover had left her. Of course she must accept Mr.
Gilmore. Of that she had now become quite sure. She had come to Bullhampton,--so she now told
herself,--because she had been taught to believe that it would not be right for her to abandon
herself to a mode of life which was not to her taste. All the friends in whose judgment she
could confide expressed to her in every possible way their desire that she should marry this
man; and now she had made this journey with the view of following their counsel. So she thought
of herself and her doings; but such was not in truth the case. When she first determined to
visit Bullhampton, she was very far from thinking that she would accept the man. Mrs. Fenwick's
argument that she should not be kept away from Bullhampton by fear of Mr. Gilmore, had prevailed
with her,--and she had come. And now that she was there, and that this man was daily with her,
it was no longer possible that she should refuse him. And, after all, what did it matter? She
was becoming sick of the importance which she imputed to herself in thinking of herself. If
she could make the man happy why should she not do so? The romance of her life had become to
her a rhodomontade of which she was ashamed. What was her love, that she should think so much
about it? What did it mean? Could she not do her duty in the position in life in which her
friends wished to place her, without hankering after a something which was not to be bestowed
on her? After all, what did it all matter? She would tell the man the exact truth as well as
she knew how to tell it, and then let him take her or leave her as he listed.

And she did tell him the truth, after the following fashion. It came to pass at last that a
day and an hour was fixed in which Mr. Gilmore might come to the vicarage and find Mary alone.
There were no absolute words arranging this to which she was a party, but it was understood.
She did not even pretend an unwillingness to receive him, and had assented by silence when
Mrs. Fenwick had said that the man should be put out of his suspense. Mary, when she was silent,
knew well that it was no longer within her power to refuse him.

He came and found her alone. He knew, too, or fancied that he knew, what would be the result
of the interview. She would accept him, without protestations of violent love for himself,
acknowledging what had passed between her and her cousin, and proffering to him the offer of
future affection. He had pictured it all to himself, and knew that he intended to accept what
would be tendered. There were drawbacks in the happiness which was in store for him, but still
he would take what he could get. As each so nearly understood the purpose of the other it was
almost a pity that the arrangement could not be made without any words between them,--words
which could hardly be pleasant either in the speaking or in the hearing.

He had determined that he would disembarrass himself of all preliminary flourishes in addressing
her, and had his speech ready as he took her by the hand. "Mary," he said, "you know why I
am here." Of course she made no reply. "I told you when I first saw you again that I was unchanged."
Then he paused, as though he expected that she would answer him, but still she said nothing.
"Indeed I am unchanged. When you were here before I told you that I could look forward to no
happiness unless you would consent to be my wife. That was nearly a year ago, and I have come
again now to tell you the same thing. I do not think but what you will believe me to be in
earnest."

"I know that you are in earnest," she said.

"No man was ever more so. My constancy has been tried during the time that you have been away.
I do not say so as a reproach to you. Of course there can be no reproach. I have nothing to
complain of in your conduct to me. But I think I may say that if my regard for you has outlived
the pain of those months there is some evidence that it is sincere."

"I have never doubted your sincerity."

"Nor can you doubt my constancy."

"Except in this, that it is so often that we want that which we have not, and find it so little
worthy of having when we get it."

"You do not say that from your heart, Mary. If you mean to refuse me again, it is not because
you doubt the reality of my love."

"I do not mean to refuse you again, Mr. Gilmore." Then he attempted to put his arm round her
waist, but she recoiled from him, not in anger, but very quietly, and with a womanly grace
that was perfect. "But you must hear me first, before I can allow you to take me in the only
way in which I can bestow myself. I have been steeling myself to this, and I must tell you
all that has occurred since we were last together."

"I know it all," said he, anxious that she should be spared;--anxious also that he himself
should be spared the pain of hearing that which she was about to say to him.

But it was necessary for her that she should say it. She would not go to him as his accepted
mistress upon other terms than those she had already proposed to herself. "Though you know
it, I must speak of it," she said. "I should not, otherwise, be dealing honestly either with
you or with myself. Since I saw you last, I have met my cousin, Captain Marrable. I became
attached to him with a quickness which I cannot even myself understand. I loved him dearly,
and we were engaged to be married."

"You wrote to me, Mary, and told me all that." This he said, striving to hide the impatience
which he felt; but striving in vain.

"I did so, and now I have to tell you that that engagement is at an end. Circumstances occurred,--a
sad loss of income that he had expected,--which made it imperative on him, and also on me in
his behalf, that we should abandon our hopes. He would have been ruined by such a marriage,--and
it is all over." Then she paused, and he thought that she had done; but there was more to be
said, words heavier to be borne than any which she had yet uttered. "And I love him still.
I should lie if I said that it was not so. If he were free to marry me this moment I should
go to him." As she said this, there came a black cloud across his brow; but he stood silent
to hear it all to the last. "My respect and esteem for you are boundless," she continued,--"but
he has my heart. It is only because I know that I cannot be his wife that I have allowed myself
to think whether it is my duty to become the wife of another man. After what I now say to you,
I do not expect that you will persevere. Should you do so, you must give me time." Then she
paused, as though it were now his turn to speak; but there was something further that she felt
herself bound to say, and, as he was still silent, she continued. "My friends,--those whom
I most trust in the world, my aunt and Janet Fenwick, all tell me that it will be best for
me to accept your offer. I have made no promise to either of them. I would tell my mind to
no one till I told it to you. I believe I owe as much to you,--almost as much as a woman can
owe to a man; but still, were my cousin so placed that he could afford to marry a poor wife,
I should leave you and go to him at once. I have told you everything now; and if, after this,
you can think me worth having, I can only promise that I will endeavour, at some future time,
to do my duty to you as your wife." Then she had finished, and she stood before him--waiting
her doom.

 Mrs. Stiggs acknowledged that had she
seen the girl going forth thus provided, her suspicions would have been aroused; but Carry
had managed to leave the house without being observed. Then the constable went on to say that
Mrs. Stiggs had told him that she had been sure that Carry would go. "I've been a waiting for
it all along," she had said; "but when there came the law rumpus atop of the other, I knew
as how she'd hop the twig." And now Carry Brattle had hopped the twig, and no one knew whither
she had gone. There was much sorrow at the vicarage; for Mrs. Fenwick, though she had been
obliged to restrain her husband's impetuosity in the matter, had nevertheless wished well for
the poor girl;--and who could not believe aught of her now but that she would return to misery
and degradation? When the constable was interrogated as to the need for her attendance on the
morrow, he declared that nothing could now be done towards finding her and bringing her to
Heytesbury in time for the magistrates' session. He supposed there would be another remand,
and that then she, too, would be--wanted.

But there had been so many remands that on the Tuesday the magistrates were determined to commit
the men, and did commit two of them. Against Sam there was no tittle of evidence, except as
to that fact that he had been seen with these men in Mr. Fenwick's garden; and it was at once
proposed to put him into the witness-box, instead of proceeding against him as one of the murderers.
As a witness he was adjudged to have behaved badly; but the assumed independence of his demeanour
was probably the worst of his misbehaviour. He would tell them nothing of the circumstances
of the murder, except that having previously become acquainted with the two men, Burrows and
Acorn, and having, as he thought, a spite against the Vicar at the time, he had determined
to make free with some of the vicarage fruit. He had, he said, met the men in the village that
afternoon, and had no knowledge of their business there. He had known Acorn more intimately
than the other man, and confessed at last that his acquaintance with that man had arisen from
a belief that Acorn was about to marry his sister. He acknowledged that he knew that Burrows
had been a convicted thief, and that Acorn had been punished for horse stealing. When he was
asked how it had come to pass that he was desirous of seeing his sister married to a horse-stealer,
he declined to answer, and, looking round the Court, said that he hoped there was no man there
who would be coward enough to say anything against his sister. They who heard him declared
that there was more of a threat than a request expressed in his words and manner.

A question was put to him as to his knowledge of Farmer Trumbull's money. "There was them as
knew; but I knew nothing," he said. He was pressed on this point by the magistrates, but would
say not a word further. As to this, however, the police were indifferent, as they believed
that they would be able to prove at the trial, from other sources, that the mother of the man
called the Grinder had certainly received tidings of the farmer's wealth. There were many small
matters of evidence to which the magistrates trusted. One of the men had bought poison, and
the dog had been poisoned. The presence of the cart at the farmer's gate was proved, and the
subsequent presence of the two men in the same cart at Pycroft Common. The size of the footprints,
the characters and subsequent flight of the men, and certain damaging denials and admissions
which they themselves had made, all went to make up the case against them, and they were committed
to be tried for the murder. Sam, however, was allowed to go free, being served, however, with
a subpoena to attend at the trial as a witness. "I will," said he, "if you send me down money
enough to bring me up from South Shields, and take me back again. I ain't a coming on my own
hook as I did this time;--and wouldn't now, only for Muster Fenwick." Our friends left the
police to settle this question with Sam, and then drove home to Bullhampton.

The Vicar was triumphant, though his triumph was somewhat quelled by the disappearance of Carry
Brattle. There could, however, be no longer any doubt that Sam Brattle's innocence as to the
murder was established. Head-Constable Toffy had himself acknowledged to him that Sam could
have had no hand in it. "I told you so from the beginning," said the Vicar. "We 'as got the
right uns, at any rate," said the constable; "and it wasn't none of our fault that we hadn't
'em before." But though Constable Toffy was thus honest, there were one or two in Heytesbury
on that day who still persisted in declaring that Sam was one of the murderers. Sir Thomas
Charleys stuck to that opinion to the last; and Lord Trowbridge, who had again sat upon the
bench, was quite convinced that justice was being shamefully robbed of her due.

When the Vicar reached Bullhampton, instead of turning into his own place at once, he drove
himself on to the mill. He dropped Gilmore at the gate, but he could not bear that the father
and mother should not know immediately, from a source which they would trust, that Sam had
been declared innocent of that great offence. Driving round by the road, Fenwick met the miller
about a quarter of a mile from his own house. "Mr. Brattle," he said, "they have committed
the two men."

"Have they, sir?" said the miller, not condescending to ask a question about his own son.

"As I have said all along, Sam had no more to do with it than you or I."

"You have been very good, Muster Fenwick."

"Come, Mr. Brattle, do not pretend that this is not a comfort to you."

"A comfort as my son ain't proved a murderer! If they'd a hanged 'im, Muster Fenwick, that'd
a been bad, for certain. It ain't much of comfort we has; but there may be a better and a worser
in everything, no doubt. I'm obleeged to you, all as one, Muster Fenwick--very much obleeged;
and it will take a heavy load off his mother's heart." Then the Vicar turned his gig round,
and drove himself home.

CHAPTER LII.

CARRY BRATTLE'S JOURNEY.

Mrs. Stiggs had been right in her surmise about Carry Brattle. The confinement in Trotter's
Buildings and want of interest in her life was more than the girl could bear, and she had been
thinking of escape almost from the first day that she had been there. Had it not been for the
mingled fear and love with which she regarded Mr. Fenwick, had she not dreaded that he should
think her ungrateful, she would have flown even before the summons came to her which told her
that she must appear before the magistrates and lawyers, and among a crowd of people, in the
neighbourhood of her old home. That she could not endure, and therefore she had flown. When
it had been suggested to her that she should go and live with her brother's wife as her servant,
that idea had been hard to bear. But there had been uncertainty, and an opinion of her own
which proved to be right, that her sister-in-law would not receive her. Now about this paper
that the policeman had handed to her, and the threatened journey to Heytesbury, there was no
uncertainty,--unless she might possibly escape the evil by running away. Therefore she ran away.

The straight-going people of the world, in dealing with those who go crooked, are almost always
unreasonable. "Because you have been bad," say they who are not bad to those who are bad, "because
you have hitherto indulged yourself with all pleasures within your reach, because you have
never worked steadily or submitted yourself to restraint, because you have been a drunkard,
and a gambler, and have lived in foul company, therefore now,--now that I have got a hold of
you and can manipulate you in reference to your repentance and future conduct,--I will require
from you a mode of life that, in its general attractions, shall be about equal to that of a
hermit in the desert. If you flinch you are not only a monster of ingratitude towards me, who
am taking all this trouble to save you, but you are also a poor wretch for whom no possible
hope of grace can remain." When it is found that a young man is neglecting his duties, doing
nothing, spending his nights in billiard rooms and worse places, and getting up at two o'clock
in the day, the usual prescription of his friends is that he should lock himself up in his
own dingy room, drink tea, and spend his hours in reading good books. It is hardly recognised
that a sudden change from billiards to good books requires a strength of character which, if
possessed, would probably have kept the young man altogether from falling into bad habits.
If we left the doors of our prisons open, and then expressed disgust because the prisoners
walked out, we should hardly be less rational. The hours at Mrs. Stiggs's house had been frightfully
heavy to poor Carry Brattle, and at last she escaped.

It was half-past ten on the Monday morning when she went out. It was her custom to go out at
that hour. Mr. Fenwick had desired her to attend the morning services at the Cathedral. She
had done so for a day or two, and had then neglected them. But she had still left the house
always at that time; and once, when Mrs. Stiggs had asked some question on the subject, she
had replied almost in anger that she was not a prisoner. On this occasion she made changes
in her dress which were not usual, and therefore she was careful to avoid being seen as she
went; but had she been interrogated she would have persevered. Who had a right to stop her?

But where should she go? The reader may perhaps remember that once when Mr. Fenwick first found
this poor girl, after her flight from home and her great disgrace, she had expressed a desire
to go to the mill and just look at it,--even if she might do no more than that. The same idea
was now in her mind, but as she left the city she had no concerted plan. There were two things
between which she must choose at once,--either to go to London, or not to go to London. She
had money enough for her fare, and perhaps a few shillings over. In a dim way she did understand
that the choice was between going to the devil at once,--and not going quite at once; and then,
weakly, wistfully, with uncertain step, almost without an operation of her mind, she did not
take the turn which, from the end of Trotter's Buildings, would have brought her to the Railway
Station, but did take that which led her by the Three Honest Men out on to the Devizes road,--the
road which passes across Salisbury Plain, and leads from the city to many Wiltshire villages,--of
which Bullhampton is one.

She walked slowly, but she walked nearly the whole day. Nothing could be more truly tragical
than the utterly purposeless tenour of her day,--and of her whole life. She had no plan,--nothing
before her; no object even for the evening and night of that very day in which she was wasting
her strength on the Devizes road. It is the lack of object, of all aim, in the lives of the
houseless wanderers that gives to them the most terrible element of their misery. Think of
it! To walk forth with, say, ten shillings in your pocket,--so that there need be no instant
suffering from want of bread or shelter,--and have no work to do, no friend to see, no place
to expect you, no duty to accomplish, no hope to follow, no bourn to which you can draw nigher,--except
that bourn which, in such circumstances, the traveller must surely regard as simply the end
of his weariness! But there is nothing to which humanity cannot attune itself. Men can live
upon poison, can learn to endure absolute solitude, can bear contumely, scorn, and shame, and
never show it. Carry Brattle had already become accustomed to misery, and as she walked she
thought more of the wretchedness of the present hour, of her weary feet, of her hunger, and
of the nature of the rest which she might purchase for herself at some poor wayside inn, than
she did of her future life.

She got a lump of bread and a glass of beer in the middle of the day, and then she walked on
and on till the evening came. She went very slowly, stopping often and sitting down when the
road side would afford her some spot of green shade. At eight o'clock she had walked fifteen
miles, straight along the road, and, as she knew well, had passed the turn which would have
taken her by the nearest way from Salisbury to Bullhampton. She had formed no plan, but entertained
a hope that if she continued to walk they would not catch her so as to take her to Heytesbury
on the morrow. She knew that if she went on she might get to Pycroft Common by this road; and
though there was no one in the whole world whom she hated worse than Mrs. Burrows, still at
Pycroft Common she might probably be taken in and sheltered. At eight she reached a small village
which she remembered to have seen before, of which she saw the name written up on a board,
and which she knew to be six miles from Bullhampton. She was so tired and weary that she could
go no further, and here she asked for a bed. She told them that she was walking from Salisbury
to the house of a friend who lived near Devizes, and that she had thought she could do it in
one day and save her railway fare. She was simply asked to pay for her bed and supper beforehand,
and then she was taken in and fed and sheltered. On the next morning she got up very late and
was unwilling to leave the house. She paid for her breakfast, and, as she was not told to go
her way, she sat on the chair in which she had been placed, without speaking, almost without
moving, till late in the afternoon. At three o'clock she roused herself, asked for some bread
and cheese which she put in her pocket, and started again upon her journey. She thought that
she would be safe, at any rate for that day, from the magistrates and the policemen, from the
sight of her brother, and from the presence of that other man at Heytesbury. But whither she
would go when she left the house,--whether on to the hated cottage at Pycroft Common, or to
her father's house, she had not made up her mind when she tied on her hat. She went on along
the road towards Devizes, and about two miles from the village she came to a lane turning to
the left, with a finger-post. On this was written a direction,--To Bullhampton and Imber; and
here she turned short off towards the parish in which she had been born. It was then four o'clock,
and when she had travelled a mile further she found a nook under the wall of a little bridge,
and there she seated herself, and ate her dinner of bread and cheese. While she was there a
policeman on foot passed along the road. The man did not see her, and had he seen her would
have taken no more than a policeman's ordinary notice of her; but she saw him, and in consequence
did not leave her hiding-place for hours.

About nine o'clock she crept on again, but even then her mind was not made up. She did not
even yet know where she would bestow herself for that night. It seemed to her that there would
be an inexpressible pleasure to her, even in her misery, in walking round the precincts of
the mill, in gazing at the windows of the house, in standing on the bridge where she had so
often loitered, and in looking once more on the scene of her childhood. But, as she thought
of this, she remembered the darkness of the stream, and the softly-gurgling but rapid flow
with which it hurried itself on beneath the black abyss of the building. She had often shuddered
as she watched it, indulging herself in the luxury of causeless trepidation. But now, were
she there, she would surely take that plunge into the blackness, which would bring her to the
end of all her misery!

And yet, as she went on towards her old home, through the twilight, she had no more definite
idea than that of looking once more on the place which had been cherished in her memory through
all her sufferings. As to her rest for the night she had no plan,--unless, indeed, she might
find her rest in the hidden mill-pool of that dark, softly-gurgling stream.

On that same day, between six and seven in the evening, the miller was told by Mr. Fenwick
that his son was no longer accused of the murder. He had not received the information in the
most gracious manner; but not the less quick was he in making it known at the mill. "Them dunderheads
over at He'tsbry has found out at last as our Sam had now't to do with it." This he said, addressing
no one in particular, but in the hearing of his wife and Fanny Brattle. Then there came upon
him a torrent of questions and a torrent also of tears. Mrs. Brattle and Fanny had both made
up their minds that Sam was innocent; but the mother had still feared that he would be made
to suffer in spite of his innocence. Fanny, however, had always persisted that the goodness
of the Lord would save him and them from such injustice. To the old man himself they had hardly
dared to talk about it, but now they strove to win him to some softness. Might not a struggle
be made to bring Sam back to the mill? But it was very hard to soften the miller. "After what's
come and gone, the lad is better away," he said, at last. "I didn't think as he'd ever raised
his hand again an old man," he said, shortly afterwards; "but he's kep' company with them as
did. It's a'most as bad." Beyond this the miller would not go; but, when they separated for
the night, the mother took herself for awhile into the daughter's chamber in order that they
might weep and rejoice together. It was now all but midsummer, and the evenings were long and
sultry. The window of Fanny's bedroom looked out on to the garden of the mill, and was but
a foot or two above the ground. This ground had once been pleasant to them all, and profitable
withal. Of late, since the miller had become old, and Sam had grown to be too restive and self-willed
to act as desired for the general welfare of the family, but little of pleasure, or profit
either, had been forthcoming from the patch of ground. There were a few cabbages there, and
rows of untended gooseberry and currant bushes, and down towards the orchard there was a patch
of potatoes; but no one took pride now in the garden. As for Fanny, if she could provide that
there should always be a sufficient meal on the table for her father and mother, it was as
much as she could do. The days were clean gone by in which she had had time and spirits to
tend her roses, pinks, and pansies. Now she sat at the open window with her mother, and with
bated breath they spoke of the daughter and sister that was lost to them.

"He wouldn't take it amiss, mother, if I was to go over to Salisbury?"

"If you was to ask him, Fan, he'd bid you not," said the mother.

"But I wouldn't ask him. I wouldn't tell him till I was back. She was to be before the magistrates
to-day. Mr. Fenwick told me so on Sunday."

"It will about be the death of her."

"I don't know, mother. She's bolder now, mother, I fear, than what she was in old days. And
she was always sprightly,--speaking up to the quality, with no fear like. Maybe it was what
she said that got them to let Sam go. She was never a coward, such as me."

"Oh, Fan, if she'd only a taken after thee!"

"The Lord, mother, makes us different for purposes of his own. Of all the lasses I ever see,
to my eyes she was the comeliest." The old woman couldn't speak now, but rubbed her moist cheeks
with her raised apron. "I'll ask Mr. Toffy to-morrow, mother," continued Fanny, "and if she
be still at that place in Salisbury where Mr. Fenwick put her, I'll just go to her. Father
won't turn me out of the house along of it."

"Turn thee out, Fan! He'll never turn thee out. What 'd a do, or what 'd I do if thee was to
go away from us? If thou dost go, Fan, take her a few bits of things that are lying there in
the big press, and 'll never be used other gait. I warrant the poor child 'll be but badly
off for under-clothing."

And then they planned how the journey on the morrow should be made,--after the constable should
have been questioned, and the Vicar should have been consulted. Fanny would leave home immediately
after breakfast, and when the miller should ask after her at dinner his wife should tell him
that his daughter had gone to Salisbury. If further question should be asked,--and it was thought
possible that no further question would be asked, as the father would then guess the errand
on which his daughter would have gone,--but if the subject were further mooted, Mrs. Brattle,
with such courage as she might be able to assume, should acknowledge the business that had
taken Fanny to Salisbury. Then there arose questions about money. Mr. Fenwick had owned, thinking
that he might thereby ease the mother's heart, that for the present Carry was maintained by
him. To take this task upon themselves the mother and daughter were unable. The money which
they had in hand, very small in amount, was, they knew, the property of the head of the family.
That they could do no permanent good to Carry was a great grief. But it might be something
if they could comfort her for awhile.

"I don't think but what her heart 'll still be soft to thee, Fan; and who knows but what it
may bring her round to see thy face, and hear thy voice."

At that moment Fanny heard a sound in the garden, and stretched her head and shoulders quickly
out of the window. They had been late at the mill that evening, and it was now eleven o'clock.
It had been still daylight when the miller had left them at tea; but the night had crept on
them as they had sat there. There was no moon, but there was still something left of the reflection
of the last colours of the setting sun, and the night was by no means dark. Fanny saw at once
the figure of a woman, though she did not at once recognise the person of her sister. "Oh,
mother! oh, mother! oh, mother!" said a voice from the night; and in a moment Carry Brattle
had stretched herself so far within the window that she had grasped her mother by the arm.

CHAPTER LIII.

THE FATTED CALF.

Mrs. Brattle, when she heard her daughter's voice, was so confounded, dismayed, and frightened,
that for awhile she could give no direction as to what should be done. She had screamed at
first, having some dim idea in her mind that the form she saw was not of living flesh and blood.
And Carry herself had been hardly more composed or mistress of herself than her mother. She
had strayed thither, never having quite made up her mind to any settled purpose. From the spot
in which she had hidden herself under the bridge when the policeman passed her she had started
when the evening sun was setting, and had wandered on slowly till the old familiar landmarks
of the parish were reached. And then she came to the river, and looking across could just see
the eaves of the mill through the willows by the last gloaming of the sunlight. Then she stood
and paused, and every now and again had crept on a few feet as her courage came to her, and
at last, by the well known little path, she had crept down behind the mill, crossing the stream
by the board which had once been so accustomed to her feet, and had made her way into the garden
and had heard her mother and sister as they talked together at the open window. Any idea which
she had hitherto entertained of not making herself known to them at the mill,--of not making
herself known at any rate to her mother and sister,--left her at once at that moment. There
had been upon her a waking dream, a horrid dream, that the waters of the mill-stream might
flow over her head, and hide her wickedness and her misery from the eyes of men; and she had
stood and shuddered as she saw the river; but she had never really thought that her own strength
would suffice for that termination to her sorrows. It was more probable that she would be doomed
to lie during the night beneath a hedge, and then perish of the morning cold! But now, as she
heard the voices at the window, there could be no choice for her but that she should make herself
known,--not though her father should kill her.

Even Fanny was driven beyond the strength of her composure by the strangeness of this advent.
"Carry! Carry!" she exclaimed over and over again, not aloud,--and indeed her voice was never
loud,--but with bated wonder. The two sisters held each other by the hand, and Carry's other
hand still grasped her mother's arm. "Oh, mother, I am so tired," said the girl. "Oh, mother,
I think that I shall die."

"My child;--my poor child. What shall we do, Fan?"

"Bring her in, of course," said Fanny.

"But your father--"

"We couldn't turn her away from the very window, and she like that, mother."

"Don't turn me away, Fanny. Dear Fanny, do not turn me away," said Carry, striving to take
her sister by the other hand.

"No, Carry, we will not," said Fanny, trying to settle her mind to some plan of action. Any
idea of keeping the thing long secret from her father she knew that she could not entertain;
but for this night she resolved at last that shelter should be given to the discarded daughter
without the father's knowledge. But even in doing this there would be difficulty. Carry must
be brought in through the window, as any disturbance at the front of the house would arouse
the miller. And then Mrs. Brattle must be made to go to her own room, or her absence would
create suspicion and confusion. Fanny, too, had terrible doubts as to her mother's powers of
going to her bed and lying there without revealing to her husband that some cause of great
excitement had arisen. And then it might be that the miller would come to his daughter's room,
and insist that the outcast should be made an outcast again, even in the middle of the night.
He was a man so stern, so obstinate, so unforgiving, so masterful, that Fanny, though she would
face any danger as regarded herself, knew that terrible things might happen. It seemed to her
that Carry was very weak. If their father came to them in his wrath, might she not die in her
despair? Nevertheless it was necessary that something should be done. "We must let her get
in at the window, mother," she said. "It won't do, nohow, to unbar the door."

"But what if he was to kill her outright! Oh, Carry; oh, my child. I dunna know as she can
get in along of her weakness." But Carry was not so tired as that. She had been in and out
of that window scores of times; and now, when she heard that the permission was accorded to
her, she was not long before she was in her mother's arms. "My own Carry, my own bairn;--my
girl, my darling." And the poor mother satisfied the longings of her heart with infinite caresses.

Fanny in the meantime had crept out to the kitchen, and now returned with food in a plate and
cold tea. "My girl," she said, "you must eat a bit, and then we will have you to bed. When
the morn comes, we must think about it."

"Fanny, you was always the best that there ever was," said Carry, speaking from her mother's bosom.

"And now, mother," continued Fanny, "you must creep off. Indeed you must, or of course father'll
wake up. And mother, don't say a word to-morrow when he rises. I'll go to him in the mill myself.
That'll be best." Then, with longings that could hardly be repressed, with warm, thick, clinging
kisses, with a hot, rapid, repeated assurance that everything,--everything had been forgiven,
that her own Carry was once more her own, own Carry, the poor mother allowed herself to be
banished. There seemed to her to be such a world of cruelty in the fact that Fanny might remain
for the whole of that night with the dear one who had returned to them, while she must be sent
away,--perhaps not to see her again if the storm in the morning should rise too loudly! Fanny,
with great craft, accompanied her mother to her room, so that if the old man should speak she
might be there to answer;--but the miller slept soundly after his day of labour, and never stirred.

"What will he do to me, Fan?" the wanderer asked as soon as her sister returned.

"Don't think of it now, my pet," said Fanny, softened almost as her mother was softened by
the sight of her sister.

"Will he kill me, Fan?"

"No, dear; he will not lay a hand upon you. It is his words that are so rough! Carry, Carry,
will you be good?"

"I will, dear; indeed I will. I have not been bad since Mr. Fenwick came."

"My sister,--if you will be good, I will never leave you. My heart's darling, my beauty, my
pretty one! Carry, you shall be the same to me as always, if you'll be good. I'll never cast
it up again you, if you'll be good." Then she, too, filled herself full, and satisfied the
hungry craving of her love with the warmth of her caresses. "But thee'll be famished, lass.
I'll see thee eat a bit, and then I'll put thee comfortable to bed."

Poor Carry Brattle was famished, and ate the bread and bacon which were set before her, and
drank the cold tea, with an appetite which was perhaps unbecoming the romance of her position.
Her sister stood over her, cutting a slice now and then from the loaf, telling her that she
had taken nothing, smoothing her hair, and wishing for her sake that the fire were better.
"I'm afeard of father, Fan,--awfully; but for all that, it's the sweetest meal as I've had
since I left the mill." Then Fanny was on her knees beside the returned profligate, covering
even the dear one's garments with her kisses.

It was late before Fanny laid herself down by her sister's side that night. "Carry," she whispered
when her sister was undressed, "will you kneel here and say your prayers as you used to?" Carry,
without a word, did as she was bidden, and hid her face upon her hands in her sister's lap.
No word was spoken out loud, but Fanny was satisfied that her sister had been in earnest. "Now
sleep, my darling;--and when I've just tidied your things for the morning, I will be with you."
The wanderer again obeyed, and in a few moments the work of the past two days befriended her,
and she was asleep. Then the sister went to her task with the soiled frock and the soiled shoes,
and looked up things clean and decent for the morrow. It would be at any rate well that Carry
should appear before her father without the stain of the road upon her.

As the lost one lay asleep there, with her soft ringlets all loose upon the pillow, still beautiful,
still soft, lovely though an outcast from the dearest rights of womanhood, with so much of
innocence on her brow, with so much left of the grace of childhood though the glory of the
flower had been destroyed by the unworthy hand that had ravished its sweetness, Fanny, sitting
in the corner of the room over her work, with her eye from moment to moment turned upon the
sleeper, could not keep her mind from wandering away in thoughts on the strange destiny of
woman. She knew that there had been moments in her life in which her great love for her sister
had been tinged with envy. No young lad had ever waited in the dusk to hear the sound of her
footfall; no half-impudent but half-bashful glances had ever been thrown after her as she went
through the village on her business. To be a homely, household thing, useful indeed in this
world, and with high hopes for the future,--but still to be a drudge; that had been her destiny.
There was never a woman to whom the idea of being loved was not the sweetest thought that her
mind could produce. Fate had made her plain, and no man had loved her. The same chance had
made Carry pretty,--the belle of the village, the acknowledged beauty of Bullhampton. And there
she lay, a thing said to be so foul that even a father could not endure to have her name mentioned
in his ears! And yet, how small had been her fault compared with other crimes for which men
and women are forgiven speedily, even if it has been held that pardon has ever been required.

She came over, and knelt down and kissed her sister on her brow; and as she did so she swore
to herself that by her, even in the inmost recesses of her bosom, Carry should never be held
to be evil, to be a castaway, to be one of whom, as her sister, it would behove her to be ashamed.
She had told Carry that she would "never cast it up against her." She now resolved that there
should be no such casting up even in her own judgment. Had she, too, been fair, might not she
also have fallen?

At five o'clock on the following morning the miller went out from the house to his mill, according
to his daily practice. Fanny heard his heavy step, heard the bar withdrawn, heard the shutters
removed from the kitchen window, and knew that her father was as yet in ignorance of the inmate
who had been harboured. Fanny at once arose from her bed, careful not to disturb her companion.
She had thought it all out, whether she would have Carry ready dressed for an escape, should
it be that her father would demand imperiously that she should be sent adrift from the mill,
or whether it might not be better that she should be able to plead at the first moment that
her sister was in bed, tired, asleep,--at any rate undressed,--and that some little time must
be allowed. Might it not be that even in that hour her father's heart might be softened? But
she must lose no time in going to him. The hired man who now tended the mill with her father
came always at six, and that which she had to say to him must be said with no ear to hear her
but his own. It would have been impossible even for her to remind him of his daughter before
a stranger. She slipped her clothes on, therefore, and within ten minutes of her father's departure
followed him into the mill.

The old man had gone aloft, and she heard his slow, heavy feet as he was moving the sacks which
were above her head. She considered for a moment, and thinking it better that she should not
herself ascend the little ladder,--knowing that it might be well that she should have the power
of instant retreat to the house,--she called to him from below. "What's wanted now?" demanded
the old man as soon as he heard her. "Father, I must speak to you," she said. "Father, you
must come down to me." Then he came down slowly, without a word, and stood before her waiting
to hear her tidings. "Father," she said, "there is some one in the house, and I have come to
tell you."

"Sam has come, then?" said he; and she could see that there was a sparkle of joy in his eye
as he spoke. Oh, if she could only make the return of that other child as grateful to him as
would have been the return of his son!

"No, father; it isn't Sam."

"Who be it, then?" The tone of his voice, and the colour and bearing of his face were changed
as he asked the question. She saw at once that he had guessed the truth. "It isn't--it isn't--?"

"Yes, father; it is Carry." As she spoke she came close to him, and strove to take his hand;
but he thrust both his hands into his pockets and turned himself half away from her. "Father,
she is our flesh and blood; you will not turn against her now that she has come back to us,
and is sorry for her faults."

"She is a--" But his other daughter had stopped his mouth with her hand before the word had
been uttered.

"Father, who among us has not done wrong at times?"

"She has disgraced my gray hairs, and made me a reproach and a shame. I will not see her. Bid
her begone. I will not speak to her or look at her. How came she there? When did she come?"

Then Fanny told her father the whole story,--everything as it occurred, and did not forget
to add her own conviction that Carry's life had been decent in all respects since the Vicar
had found a home for her in Salisbury. "You would not have it go on like that, father. She
is naught to our parson."

"I will pay. As long as there is a shilling left, I will pay for her. She shall not live on
the charity of any man, whether parson or no parson. But I will not see her. While she be here
you may just send me my vittels to the mill. If she be not gone afore night, I will sleep here
among the sacks."

She stayed with him till the labourer came, and then she returned to the house, having failed
as yet to touch his heart. England was near for period before it. "" godhead, be not you had disturb;

   Nothing can be kinder than Sir Gregory, in his sort of
   fashion. Gregory Marrable, the son, is, I fear, in a
   bad way. He is unlike his father, and laughs at his own
   ailments, but everybody in the house,--except perhaps Sir
   Gregory,--knows that he is very ill. He never comes down
   at all now, but lives in two rooms, which he has together
   up-stairs. We go and see him every day, but he is hardly
   able to talk to any one. Sir Gregory never mentions the
   subject to me, but Mrs. Brownlow is quite confident that
   if anything were to happen to Gregory Marrable, Walter
   would be asked to come to Dunripple as the heir, and to
   give up the army altogether.

   I get on very well with Mrs. Brownlow, but of course we
   cannot be like old friends. Edith is a very nice girl,
   but rather shy. She never talks about herself, and is too
   silent to be questioned. I do not, however, doubt for a
   moment but that she will be Walter Marrable's wife. I
   think it likely that they are not engaged as yet, as in
   that case I think Mrs. Brownlow would tell me; but many
   things have been said which leave on my mind a conviction
   that it will be so. He is to be here again in August, and
   from the way in which Mrs. Brownlow speaks of his coming,
   there is no doubt that she expects it. That he paid great
   attention to Edith when he was here before, I am quite
   sure; and I take it he is only waiting till--

In writing so far, Miss Marrable had intended to signify that Captain Marrable had been slow
to ask Edith Brownlow to be his wife while he was at Dunripple, because he could not bring
himself so soon to show himself indifferent to his former love; but that now he would not hesitate,
knowing as he would know, that his former love had bestowed herself elsewhere; but in this
there would have been a grievous accusation against Mary, and she was therefore compelled to
fill up her sentence in some other form;--

   till things should have arranged themselves a little.

   And it will be all for the best. She is a very nice,
   quiet, lady-like girl, and so great a favourite with her
   uncle, that should his son die before him, his great
   object in life will be her welfare. Walter Marrable, as
   her husband, would live at Dunripple, just as though the
   place were his own. And indeed there would be no one
   between him and the property except his own father. Some
   arrangement could be made as to buying out his life
   interest,--for which indeed he has taken the money
   beforehand with a vengeance,--and then Walter would be
   settled for life. Would not this be all for the best?

   I shall go home about the 14th. They want me to stay,
   but I shall have been away quite long enough. I don't
   know whether people ought to go from home at all after a
   certain age. I get cross because I can't have the sort of
   chair I like to sit on; and then they don't put any green
   tea into the pot, and I don't like to ask to have any
   made, as I doubt whether they have any green tea in the
   house. And I find it bad to be among invalids with whom,
   indeed, I can sympathise, but for whom I cannot pretend
   that I feel any great affection. As we grow old we become
   incapable of new tenderness, and rather resent the calls
   that are made upon us for pity. The luxury of devotion to
   misery is as much the privilege of the young as is that of
   devotion to love.

   Write soon, dearest; and remember that the best news
   I can have, will be tidings as to the day fixed for
   your marriage. And remember, too, that I won't have any
   question about your being married at Bullhampton. It would
   be quite improper. He must come to Loring; and I needn't
   say how glad I shall be to see the Fenwicks. Parson John
   will expect to marry you, but Mr. Fenwick might come and
   assist.

   Your most affectionate aunt,

   SARAH MARRABLE.

It was not the entreaty made by her aunt that an early day should be fixed for the marriage
which made Mary Lowther determine that she would yet once more attempt to drag the wagon. She
could have withstood such entreaty as that, and, had the letter gone no further, would probably
have replied to it by saying that no day could be fixed at all. But, with the letter there
came an assurance that Walter Marrable had forgotten her, was about to marry Edith Brownlow,
and that therefore all ideas of love and truth and sympathy and joint beating of mutual hearts,
with the rest of it, might be thrown to the winds. She would marry Harry Gilmore, and take
care that he had good dinners, and would give her mind to flannel petticoats and coal for the
poor of Bullhampton, and would altogether come down from the pedestal which she had once striven
to erect for herself. From that high but tottering pedestal, propped up on shafts of romance
and poetry, she would come down; but there would remain for her the lower, firmer standing
block, of which duty was the sole support. It was no doubt most unreasonable that any such
change should come upon her in consequence of her aunt's letter. She had never for a moment
told herself that Walter Marrable could ever be anything to her, since that day on which she
had by her own deed liberated him from his troth; and, indeed, had done more than that, had
forced him to accept that liberation. Why then should his engagement with another woman have
any effect with her either in one direction or in the other? She herself had submitted to a
new engagement,--had done so before he had shown any sign of being fickle. She could not therefore
be angry with him. And yet, because he could be fickle, because he could do that very thing
which she had openly declared her purpose of doing, she persuaded herself,--for a week or two,--that
any sacrifice made to him would be a sacrifice to folly, and a neglect of duty.

At this time, during this week or two, there came to her direct from the jewellers in London,
a magnificent set of rubies,--ear-rings, brooch, bracelets, and necklace. The rubies she had
seen before, and knew that they had belonged to Mr. Gilmore's mother. Mrs. Fenwick had told
him that the setting was so old that no lady could wear them now, and there had been a presentiment
that they would be forthcoming in a new form. Mary had said that, of course, such ornaments
as these would come into her hands only when she became Mrs. Gilmore. Mrs. Fenwick had laughed
and told her that she did not understand the romantic generosity of her lover. And now the
jewellery had come to her at the parsonage without a word from Gilmore, and was spread out
in its pretty cases on the vicarage drawing-room table. Now, if ever, must she say that she
could not do as she had promised.

"Mary," said Mrs. Fenwick, "you must go up to him to-morrow, and tell him how noble he is."

Mary waited, perhaps, for a whole minute before she answered. She would willingly have given
the jewels away for ever and ever, so that they might not have been there now to trouble her.
But she did answer at last, knowing, as she did so, that her last chance was gone.

"He is noble," she said, slowly; "and I will go and tell him so. I'll go now, if it is not
too late."

"Do, do. You'll be sure to find him." And Mrs. Fenwick, in her enthusiasm, embraced her friend
and kissed her.

Mary put on her hat and walked off at once through the garden and across the fields, and into
the Privets; and close to the house she met her lover. He did not see her till he heard her
step, and then turned short round, almost as though fearing something.

"Harry," she said, "those jewels have come. Oh, dear. They are not mine yet. Why did you have
them sent to me?"

There was something in the word yet, or in her tone as she spoke it, which made his heart leap
as it had never leaped before.

"If they're not yours, I don't know whom they belong to," he said. And his eye was bright,
and his voice almost shook with emotion.

"Are you doing anything?" she asked.

"Nothing on earth."

"Then come and see them."

So they walked off, and he, at any rate, on that occasion was a happy lover. For a few minutes,--perhaps
for an hour,--he did allow himself to believe that he was destined to enjoy that rapture of
requited affection, in longing for which his very soul had become sick. As she walked back
with him to the vicarage her hand rested heavily on his arm, and when she asked him some question
about his land, she was able so to modulate her voice as to make him believe that she was learning
to regard his interests as her own. He stopped her at the gate leading into the vicarage garden,
and once more made to her an assurance of his regard.

"Mary," he said, "if love will beget love, I think that you must love me at last."

"I will love you," she said, pressing his arm still more closely. But even then she could not
bring herself to tell him that she did love him.

CHAPTER LV.

GLEBE LAND.

The fifteenth of July was a Sunday, and it had been settled for some time past that on this
day Mr. Puddleham would preach for the first time in his new chapel. The building had been
hurried on through the early summer in order that this might be achieved; and although the
fittings were not completed, and the outward signs of the masons and labourers had not been
removed,--although the heaps of mortar were still there, and time had not yet sufficed to have
the chips cleared away,--on Sunday the fifteenth of July the chapel was opened. Great efforts
were made to have it filled on the occasion. The builder from Salisbury came over with all
his family, not deterred by the consideration that whereas the Puddlehamites of Bullhampton
were Primitive Methodists, he was a regular Wesleyan. And many in the parish were got to visit
the chapel on this the day of its glory, who had less business there than even the builder
from Salisbury. In most parishes there are some who think it well to let the parson know that
they are independent and do not care for him, though they profess to be of his flock; and then,
too, the novelty of the thing had its attraction, and the well-known fact that the site chosen
for the building had been as gall and wormwood to the parson and his family. These causes together
brought a crowd to the vicarage-gate on that Sunday morning, and it was quite clear that the
new chapel would be full, and that Mr. Puddleham's first Sunday would be a success. And the
chapel, of course, had a bell,--a bell which was declared by Mrs. Fenwick to be the hoarsest,
loudest, most unmusical, and ill-founded miscreant of a bell that was ever suspended over a
building for the torture of delicate ears. It certainly was a loud and brazen bell; but Mr.
Fenwick expressed his opinion that there was nothing amiss with it. When his wife declared
that it sounded as though it came from the midst of the shrubs at their own front gate, he
reminded her that their own church bells sounded as though they came from the lower garden.
That one sound should be held by them to be musical and the other abominable, he declared to
be a prejudice. Then there was a great argument about the bells, in which Mrs. Fenwick, and
Mary Lowther, and Harry Gilmore were all against the Vicar. And, throughout the discussion,
it was known to them all that there were no ears in the parish to which the bells were so really
odious as they were to the ears of the Vicar himself. In his heart of hearts he hated the chapel,
and, in spite of all his endeavours to the contrary, his feelings towards Mr. Puddleham were
not those which the Christian religion requires one neighbour to bear to another. But he made
the struggle, and for some weeks past had not said a word against Mr. Puddleham. In regard
to the Marquis the thing was different. The Marquis should have known better, and against the
Marquis he did say a great many words.

They began to ring the bell on that Sunday morning before ten o'clock. Mrs. Fenwick was still
sitting at the breakfast-table, with the windows open, when the sound was first heard,--first
heard, that is, on that morning. She looked at Mary, groaned, and put her hands to her ears.
The Vicar laughed, and walked about the room.

"At what time do they begin?" said Mary.

"Not till eleven," said Mrs. Fenwick. "There, it wants a quarter to ten now, and they mean
to go on with that music for an hour and a quarter."

"We shall be keeping them company by-and-by," said the Vicar.

"The poor old church bells won't be heard through it," said Mrs. Fenwick.

Mrs. Fenwick was in the habit of going to the village school for half an hour before the service
on Sunday mornings, and on this morning she started from the house according to her custom
at a little after ten. Mary Lowther went with her, and as the school was in the village and
could be reached much more shortly by the front gate than by the path round by the church,
the two ladies walked out boldly before the new chapel. The reader may perhaps remember that
Mrs. Fenwick had promised her husband to withdraw that outward animosity to the chapel which
she had evinced by not using the vicarage entrance. As they went there was a crowd collected,
and they found that after the manner of the Primitive Methodists in their more enthusiastic
days, a procession of worshippers had been formed in the village, which at this very moment
was making its way to the chapel. Mrs. Fenwick, as she stood aside to make way for them, declared
that the bell sounded as though it were within her bonnet. When they reached the school they
found that many a child was absent who should have been there, and Mrs. Fenwick knew that the
truant urchins were amusing themselves at the new building. And with those who were not truant
the clang of the new bell distracted terribly that attention which was due to the collect.
Mrs. Fenwick herself confessed afterwards that she hardly knew what she was teaching.

Mr. Fenwick, according to his habit, went into his own study when the ladies went to the school,
and there, according to custom also on Sunday mornings, his letters were brought to him, some
few minutes before he started on his walk through the garden to the church. On this morning
there were a couple of letters for himself, and he opened them both. One was from a tradesman
in Salisbury, and the other was from his wife's brother-in-law, Mr. Quickenham. Before he started
he read Mr. Quickenham's letter, and then did his best to forget it and put it out of his mind
till the morning service should be over. The letter was as follows:--

   Pump Court, June 30, 1868.

   DEAR FENWICK,

   I have found, as I thought I should, that Lord Trowbridge
   has no property in, or right whatever to, the bit of
   ground on which your enemies have been building their new
   Ebenezer. The spot is a part of the glebe, and as such
   seems to have been first abandoned by a certain parson
   named Brandon, who was your predecessor's predecessor.
   There can, however, be no doubt that the ground is glebe,
   and that you are bound to protect it as such, on behalf of
   your successors, and of the patrons of the living.

   I found some difficulty in getting at the terrier of the
   parish,--which you, who consider yourself to be a model
   parson, I dare say, have never seen. I have, however,
   found it in duplicate. The clerk of the Board of
   Guardians, who should, I believe, have a copy of it, knew
   nothing about it; and had never heard of such a document.
   Your bishop's registrar was not much more learned,--but I
   did find it in the bishop's chancery; and there is a copy
   of it also at Saint John's, which seems to imply that
   great attention has been paid by the college as patron to
   the interests of the parish priest. This is more than has
   been done by the incumbent, who seems to be an ignorant
   fellow in such matters. I wonder how many parsons there
   are in the Church who would let a Marquis and a Methodist
   minister between them build a chapel on the parish glebe?

   Yours ever,

   RICHARD QUICKENHAM.

   If I were to charge you through an attorney for my trouble
   you'd have to mortgage your life interest in the bit of
   land to pay me. I enclose a draft from the terrier as far
   as the plot of ground and the vicarage-gate are concerned.

Here was information! This detestable combination of dissenting and tyrannically territorial
influences had been used to build a Methodist Chapel upon land of which he, during his incumbency
in the parish, was the freehold possessor! What an ass he must have been not to know his own
possessions! How ridiculous would he appear when he should come forward to claim as a part
of the glebe a morsel of land to which he had paid no special attention whatever since he had
been in the parish! And then, what would it be his duty to do? Mr. Quickenham had clearly stated
that on behalf of the college, which was the patron of the living, and on behalf of his successors,
it was his duty to claim the land. And was it possible that he should not do so after such
usage as he had received from Lord Trowbridge? So meditating,--but grieving that he should
be driven at such a moment to have his mind forcibly filled with such matters,--still hearing
the chapel bell, which in his ears drowned the sound from his own modest belfry, and altogether
doubtful as to what step he would take, he entered his own church. It was manifest to him that
of the poorer part of his usual audience, and of the smaller farmers, one half were in attendance
upon Mr. Puddleham's triumph.

During the whole of that afternoon he said not a word of the barrister's letter to any one.
He struggled to banish the subject from his thoughts. Failing to do that, he did banish it
from his tongue. The letter was in the pocket of his coat; but he showed it to no one. Gilmore
dined at the vicarage; but even to him he was silent. Of course the conversation at dinner
turned upon the chapel. It was impossible that on such a day they should speak of anything
else. Even as they sat at their early dinner Mr. Puddleham's bell was ringing, and no doubt
there was a vigour in the pulling of it which would not be maintained when the pulling of it
should have become a thing of every week. There had been a compact made, in accordance with
which the Vicar's wife was to be debarred from saying anything against the chapel, and, no
doubt, when the compact was made, the understanding was that she should give over hating the
chapel. This had, of course, been found to be impossible, but in a certain way she had complied
with the compact. The noise of the bell however, was considered to be beyond the compact, and
on this occasion she was almost violent in the expression of her wrath. Her husband listened
to her, and sat without rebuking her, silent, with the lawyer's letter in his pocket. This
bell had been put up on his own land, and he could pull it down to-morrow. It had been put
up by the express agency of Lord Trowbridge, and with the direct view of annoying him; and
Lord Trowbridge had behaved to him in a manner which set all Christian charity at defiance.
He told himself plainly that he had no desire to forgive Lord Trowbridge,--that life in this
world, as it is constituted, would not be compatible with such forgiveness,--that he would
not, indeed, desire to injure Lord Trowbridge otherwise than by exacting such penalty as would
force him and such as he to restrain their tyranny; but that to forgive him, till he should
have been so forced, would be weak and injurious to the community. As to that, he had quite
made up his mind, in spite of all doctrine to the contrary. Men in this world would have to
go naked if they gave their coats to the robbers who took their cloaks; and going naked is
manifestly inexpedient. His office of parish priest would be lowered in the world if he forgave,
out of hand, such offences as these which had been committed against him by Lord Trowbridge.
This he understood clearly. And now he might put down, not only the bell, but with the bell
the ill-conditioned peer who had caused it to be put up--on glebe land. All this went through
his mind again and again, as he determined that on that day, being Sunday, he would think no
more about it.

When the Monday came it was necessary that he should show the letter to his wife,--to his wife,
and to the Squire, and to Mary Lowther. He had no idea of keeping the matter secret from his
near friends and advisers; but he had an idea that it would be well that he should make up
his mind as to what he would do before he asked their advice. He started, therefore, for a
turn through the parish before breakfast on Monday morning,--and resolved as to his course
of action. On no consideration whatever would he have the chapel pulled down. It was necessary
for his purpose that he should have his triumph over the Marquis,--and he would have it. But
the chapel had been built for a good purpose which it would adequately serve, and let what
might be said to him by his wife or others, he would not have a brick of it disturbed. No doubt
he had no more power to give the land for its present or any other purpose than had the Marquis.
It might very probably be his duty to take care that the land was not appropriated to wrong
purposes. It might be that he had already neglected his duty, in not knowing, or in not having
taken care to learn the precise limits of the glebe which had been given over to him for his
use during his incumbency. Nevertheless, there was the chapel, and there it should stand, as
far as he was concerned. If the churchwardens, or the archdeacon, or the college, or the bishop
had power to interfere, as to which he was altogether ignorant, and chose to exercise that
power, he could not help it. He was nearly sure that his own churchwardens would be guided
altogether by himself,--and as far as he was concerned the chapel should remain unmolested.
Having thus resolved he came back to breakfast and read Mr. Quickenham's letter aloud to his
wife and Mary Lowther.

"Glebe!" said the Vicar's wife.

"Do you mean that it is part of your own land?" asked Mary.

"Exactly that," said the Vicar.

"And that old thief of a Marquis has given away what belongs to us?" said Mrs. Fenwick.

"He has given away what did not belong to himself," said the Vicar. "But I can't admit that
he's a thief."

"Surely he ought to have known," said Mary.

"As for that, so ought I to have known, I suppose. The whole thing is one of the most ridiculous
mistakes that ever was made. It has absolutely come to pass that here, in the middle of Wiltshire,
with all our maps, and surveys, and parish records, no one concerned has known to whom belonged
a quarter of an acre of land in the centre of the village. It is just a thing to write an article
about in a newspaper; but I can't say that one party is more to blame than the other; that
is, in regard to the ignorance displayed."

"And what will you do, Frank?"

"Nothing."

"You will do nothing, Frank?"

"I will do nothing; but I will take care to let the Marquis know the nature of his generosity.
I fancy that I am bound to take on myself that labour, and I must say that it won't trouble
me much to have to write the letter."

"You won't pull it down, Frank?"

"No, my dear."

"I would, before a week was over."

"So would I," said Mary. "I don't think it ought to be there."

"Of course it ought not to be there," said Mrs. Fenwick.

"They might as well have it here in the garden," said Mary.

"Just the same," said Mrs. Fenwick.

"It is not in the garden; and, as it has been built, it shall remain,--as far as I am concerned.
I shall rather like it, now that I know I am the landlord. I think I shall claim a sitting."
This was the Vicar's decision on the Monday morning, and from that decision the two ladies
were quite unable to move him.

This occurred a day or two after the affair of the rubies, and at a time when Mary was being
very hard pressed to name a day for her wedding. Of course such pressure had been the result
of Mr. Gilmore's success on that occasion. She had then resolutely gone to work to overcome
her own, and his, melancholy gloom, and, having in a great degree succeeded, it was only natural
that he should bring up that question of his marriage day. She, when she had accepted him,
had done so with a stipulation that she should not be hurried; but we all know what such stipulations
are worth. Who is to define what is and what is not hurry? They had now been engaged a month,
and the Squire was clearly of opinion that there had been no hurry. "September was the nicest
month in the year," he said, "for getting married and going abroad. September in Switzerland,
October among the Italian lakes, November in Florence and Rome. So that they might get home
before Christmas after a short visit to Naples." That was the Squire's programme, and his whole
manner was altered as he made it. He thought he knew the nature of the girl well enough to
be sure that, though she would profess no passionate love for him before starting on such a
journey, she would change her tone before she returned. It should be no fault of his if she
did not change it. Mary had at first declined to fix any day, had talked of next year, had
declared that she would not be hurried. She had carried on the fight even after the affair
of the rubies, but she had fought in opposition to strong and well-disciplined forces on the
other side, and she had begun to admit to herself that it might be expedient that she should
yield. The thing was to be done, and why not have it done at once? She had not as yet yielded,
but she had begun to think that she would yield.

At such a period it was of course natural that the Squire should be daily at the vicarage,
and on this Monday morning he came down while the minds of all his friends there were intent
on the strange information received from Mr. Quickenham. The Vicar was not by when Mr. Gilmore
was told, and he was thus easily induced to join in the opinion that the chapel should be made
to disappear. He had a landlord's idea about land, and was thoroughly well-disposed to stop
any encroachment on the part of the Marquis.

"Lord Trowbridge must pull it down himself, and put it up again elsewhere," said the Squire.

"But Frank says that he won't let the Marquis pull it down," said Mrs. Fenwick, almost moved
to tears by the tragedy of the occasion.

Then the Vicar joined them, and the matter was earnestly debated;--so earnestly that, on that
occasion, not a word was said as to the day of the wedding.

CHAPTER LVI.

THE VICAR'S VENGEANCE.

No eloquence on the part of the two ladies at the vicarage, or of the Squire, could turn Mr.
Fenwick from his purpose, but he did consent at last to go over with the Squire to Salisbury,
and to consult Mr. Chamberlaine. A proposition was made to him as to consulting the bishop,
for whom personally he always expressed a liking, and whose office he declared that he held
in the highest veneration; but he explained that this was not a matter in which the bishop
should be invited to exercise authority.

"The bishop has nothing to do with my freehold," he said.

"But if you want an opinion," said the Squire, "why not go to a man whose opinion will be worth
having?"

Then the Vicar explained again. His respect for the bishop was so great, that any opinion coming
from his lordship would, to him, be more than advice; it would be law. So great was his mingled
admiration of the man and respect for the office!

"What he means," said Mrs. Fenwick, "is, that he won't go to the bishop, because he has made
up his mind already. You are, both of you, throwing away your time and money in going to Salisbury
at all."

"I'm not sure but what she's right there," said the Vicar. Nevertheless they went to Salisbury.

The Rev. Henry Fitzackerly Chamberlaine was very eloquent, clear, and argumentative on the
subject, and perhaps a little overbearing. He insisted that the chapel should be removed without
a moment's delay; and that notice as to its removal should be served upon all the persons concerned,--upon
Mr. Puddleham, upon the builder, upon the chapel trustees, the elders of the congregation,--"if
there be any elders," said Mr. Chamberlaine, with a delightful touch of irony,--and upon the
Marquis and the Marquis's agent. He was eloquent, authoritative and loud. When the Vicar remarked
that after all the chapel had been built for a good purpose, Mr. Chamberlaine became quite
excited in his eloquence.

"The glebe of Bullhampton, Mr. Fenwick," said he, "has not been confided to your care for the
propagation of dissent."

"Nor has the vicarage house been confided to me for the reading of novels; but that is what
goes on there."

"The house is for your private comfort," said the prebendary.

"And so is the glebe," said the Vicar; "and I shall not be comfortable if I make these people
put down a house of prayer."

And there was another argument against the Vicar's views, very strong. This glebe was only
given to him in trust. He was bound so to use it, that it should fall into the hands of his
successor unimpaired and with full capability for fruition. "You have no right to leave to
another the demolition of a building, the erection of which you should have prevented." This
argument was more difficult of answer than the other, but Mr. Fenwick did answer it.

"I feel all that," said he; "and I think it likely that my estate may be liable for the expense
of removal. The chapel may be brought in as a dilapidation. But that which I can answer with
my purse, need not lie upon my conscience. I could let the bit of land, I have no doubt,--though
not on a building lease."

"But they have built on it," said Mr. Chamberlaine.

"No doubt, they have; and I can see that my estate may be called upon to restore the bit of
ground to its former position. What I can't see is, that I am bound to enforce the removal now."

Mr. Chamberlaine took up the matter with great spirit, and gave a couple of hours to the discussion,
but the Vicar was not shaken.

The Vicar was not shaken, but his manner as he went out from the prebendary's presence, left
some doubt as to his firmness in the mind both of that dignitary and of the Squire. He thanked
Mr. Chamberlaine very courteously, and acknowledged that there was a great deal in the arguments
which had been used.

"I am sure you will find it best to clear your ground of the nuisance at once," said Mr. Chamberlaine,
with that high tone which he knew so well how to assume; and these were the last words spoken.

"Well?" said the Squire, as soon as they were out in the Close, asking his friend as to his
decision.

"It's a very knotty point," said Fenwick.

"I don't much like my uncle's tone," said the Squire; "I never do. But I think he is right."

"I won't say but what he may be."

"It'll have to come down, Frank," said the Squire.

"No doubt, some day. But I am quite sure as to this, Harry; that when you have a doubt as to
your duty, you can't be wrong in delaying that, the doing of which would gratify your own ill
will. Don't you go and tell this to the women; but to my eyes that conventicle at Bullhampton
is the most hideous, abominable, and disagreeable object that ever was placed upon the earth!"

"So it is to mine," said the Squire.

"And therefore I won't touch a brick of it. It shall be my hair shirt, my fast day, my sacrifice
of a broken heart, my little pet good work. It will enable me to take all the good things of
the world that come in my way, and flatter myself that I am not self-indulgent. There is not
a dissenter in Bullhampton will get so much out of the chapel as I will."

"I fancy they can make you have it pulled down."

"Then their making me shall be my hair shirt, and I shall be fitted just as well." Upon that
they went back to Bullhampton, and the Squire told the two ladies what had passed; as to the
hair shirt and all.

Mr. Fenwick in making for himself his hair shirt did not think it necessary to abstain from
writing to the Marquis of Trowbridge. This he did on that same day after his return from Salisbury.
In the middle of the winter he had written a letter to the Marquis, remonstrating against the
building of the chapel opposite to his own gate. He now took out his copy of that letter, and
the answer to it, in which the agent of the Marquis had told him that the Marquis considered
that the spot in question was the most eligible site which his lordship could bestow for the
purpose in question. Our Vicar was very anxious not to disturb the chapel now that it was built;
but he was quite as anxious to disturb the Marquis. In the formation of that hair shirt which
he was minded to wear, he did not intend to weave in any mercy towards the Marquis. It behoved
him to punish the Marquis,--for the good of society in general. As a trespasser he forgave
the Marquis, in a Christian point of view; but as a pestilent wasp on the earth, stinging folks
right and left with an arrogance, the ignorance of which was the only excuse to be made for
his cruelty, he thought it to be his duty to set his heel upon the Marquis; which he did by
writing the following letter.

   Bullhampton Vicarage, July 18, 186--.

   MY LORD MARQUIS,

   On the 3rd of January last I ventured to write to your
   lordship with the object of saving myself and my family
   from a great annoyance, and of saving you also from the
   disgrace of subjecting me to it. I then submitted to you
   the expediency of giving in the parish some other site for
   the erection of a dissenting chapel than the small patch
   of ground immediately opposite to the vicarage gate,
   which, as I explained to you, I had always regarded as
   belonging to the vicarage. I did not for a moment question
   your lordship's right to give the land in question, but
   appealed simply to your good-feeling. I confess that I
   took it for granted that even your lordship, in so very
   high-handed a proceeding, would take care to have right
   on your side. In answer to this I received a letter from
   your man of business, of which, as coming from him, I do
   not complain, but which, as a reply to my letter to your
   lordship, was an insult. The chapel has been built, and on
   last Sunday was opened for worship.

   I have now learned that the land which you have given
   away did not belong to your lordship, and never formed a
   portion of the Stowte estate in this parish. It was, and
   is, glebe land; and formed, at the time of your bestowal,
   a portion of my freehold as Vicar. I acknowledge that I
   was remiss in presuming that you as a landlord knew the
   limits of your own rights, and that you would not trespass
   beyond them. I should have made my inquiry more urgently.
   I have made it now, and your lordship may satisfy yourself
   by referring to the maps of the parish lands, which are to
   be found in the bishop's chancery, and also at St. John's,
   Oxford, if you cannot do so by any survey of the estate in
   your own possession. I enclose a sketch showing the exact
   limits of the glebe in respect to the vicarage entrance
   and the patch of ground in question. The fact is, that the
   chapel in question has been built on the glebe land by
   authority--illegally and unjustly given by your lordship.

   The chapel is there, and though it is a pity that it
   should have been built, it would be a greater pity that it
   should be pulled down. It is my purpose to offer to the
   persons concerned a lease of the ground for the term of my
   incumbency at a nominal rent. I presume that a lease may
   be so framed as to protect the rights of my successor.

   I will not conclude this letter without expressing my
   opinion that gross as has been your lordship's ignorance
   in giving away land which did not belong to you, your
   fault in that respect has been very trifling in comparison
   with the malice you have shown to a clergyman of your own
   church, settled in a parish partly belonging to yourself,
   in having caused the erection of this chapel on the
   special spot selected with no other object than that of
   destroying my personal comfort and that of my wife.

   I have the honour to be
   Your lordship's most obedient servant,

   FRANCIS FENWICK.

When he had finished his epistle he read it over more than once, and was satisfied that it
would be vexatious to the Marquis. It was his direct object to vex the Marquis, and he had
set about it with all his vigour. "I would skin him if I knew how," he had said to Gilmore.
"He has done that to me which no man should forgive. He has spoken ill of me, and calumniated
me, not because he has thought ill of me, but because he has had a spite against me. They may
keep their chapel as far as I am concerned. But as for his lordship, I should think ill of
myself if I spared him." He had his lordship on the hip, and he did not spare him. He showed
the letter to his wife.

"Isn't malice a very strong word?" she said.

"I hope so," answered the Vicar.

"What I mean is, might you not soften it without hurting your cause?"

"I think not. I conscientiously believe the accusation to be true. I endeavour so to live among
my neighbours that I may not disgrace them, or you, or myself. This man has dared to accuse
me openly of the grossest immorality and hypocrisy, when I am only doing my duty as I best
know how to do it; and I do now believe in my heart that in making these charges he did not
himself credit them. At any rate, no man can be justified in making such charges without evidence."

"But all that had nothing to do with the bit of ground, Frank."

"It is part and parcel of the same thing. He has chosen to treat me as an enemy, and has used
all the influence of his wealth and rank to injure me. Now he must look to himself. I will
not say a word of him, or to him, that is untrue; but as he has said evil of me behind my back
which he did not believe, so will I say the evil of him, which I do believe, to his face."
The letter was sent, and before the day was over the Vicar had recovered his good humour.

And before the day was over the news was all through the parish. There was a certain ancient
shoemaker in the village who had carried on business in Devizes, and had now retired to spend
the evening of his life in his native place. Mr. Bolt was a quiet, inoffensive old man, but
he was a dissenter, and was one of the elders and trustees who had been concerned in raising
money for the chapel. To him the Vicar had told the whole story, declaring at the same time
that, as far as he was concerned, Mr. Puddleham and his congregation should, at any rate for
the present, be made welcome to their chapel. This he had done immediately on his return from
Salisbury, and before the letter to the Marquis was written. Mr. Bolt, not unnaturally, saw
his minister the same evening, and the thing was discussed in full conclave by the Puddlehamites.
At the end of that discussion, Mr. Puddleham expressed his conviction that the story was a
mare's nest from beginning to end. He didn't believe a word of it. The Marquis was not the
man to give away anything that did not belong to him. Somebody had hoaxed the Vicar, or the
Vicar had hoaxed Mr. Bolt; or else,--which Mr. Puddleham thought to be most likely,--the Vicar
had gone mad with vexation at the glory and the triumph of the new chapel.

"He was uncommon civil," said Mr. Bolt, who at this moment was somewhat inclined to favour
the Vicar.

"No doubt, Mr. Bolt; no doubt," said Mr. Puddleham, who had quite recovered from his first
dismay, and had worked himself up to a state of eloquent enthusiasm. "I dare say he was civil.
Why not? In old days when we hardly dared to talk of having a decent house of prayer of our
own in which to worship our God, he was always civil. No one has ever heard me accuse Mr. Fenwick
of incivility. But will any one tell me that he is a friend to our mode of worship? Gentlemen,
we must look to ourselves, and I for one tell you that that chapel is ours. You won't find
that his ban will keep me out of my pulpit. Glebe, indeed! why should the Vicar have glebe
on the other side of the road from his house? Or, for the matter of that, why should he have
glebe at all?" This was so decisive that no one at the meeting had a word to say after Mr.
Puddleham had finished his speech.

When the Marquis received his letter he was up in London. Lord Trowbridge was not much given
to London life, but was usually compelled by circumstances,--the circumstances being the custom
of society as pleaded by his two daughters,--to spend the months of May, June, and July at
the family mansion in Grosvenor Square. Moreover, though the Marquis never opened his mouth
in the House of Lords, it was, as he thought, imperative on him to give to the leader of his
party the occasional support of his personal presence. Our Vicar, knowing this, had addressed
his letter to Grosvenor Square, and it had thus reached its destination without loss of time.
Lord Trowbridge by this time knew the handwriting of his enemy; and, as he broke the envelope,
there came upon him an idea that it might be wise to refuse the letter, and to let it go back
to its writer unopened. It was beneath his dignity to correspond with a man, or to receive
letters from a man who would probably insult him. But before he could make up his mind, the
envelope had been opened, and the letter had been read. His wrath, when he had read it, no
writer of a simple prose narration should attempt to describe. "Disgrace," "insult," "ignorance,"
and "malice,"--these were the words with which the Marquis found himself pelted by this pestilent,
abominable, and most improper clergyman. As to the gist of the letter itself, it was some time
before he understood it. And when he did begin to understand it, he did not as yet begin to
believe it. His intelligence worked slowly, whereas his wrath worked quickly. But at last he
began to ask himself whether the accusation made against him could possibly be based on truth.
When the question of giving the land had been under consideration, it had never occurred to
any one concerned that it could belong to the glebe. There had been some momentary suspicion
that the spot might possibly have been so long used as common land as to give room for a question
on that side; but no one had dreamed that any other claimant could arise. That the whole village
of Bullhampton belonged to the Marquis was notorious. Of course there was the glebe. But who
could think that the morsel of neglected land lying on the other side of the road belonged
to the vicarage? The Marquis did not believe it now. This was some piece of wickedness concocted
by the venomous brain of the iniquitous Vicar, more abominable than all his other wickednesses.
The Marquis did not believe it; but he walked up and down his room all the morning thinking
of it. The Marquis was sure that it was not true, and yet he could not for a moment get the
idea out of his mind. Of course he must tell St. George. The language of the letter which had
been sent to him was so wicked, that St. George must at least agree with him now in his anger
against this man. And could nothing be done to punish the man? Prosecutions in regard to anonymous
letters, threatening letters, begging letters, passed through his mind. He knew that punishment
had been inflicted on the writers of insolent letters to royalty. And letters had been proved
to be criminal as being libellous,--only then they must be published; and letters were sometimes
held to form a conspiracy;--but he could not quite see his way to that. He knew that he was
not royal; and he knew that the Vicar neither threatened him or begged aught from him. What
if St. George should tell him again that this Vicar had right on his side! He cast the matter
about in his mind all the day; and then, late in the afternoon, he got into his carriage, and
had himself driven to the chambers of Messrs. Boothby, the family lawyers.

CHAPTER LVII.

OIL IS TO BE THROWN UPON THE WATERS.

Messrs. Boothby in Lincoln's Inn had for very many years been the lawyers of the Stowte family,
and probably knew as much about the property as any of the Stowtes themselves. They had not
been consulted about the giving away of the bit of land for the chapel purposes, nor had they
been instructed to draw up any deed of gift. The whole thing had been done irregularly. The
land had been only promised, and not in truth as yet given, and the Puddlehamites, in their
hurry, had gone to work and had built upon a promise. The Marquis, when, after the receipt
of Mr. Fenwick's letter, his first rage was over, went at once to the chambers of Messrs. Boothby,
and was forced to explain all the circumstances of the case to the senior partner before he
could show the clergyman's wicked epistle. Old Mr. Boothby was a man of the same age as the
Marquis, and, in his way, quite as great. Only the lawyer was a clever old man, whereas the
Marquis was a stupid old man. Mr. Boothby sat, bowing his head, as the Marquis told his story.
The story was rather confused, and for awhile Mr. Boothby could only understand that a dissenting
chapel had been built upon his client's land.

"We shall have to set it right by some scrap of a conveyance," said the lawyer.

"But the Vicar of the parish claims it," said the Marquis.

"Claims the chapel, my lord!"

"He is a most pestilent, abominable man, Mr. Boothby. I have brought his letter here." Mr.
Boothby held out his hand to receive the letter. From almost any client he would prefer a document
to an oral explanation, but he would do so especially from his lordship. "But you must understand,"
continued the Marquis, "that he is quite unlike any ordinary clergyman. I have the greatest
respect for the church, and am always happy to see clergymen at my own house. But this is a
litigious, quarrelsome fellow. They tell me he's an infidel, and he keeps--! Altogether, Mr.
Boothby, nothing can be worse."

"Indeed!" said the lawyer, still holding out his hand for the letter.

"He has taken the trouble to insult me continually. You heard how a tenant of mine was murdered?
He was murdered by a young man whom this clergyman screens, because,--because,--he is the brother
of,--of,--of the young woman."

"That would be very bad, my lord."

"It is very bad. He knows all about the murder;--I am convinced he does. He went bail for the
young man. He used to associate with him on most intimate terms. As to the sister;--there's
no doubt about that. They live on the land of a person who owns a small estate in the parish."

"Mr. Gilmore, my lord?"

"Exactly so. This Mr. Fenwick has got Mr. Gilmore in his pocket. You can have no idea of such
a state of things as this. And now he writes me this letter! I know his handwriting now, and
any further communication I shall return." The Marquis ceased to speak, and the lawyer at once
buried himself in the letter.

"It is meant to be offensive," said the lawyer.

"Most insolent, most offensive, most improper! And yet the bishop upholds him!"

"But if he is right about the bit of land, my lord, it will be rather awkward." And as he spoke,
the lawyer examined the sketch of the vicarage entrance. "He gives this as copied from the
terrier of the parish, my lord."

"I don't believe a word of it," said the Marquis.

"You didn't look at the plan of the estate, my lord?"

 Do you
think that I would allow it to stand when it has been erected on his ground,--through my error?
Not for a day!--not for an hour! I'll tell you what, Mr. Boothby,--that man has known it all
through;--has known it as well as you do now; but he has waited till the building was complete
before he would tell me. I see it all as plain as the nose on your face, Mr. Boothby."

The lawyer was meditating how best he might explain to his angry client that he had no power
whatsoever to pull down the building,--that if the Vicar and the dissenting minister chose
to agree about it the new building must stand, in spite of the Marquis,--must stand, unless
the churchwardens, patron, or ecclesiastical authorities generally should force the Vicar to
have it removed,--when a clerk came in and whispered a word to the attorney. "My lord," said
Mr. Boothby, "Lord St. George is here. Shall he come in?"

The Marquis did not wish to see his son exactly at this minute; but Lord St. George was, of
course, admitted. This meeting at the lawyer's chambers was altogether fortuitous, and father
and son were equally surprised. But so great was the anger and dismay and general perturbation
of the Marquis at the time, that he could not stop to ask any question. St. George must, of
course, know what had happened, and it was quite as well that he should be told at once.

"That bit of ground they've built the chapel on at Bullhampton, turns out to be--glebe," said
the Marquis. Lord St. George whistled. "Of course, Mr. Fenwick knew it all along," said the
Marquis.

"I should hardly think that," said his son.

"You read his letter. Mr. Boothby, will you be so good as to show Lord St. George the letter?
You never read such a production. Impudent scoundrel! Of course he knew it all the time."

Lord St. George read the letter. "He is very impudent, whether he be a scoundrel or not."

"Impudent is no word for it."

"Perhaps he has had some provocation, my lord."

"Not from me, St. George;--not from me. I have done nothing to him. Of course the chapel must
be--removed."

"Don't you think the question might stand over for a while?" suggested Mr. Boothby. "Matters
would become smoother in a month or two."

"Not for an hour," said the Marquis.

Lord St. George walked about the room with the letter in his hand, meditating. "The truth is,"
he said, at last, "we have made a mistake, and we must get out of it as best we can. I think
my father is a little wrong about this clergyman's character."

"St. George! Have you read his letter? Is that a proper letter to come from a clergyman of
the Church of England to--to--to--" the Marquis longed to say to the Marquis of Trowbridge;
but he did not dare so to express himself before his son,--"to the landlord of his parish?"

"A red-brick chapel, just close to your lodge, isn't nice, you know."

"He has got no lodge," said the Marquis.

"And so we thought we'd build him one. Let me manage this. I'll see him, and I'll see the minister,
and I'll endeavour to throw some oil upon the waters."

"I don't want to throw oil upon the waters."

"Lord St. George is in the right, my lord," said the attorney; "he really is. It is a case
in which we must throw a little oil upon the waters. We've made a mistake, and when we've done
that we should always throw oil upon the waters. I've no doubt Lord St. George will find a
way out of it." Then the father and the son went away together, and before they had reached
the Houses of Parliament Lord St. George had persuaded his father to place the matter of the
Bullhampton chapel in his hands. "And as for the letter," said St. George, "do not you notice it."

"I have not the slightest intention of noticing it," said the Marquis, haughtily.

CHAPTER LVIII.

EDITH BROWNLOW'S DREAM.

"My dear, sit down; I want to speak to you. Do you know I should like to see you--married."
This speech was made at Dunripple to Edith Brownlow by her uncle, Sir Gregory, one morning
in July, as she was attending him with his breakfast. His breakfast consisted always of a cup
of chocolate, made after a peculiar fashion, and Edith was in the habit of standing by the
old man's bedside while he took it. She would never sit down, because she knew that were she
to do so she would be pretty nearly hidden out of sight in the old arm-chair that stood at
the bed-head; but now she was specially invited to do so, and that in a manner which almost
made her think that it would be well that she should hide herself for a space. But she did
not sit down. There was the empty cup to be taken from Sir Gregory's hands, and, after the
first moment of surprise, Edith was not quite sure that it would be good that she should hide
herself. She took the cup and put it on the table, and then returned, without making any reply.
"I should like very much to see you married, my dear," said Sir Gregory, in the mildest of voices.

"Do you want to get rid of me, uncle?"

"No, my dear; that is just what I don't want. Of course you'll marry somebody."

"I don't see any of course, Uncle Gregory."

"But why shouldn't you? I suppose you have thought about it."

"Only in a general way, Uncle Gregory."

Sir Gregory Marrable was not a wise man. His folly was of an order very different from that
of Lord Trowbridge,--very much less likely to do harm to himself or others, much more innocent,
and, folly though it was, a great deal more compatible with certain intellectual gifts. Lord
Trowbridge, not to put too fine a point upon it, was a fool all round. He was much too great
a fool to have an idea of his own folly. Now Sir Gregory distrusted himself in everything,
conceived himself to be a poor creature, would submit himself to a child on any question of
literature, and had no opinion of his own on any matter outside his own property,--and even
as to that his opinion was no more than lukewarm. Yet he read a great deal, had much information
stored away somewhere in his memory, and had learned at any rate to know how small a fly he
was himself on the wheel of the world. But, alas, when he did meddle with anything he was apt
to make a mess of it. There had been some conversation between him and his sister-in-law, Edith's
mother, about Walter Marrable; some also between him and his son, and between him and Miss
Marrable, his cousin. But as yet no one had spoken to Edith, and as Captain Marrable himself
had not spoken, it would have been as well, perhaps, if Sir Gregory had held his tongue. After
Edith's last answer the old man was silent for awhile, and then he returned to the subject
with a downright question,--

"How did you like Walter when he was here?"

"Captain Marrable?"

"Yes,--Captain Marrable."

"I liked him well enough,--in a way, Uncle Gregory."

"Nothing would please me so much, Edith, as that you should become his wife. You know that
Dunripple will belong to him some day."

"If Gregory does not marry." Edith had hardly known whether to say this or to leave it unsaid.
She was well aware that her cousin Gregory would never marry,--that he was a confirmed invalid,
a man already worn out, old before his time, and with one foot in the grave. But had she not
said it, she would have seemed to herself to have put him aside as a person altogether out
of the way.

"Gregory will never marry. Of course while he lives Dunripple will be his; but if Walter were
to marry he would make arrangements. I dare say you can't understand all about that, my dear;
but it would be a very good thing. I should be so happy if I thought that you were to live
at Dunripple always."

Edith kissed him and escaped without giving any other answer. Ten days after that Walter Marrable
was to be again at Dunripple,--only for a few days; but still in a few days the thing might
be settled. Edith had heard something of Mary Lowther, but not much. There had been some idea
of a match between Walter and his cousin Mary, but the idea had been blown away. So much Edith
had heard. To herself Walter Marrable had been very friendly, and, in truth, she had liked
him much. They two were not cousins, but they were so connected, and had for some weeks been
so thrown together, as to be almost as good as cousins. His presence at Dunripple had been
very pleasant to her, but she had never thought of him as a lover. And she had an idea of her
own, that girls ought not to think of men as lovers without a good deal of provocation.

Sir Gregory spoke to Mrs. Brownlow on the same subject, and as he told her what had taken place
between him and Edith, she felt herself compelled to speak to her daughter.

"If it should take place, my dear, it would be very well; but I would rather your uncle had
not mentioned it."

"It won't do any harm, mamma. I mean, that I shan't break my heart."

"I believe him to be a very excellent young man,--not at all like his father, who has been
as bad as he can be."

"Wasn't he in love with Mary Lowther last winter?"

"I don't know, my dear. I never believe stories of this kind. When I hear that a young man
is going to be married to a young lady, then I believe that they are in love with each other."

"It is to be hoped so then, mamma?"

"But I never believe any thing before. And I think you may take it for granted that there is
nothing in that."

"It would be nothing to me, mamma."

"It might be something. But I will say nothing more about it. You've so much good sense that
I am quite sure you won't get into trouble. I wish Sir Gregory had not spoken to you; but as
he has, it may be as well that you should know that the family arrangement would be very agreeable
to your uncle and to cousin Gregory. The title and the property must go to Captain Marrable
at last, and Sir Gregory would make immediate sacrifices for you, which perhaps he would not
make for him."

Edith understood all about it very clearly, and would have understood all about it with half
the words. She would have little or no fortune of her own, and in money her uncle would have
very little to give to her. Indeed, there was no reason why he should give her anything. She
was not connected with any of the Marrables by blood, though chance had caused her to live
at Dunripple almost all her life. She had become half a Marrable already, and it might be very
well that she should become a Marrable altogether. Walter was a remarkably handsome man, would
be a baronet, and would have an estate, and might, perhaps, have the enjoyment of the estate
by marrying her earlier than he would were he to marry any one else. Edith Brownlow understood
it all with sufficient clearness. But then she understood also that young women shouldn't give
away their hearts before they are asked for them; and she was quite sure that Walter Marrable
had made no sign of asking for hers. Nevertheless, within her own bosom she did become a little
anxious about Mary Lowther, and she wished that she knew that story.

On the fourth of August Walter Marrable reached Dunripple, and found the house given up almost
entirely to the doctor. Both his uncle and his cousin were very ill. When he was able to obtain
from the doctor information on which he could rely, he learned that Mr. Marrable was in real
danger, but that Sir Gregory's ailment was no more than his usual infirmity heightened by anxiety
on behalf of his son. "Your uncle may live for the next ten years," said the doctor; "but I
do not know what to say about Mr. Marrable." All this time the care and time of the two ladies
were divided between the invalids. Mrs. Brownlow tended her nephew, and Edith, as usual, waited
upon Sir Gregory. In such circumstances it was not extraordinary that Edith Brownlow and Walter
Marrable should be thrown much together,--especially as it was the desire of all concerned
with them that they should become man and wife. Poor Edith was subject to a feeling that everybody
knew that she was expected to fall in love with the man. She thought it probable, too, that
the man himself had been instructed to fall in love with her. This no doubt created a great
difficulty for her, a difficulty which she felt to be heavy and inconvenient;--but it was lessened
by the present condition of the household. When there is illness in a house, the feminine genius
and spirit predominates the male. If the illness be so severe as to cause a sense of danger,
this is so strongly the case that the natural position of the two is changed. Edith, quite
unconscious of the reason, was much less afraid of her proposed lover than she would have been
had there been no going about on tiptoe, no questions asked with bated breath, no great need
for womanly aid.

Walter had been there four days, and was sitting with Edith one evening out on the lawn among
the rhododendrons. When he had found what was the condition of the household, he had offered
to go back at once to his regiment at Birmingham. But Sir Gregory would not hear of it. Sir
Gregory hated the regiment, and had got an idea in his head that his nephew ought not to be
there at all. He was too weak and diffident to do it himself; but if any one would have arranged
it for him, he would have been glad to fix an income for Walter Marrable on condition that
Walter should live at home, and look after the property, and be unto him as a son. But nothing
had been fixed, nothing had been said, and on the day but one following, the captain was to
return to Birmingham. Mrs. Brownlow was with her nephew, and Walter was sitting with Edith
among the rhododendrons, the two having come out of the house together after such a dinner
as is served in a house of invalids. They had become very intimate, but Edith Brownlow had
almost determined that Walter Marrable did not intend to fall in love with her. She had quite
determined that she would not fall in love with him till he did. What she might do in that
case she had not told herself. She was not quite sure. He was very nice,--but she was not quite
sure. One ought to be very fond of a young man, she said to herself, before one falls in love
with him. Nevertheless her mind was by no means set against him. If one can oblige one's friends
one ought, she said, again to herself.

She had brought him out a cup of coffee, and he was sitting in a garden chair with a cigar
in his mouth. They were Walter and Edith to each other, just as though they were cousins. Indeed,
it was necessary that they should be cousins to each other, for the rest of their lives, if
no more.

"Let us drop the Captain and the Miss," he had said himself; "the mischief is in it if you
and I can't suppose ourselves to be related." She had assented cordially, and had called him
Walter without a moment's hesitation. "Edith," he said to her now, after he had sat for a minute
or two with the coffee in his hand; "did you ever hear of a certain cousin of ours, called
Mary Lowther?"

"Oh, dear, yes; she lives with Aunt Sarah at Loring; only Aunt Sarah isn't my aunt, and Miss
Lowther isn't my cousin."

"Just so. She lives at Loring. Edith, I love you so much that I wonder whether I may tell you
the great secret of my life?"

"Of course you may. I love secrets; and I specially love the secrets of those who love me."
She said this with a voice perfectly clear, and a face without a sign of disappointment; but
her little dream had already been dissipated. She knew the secret as well as though it had
been told.

"I was engaged to marry her."

"And you will marry her?"

"It was broken off,--when I thought that I should be forced to go to India. The story is very
long, and very sad. It is my own father who has ruined me. But I will tell it you some day."
Then he told it all, as he was sitting there with his cigar in his hand. Stories may seem to
be very long, and yet be told very quickly.

"But you will go back to her now?" said Edith.

"She has not waited for me."

"What do you mean?"

"They tell me that she is to be married to a--to a--certain Mr. Gilmore."

"Already!"

"He had offered to her twenty times before I ever saw her. She never loved him, and does not now."

"Who has told you this, Captain Marrable?" She had not intended to alter her form of speech,
and when she had done so would have given anything to have called him then by his Christian name.

"My Uncle John."

"I would ask herself."

"I mean to do so. But somehow, treated as I am here, I am bound to tell my uncle of it first.
And I cannot do that while Gregory is so ill."

"I must go up to my uncle now, Walter. And I do so hope she may be true to you. And I do so
hope I may like her. Don't believe anything till she has told you herself." Saying this, Edith
Brownlow returned to the house, and at once put her dream quietly out of her sight. She said
nothing to her mother about it then. It was not necessary that she should tell her mother as yet.

   I write to you myself, especially, instead of getting one
   of the ladies here to do so, because I think it proper
   to tell you how things stand with myself. Everything is
   changed with me since you and I parted because it was
   necessary that I should seek my fortune in India. You
   already know that I have abandoned that idea; and I now
   find that I shall leave the army altogether. My uncle has
   wished it since I first came here, and he now proposes
   that I shall live here permanently. Of course the meaning
   is that I should assume the position of his heir. My
   father, with whom I personally will have no dealing in
   the matter, stands between us. But I do suppose that the
   family affairs will be so arranged that I may feel secure
   that I shall not be turned altogether adrift upon the
   world.

   Dear Mary,--I do not know how to tell you, that as regards
   my future everything now depends on you. They have told me
   that you have accepted an offer from Mr. Gilmore. I know
   no more than this,--that they have told me so. If you will
   tell me also that you mean to be his wife, I will say no
   more. But until you tell me so, I will not believe it. I
   do not think that you can ever love him as you certainly
   once loved me;--and when I think of it, how short a time
   ago that was! I know that I have no right to complain.
   Our separation was my doing as much as yours. But I will
   settle nothing as to my future life till I hear from
   yourself whether or no you will come back to me.

   I shall remain here till after the funeral, which will
   take place on Friday. On Monday I shall go back to
   Birmingham. This is Sunday, and I shall expect to hear
   from you before the week is over. If you bid me, I will be
   with you early next week. If you tell me that my coming
   will be useless,--why, then, I shall care very little what
   happens.

   Yours, with all the love of my heart,

   WALTER MARRABLE.

Luckily for Mary she was alone when she read the letter. Her first idea on reading it was to
think of the words which she had used when she had most ungraciously consented to become the
wife of Harry Gilmore. "Were he so placed that he could afford to marry a poor wife, I should
leave you and go to him." She remembered them accurately. She had made up her mind at the time
that she would say them, thinking that thus he would be driven from her, and that she would
be at rest from his solicitation, from those of her friends, and from the qualms of her own
conscience. He had chosen to claim her in spite of those words,--and now the thing had happened
to the possibility of which she had referred. Poor as she was, Walter Marrable was able to
make her his wife. She held in her hand his letter telling her that it was so. All her heart
was his,--as much now as it had ever been; and it was impossible that she should not go to
him. She had told Mr. Gilmore herself that she could never love again as she loved Walter Marrable.
She had been driven to believe that she could never be his wife, and she had separated herself
from him. She had separated herself from him, and persuaded herself that it would be expedient
for her to become the wife of this other man. But up to this very moment she had never been
able to overcome her horror at the prospect. From day to day she had thought that she must
give it up, even when they were dinning into her ears the tidings that Walter Marrable was
to marry that girl at Dunripple. But that had been a falsehood,--an absolute falsehood. There
had been no such thought in his bosom. He had never been untrue to her. Ah! how much the nobler
of the two had he been!

And yet she had struggled hard to do right,--to think of others more than of herself;--so to
dispose of herself that she might be of some use in the world. And it had come to this! It
was quite impossible now that she should marry Harry Gilmore. There had hitherto been at any
rate an attempt on her part to reconcile herself to that marriage; but now the attempt was
impossible. What right could she have to refuse the man she loved when he told her that all
his happiness depended on her love! She could see it now. With all her desire to do right,
she had done foul wrong in accepting Mr. Gilmore. She had done foul wrong, though she had complied
with the advice of all her friends. It could not but have been wrong, as it had brought her
to this,--her and him. But for the future, she might yet be right,--if she only knew how. That
it would be wrong to marry Harry Gilmore,--to think of marrying him when her heart was so stirred
by the letter which she held in her hand,--of that she was quite sure. She had done the man
an injury for which she could never atone. Of that she was well aware. But the injury was done
and could not now be undone. And had she not told him when he came to her, that she would even
yet return to Walter Marrable if Walter Marrable were able to take her?

She went down stairs, slowly, just before the hour for the children's dinner, and found her
friend, with one or two of the bairns, in the garden. "Janet," she said, "I have had a letter
from Dunripple."

Mrs. Fenwick looked into her face, and saw that it was sad and sorrowful. "What news, Mary?"

"My cousin, Gregory Marrable, is--no more; he died on Sunday morning." This was on the Tuesday.

"You expected it, I suppose, from your aunt's letter?"

"Oh, yes;--it has been sudden at last, it seems."

"And Sir Gregory?"

"He is pretty well. He is getting better."

"I pity him the loss of his son;--poor old man!" Mrs. Fenwick was far too clever not to see
that the serious, solemn aspect of Mary's face was not due altogether to the death of a distant
cousin, whom she herself did not even remember;--but she was too wise, also, to refer to what
she presumed to be Mary's special grief at the moment. Mary was doubtless thinking of the altered
circumstances of her cousin Walter; but it was as well now that she should speak as little
as possible about that cousin. Mrs. Fenwick could not turn altogether to another subject, but
she would, if possible, divert her friend from her present thoughts. You have act for mrs, at one'keep
or have more, by citizenry than you will ideate.

And more excessively it sink ahead into friend. He win't abuse by reconciling to decrease. When
you do state that you are equitable towards what may take himself after
all, you did acknowledge that what do it mean she to do is more afraid.

And your rescript is impossible. I carry that. You ignore it have done then. If you were not be convert
of something after s, it might enough come on and do what they suggest. Incorrect flash have
changed in description. Mrs. Fenwick watched her as she
went, but could not quite understand it. Those tears had not been for a second cousin who had
never been known. And then, during the last few weeks, Mary, in regard to herself, had been
prone to do anything that Mr. Gilmore would advise, as though she could make up by obedience
for the want of that affection which she owed to him. Now, when she was told that she ought
to consult Mr. Gilmore, she flatly refused to do so.

Mary came up the garden a few minutes afterwards, and as she passed towards the house, she
begged to be excused from going into lunch that day. Lord St. George was coming up to lunch
at the vicarage, as will be explained in the next chapter.

CHAPTER LX.

LORD ST. GEORGE IS VERY CUNNING.

Lord St. George began to throw his oil upon the waters in reference to that unfortunate chapel
at Bullhampton a day or two after his interview with his father in the lawyer's chambers. His
father had found himself compelled to yield; had been driven, as it were, by the Fates, to
accord to his son permission to do as his son should think best. There came to be so serious
a trouble in consequence of that terrible mistake of Packer's, that the poor old Marquis was
unable to defend himself from the necessity of yielding. On that day, before he left his son
at Westminster, when their roads lay into the different council-chambers of the state, he had
prayed hard that the oil might not be very oily. But his son would not bate him an inch of
his surrender.

"He is so utterly worthless," the Marquis had said, pleading hard as he spoke of his enemy.

"I'm not quite sure, my lord, that you understand the man," St. George had said. "You hate
him, and no doubt he hates you."

"Horribly!" ejaculated the Marquis.

"You intend to be as good as you know how to be to all those people at Bullhampton?"

"Indeed I do, St. George," said the Marquis, almost with tears in his eyes.

"And I shouldn't wonder if he did, too."

"But look at his life," said the Marquis.

"It isn't always easy to look at a man's life. We are always looking at men's lives, and always
making mistakes. The bishop thinks he is a good sort of fellow, and the bishop isn't the man
to like a debauched, unbelieving, reckless parson, who, according to your ideas, must be leading
a life of open shame and profligacy. I'm inclined to think there must be a mistake."

The unfortunate Marquis groaned deeply as he walked away to the august chamber of the Lords.

These and such like are the troubles that sit heavy on a man's heart. If search for bread,
and meat, and raiment, be set aside, then, beyond that, our happiness or misery here depends
chiefly on success or failure in small things. Though a man when he turns into bed may be sure
that he has unlimited thousands at his command, though all society be open to him, though he
know himself to be esteemed handsome, clever, and fashionable, even though his digestion be
good, and he have no doctor to deny him tobacco, champagne, or made dishes, still, if he be
conscious of failure there where he has striven to succeed, even though it be in the humbling
of an already humble adversary, he will stretch, and roll, and pine,--a wretched being. How
happy is he who can get his fretting done for him by deputy!

Lord St. George wrote to the parson a few days after his interview with his father. He and
Lord Trowbridge occupied the same house in London, and always met at breakfast; but nothing
further was said between them during the remaining days in town upon the subject. Lord St.
George wrote to the parson, and his father had left London for Turnover before Mr. Fenwick's
answer was received.

   MY DEAR SIR,--(Lord St. George had said,)--My father
   has put into my hands your letter about the dissenting
   chapel at Bullhampton. It seems to me, that he has made a
   mistake, and that you are very angry. Couldn't we arrange
   this little matter without fighting? There is not a
   landlord in England more desirous of doing good to his
   tenants than my father; and I am quite willing to believe
   that there is not an incumbent in England more desirous of
   doing good to his parishioners than you. I leave London
   for Wiltshire on Saturday the 11th. If you will meet me I
   will drive over to Bullhampton on Monday the 13th.

   Yours truly,

   ST. GEORGE.

   No doubt you'll agree with me in thinking that internecine
   fighting in a parish between the landlord and the
   clergyman cannot be for the good of the people.

Thus it was that Lord St. George began to throw his oil upon the waters.

It may be a doubt whether it should be ascribed to Mr. Fenwick as a weakness or a strength
that, though he was very susceptible of anger, and though he could maintain his anger at glowing
heat as long as fighting continued, it would all evaporate and leave him harmless as a dove
at the first glimpse of an olive-branch. "thank Elysium!" he consulted away gilmore, miss, was digest,
confront him was, she appear cold ideas, hesitating, at he. By self-respect was altered on
region.

"you desire to seat but me?" he inquire so. As boy was not blush.

"the cousin," she state, and halt. He expect. "i didn't anticipate--" i begin, and have really
you see that she was not be uncontrollably amused circumstances.

"i didn't go-- her asked." He understand so.

"you said to turn she consult you know from ministrant.'present.

He travel away to-time was altered as holiday.'thousand. Can assist

And appear as him were, has scare, not cognize what to do. Tiredly: "i desire to understand if
he have-- and could consult steady-- it'he consulted mho he!" she
bumble, the engineering was not altogether so mourning but gilmore.

To she asked, but possible things.

But countenance was please uncomfortable circumstances. "if i'thousand

now would be instant." The Mr. That was covered. It sink she divert
into thinking about seat and i sobbed today, and do he stand about
her, and i consulted, but was not surprised. That warm, and that he
had promise, to ideas was indubitably have immerse into engineering was
perchance good present. That boom was nigher, mumble frivolous threatenings;
the antechamber was right; the gas was unsure regretful thoughts
like cousin; the homo was altered of circumstances, he give soma
and i should know the woman asked sobbing again, she would merely
excessively.

"involuntarily
divert you said to maine." It was acknowledged that it was ugly, misplaced,
uncomfortable, detestable to the eye, and ear, and general feeling,--except in so far as it
might suit the wants of people who were not sufficiently educated to enjoy the higher tone,
and more elaborate language of the Church of England services. It was thus that they spoke
to each other, quite in an æsthetic manner.

Lord St. George had said as he entered the chapel, that it must come down as a matter of course;
and the Vicar had suggested that there need be no hurry.

"They tell me that it must be removed some day," said the Vicar, "but as I am not likely to
leave the parish, nobody need start the matter for a year or two." Lord St. George was declaring
that advantage could not be taken of such a concession on Mr. Fenwick's part, when a third
person entered the building, and walked towards them with a quick step.

"Here is Mr. Puddleham, the minister," said Mr. Fenwick; and the future lord of Bullhampton
was introduced to the present owner of the pulpit under which they were standing.

"My lord," said the minister, "I am proud, indeed, to have the honour of meeting your lordship
in our new chapel, and of expressing to your lordship the high sense entertained by me and
my congregation of your noble father's munificent liberality to us in the matter of the land."

In saying this Mr. Puddleham never once turned his face upon the Vicar. He presumed himself
at the present moment to be at feud with the Vicar in most deadly degree. Though the Vicar
would occasionally accost him in the village, he always answered the Vicar as though they two
were enemies. He had bowed when he came up the chapel, but he had bowed to the stranger. If
the Vicar took any of that courtesy to himself, that was not his fault.

"I'm afraid we were a little too quick there," said Lord St. George.

"I hope not, my lord; I hope not. I have heard a rumour; but I have inquired. I have inquired,
and--"

"The truth is, Mr. Puddleham, that we are standing on Mr. Fenwick's private ground this moment."

"You are quite welcome to the use of it, Mr. Puddleham," said the Vicar. Mr. Puddleham assumed
a look of dignity, and frowned. He could not even yet believe that his friend the Marquis had
made so fatal a mistake.

"We must build you another chapel,--that will be about the long and short of it, Mr. Puddleham."

"My lord, I should think there must be some--mistake. Some error must have crept in somewhere,
my lord. I have made inquiry--"

"It has been a very big error," said Lord St. George, "and it has crept into Mr. Fenwick's
glebe in a very palpable form. There is no use in discussing it, Mr. Puddleham."

"And why didn't the reverend gentleman claim the ground when the works were commenced?" demanded
the indignant minister, turning now for the first time to the Vicar, and doing so with a visage
full of wrath, and a graceful uplifting of his right hand.

"The reverend gentleman was very ignorant of matters with which he ought to have been better
acquainted," said Mr. Fenwick himself.

"Very ignorant, indeed," said Mr. Puddleham. "My lord, I am inclined to think that we can assert
our right to this chapel and maintain it. My lord, I am of opinion that the whole hierarchy
of the Episcopal Established Church in England cannot expel us. My lord, who will be the man
to move the first brick from this sacred edifice?" And Mr. Puddleham pointed up to the pulpit
as though he knew well where that brick was ever to be found when duty required its presence.
"My lord, I would propose that nothing should be done; and then let us see who will attempt
to close this chapel door against the lambs of the Lord who come here for pasture in their need."

"The lambs shall have pasture and shall have their pastor," said St. George, laughing. "We'll
move this chapel to ground that is our own, and make everything as right as a trivet for you.
You don't want to intrude, I'm sure."

Mr. Puddleham's eloquence was by no means exhausted; but at last, when they had left the chapel,
and the ground immediately around the chapel which Mr. Puddleham would insist upon regarding
as his own, they did manage to shake him off.

"And now, Mr. Fenwick," said Lord St. George, in his determined purpose to throw oil upon the
waters, "what is this unfortunate quarrel between you and my father?"

"You had better ask him that, my lord."

"I have asked him, of course,--and of course he has no answer to make. No doubt you intended
to enrage him when you wrote him that letter which he showed me."

"Certainly I did."

"I hardly see how good is to be done by angering an old man who stands high in the world's esteem."

"Had he not stood high, my lord, I should probably have passed him by."

"I can understand all that,--that one man should be a mark for another's scorn because he is
a Marquis, and wealthy. But what I can't understand is, that such a one as you should think
that good can come from it."

"Do you know what your father has said of me?"

"I've no doubt you both say very hard things of each other."

"I never said an evil thing of him behind his back that I have not said as strongly to his
face," said Mr. Fenwick, with much of indignation in his tone.

"Do you really think that that mitigates the injury done to my father?" said Lord St. George.

"Do you know that he has complained of me to the bishop?"

"Yes,--and the bishop took your part."

"No thanks to your father, Lord St. George. Do you know that he has accused me publicly of
the grossest vices; that he has,--that he has,--that he has--. There is nothing so bad that
he hasn't said it of me."

"Upon my word, I think you are even with him, Mr. Fenwick, I do indeed."

"What I have said, I have said to his face. I have made no accusation against him. Come, my
lord, I am willing enough to let bygones be bygones. If Lord Trowbridge will condescend to
say that he will drop all animosity to me, I will forgive him the injuries he has done me.
But I cannot admit myself to have been wrong."

"I never knew any man who would," said Lord St. George.

"If the Marquis will put out his hand to me, I will accept it," said the Vicar.

"Allow me to do so on his behalf," said the son.

And thus the quarrel was presumed to be healed. Lord St. George went to the inn for his horse,
and the Vicar, as he walked across to the vicarage, felt that he had been--done. This young
lord had been very clever,--and had treated the quarrel as though on even terms, as if the
offences on each side had been equal. And yet the Vicar knew very well that he had been right,--right
without a single slip,--right from the beginning to the end. "He has been clever," he said
to himself, "and he shall have the advantage of his cleverness." Then he resolved that as far
as he was concerned the quarrel should in truth be over.

CHAPTER LXI.

MARY LOWTHER'S TREACHERY.

While the Vicar was listening to the eloquence of Mr. Puddleham in the chapel, and was being
cozened out of his just indignation by Lord St. George, a terrible scene was going on in the
drawing-room of the vicarage. Mary Lowther, as the reader knows, had declared that she would
wear mourning for her distant cousin, and had declined to appear at lunch before Lord St. George.
Mrs. Fenwick, putting these things together, knew that much was the matter, but she did not
know how much. She did not as yet anticipate the terrible state of things which was to be made
known to her that afternoon.

Mary was quite aware that the thing must be settled. In the first place she must answer Captain
Marrable's letter. And then it was her bounden duty to let Mr. Gilmore know her mind as soon
as she knew it herself. It might be easy enough for her to write to Walter Marrable. That which
she had to say to him would be pleasant enough in the saying. But that could not be said till
the other thing should be unsaid. And how was that unsaying to be accomplished? Nothing could
be done without the aid of Mrs. Fenwick; and now she was afraid of Mrs. Fenwick,--as the guilty
are always afraid of those who will have to judge their guilt. While the children were at dinner,
and while the lord was sitting at lunch, she remained up in her own room. From her window she
could see the two men walking across the vicarage grounds towards the chapel, and she knew
that her friend would be alone. Her story must be told to Mrs. Fenwick, and to Mrs. Fenwick
only. It would be impossible for her to speak of her determination before the Vicar till he
should have received a first notice of it from his wife. And there certainly must be no delay.
The men were hardly out of sight before she had resolved to go down at once. She looked at
herself in the glass, and spunged the mark of tears from her eyes, and smoothed her hair, and
then descended. She never before had felt so much in fear of her friend; and yet it was her
friend who was mainly the cause of this mischief which surrounded her, and who had persuaded
her to evil. At Janet Fenwick's instance she had undertaken to marry a man whom she did not
love; and yet she feared to go to Janet Fenwick with the story of her repentance. Why not indignantly
demand of her friend assistance in extricating herself from the injury which that friend had
brought upon her?

She found Mrs. Fenwick with the children in the little breakfast parlour to which they had
been banished by the coming of Lord St. George. "Janet," she said, "come and take a turn with
me in the garden." It was now the middle of August, and life at the vicarage was spent almost
as much out of doors as within. The ladies went about with parasols, and would carry their
hats hanging in their hands. There was no delay therefore, and the two were on the gravel-path
almost as soon as Mary's request was made. "I did not show you my letter from Dunripple," she
said, putting her hand into her pocket; "but I might as well do so now. You will have to read it."

She took out the document, but did not at once hand it to her companion. "Is there anything
wrong, Mary?" said Mrs. Fenwick.

"Wrong. Yes;--very, very wrong. Janet, it is no use your talking to me. I have quite made up
my mind. I cannot and I will not marry Mr. Gilmore."

"Mary, this is insanity."

"You may say what you please, but I am determined. I cannot and I will not. Will you help me
out of my difficulty?"

"Certainly not in the way you mean;--certainly not. It cannot be either for your good or for
his. After what has passed, how on earth could you bring yourself to make such a proposition
to him?"

"I do not know; that is what I feel the most. I do not know how I shall tell him. But he must
be told. I thought that perhaps Mr. Fenwick would do it."

"I am quite sure he will do nothing of the kind. Think of it, Mary. How can you bring yourself
to be so false to a man?"

"I have not been false to him. I have been false to myself, but never to him. I told him how
it was. When you drove me on--"

"Drove you on, Mary?"

"I do not mean to be ungrateful, or to say hard things; but when you made me feel that if he
were satisfied I also might put up with it, I told him that I could never love him. I told
him that I did love, and ever should love, Walter Marrable. I told him that I had nothing--nothing--nothing
to give him. But he would take no answer but the one; and I did--I did give it him. I know
I did; and I have never had a moment of happiness since. And now has come this letter. Janet,
do not be cruel to me. Do not speak to me as though everything must be stern and hard and cruel."
Then she handed up the letter, and Mrs. Fenwick read it as they walked.

"And is he to be made a tool, because the other man has changed his mind?" said Mrs. Fenwick.

"Walter has never changed his mind."

"His plans, then. It comes to the same thing. Do you know that you will have to answer for
his life, or for his reason? Have you not learned yet to understand the constancy of his nature?"

"Is it my fault that he should be constant? I told him when he offered to me that if Walter
were to come back to me and ask me again, I should go to him in spite of any promise that I
had made. I said so as plain as I am saying this to you."

"I am quite sure that he did not understand it so."

"Janet, indeed he did."

"No man would have submitted himself to an engagement with such a condition. It is quite impossible.
What! Mr. Gilmore knew when you took him that if this gentleman should choose to change his
mind at any moment before you were actually married, you would walk off and go back to him!"

"I told him so, Janet. He will not deny that I told him so. When I told him so, I was sure
that he would have declined such an engagement. But he did not, and I had no way of escape.
Janet, if you could know what I have been suffering, you would not be cruel to me. Think what
it would have been to you to have to marry a man you did not love, and to break the heart of
one you did love. Of course Mr. Gilmore is your friend."

"He is our friend!"

"And, of course, you do not care for Captain Marrable?"

"I never even saw him."

"But you might put yourself in my place, and judge fairly between us. There has not been a
thought or a feeling in my heart concealed from you since first all this began. You have known
that I have never loved your friend."

"I know that, after full consideration, you have accepted him; and I know also, that he is
a man who will devote his whole life to make you happy."

"It can never be. You may as well believe me. If you will not help me, nor Mr. Fenwick, I must
tell him myself;--or I must write to him and leave the place suddenly. I know that I have behaved
badly. I have tried to do right, but I have done wrong. When I came here I was very unhappy.
How could I help being unhappy when I had lost all that I cared for in the world? Then you
told me that I might at any rate be of some use to some one, by marrying your friend. You do
not know how I strove to make myself fond of him! And then, at last, when the time came that
I had to answer him, I thought that I would tell him everything. I thought that if I told him
the truth he would see that we had better be apart. But when I told him, leaving him, as I
imagined, no choice but to reject me,--he chose to take me. Well, Janet; at any rate, then,
as I was taught to believe, there was no one to be ruined by this,--no one to be broken on
the wheel,--but myself: and I thought that if I struggled, I might so do my duty that he might
be satisfied. I see that I was wrong, but you should not rebuke me for it. I had tried to do
as you bade me. But I did tell him that if ever this thing happened I should leave him. It
has happened, and I must leave him." Mrs. Fenwick had let her speak on without interrupting
her, intending when she had finished, to say definitely, that they at the vicarage could not
make themselves parties to any treason towards Mr. Gilmore; but when Mary had come to the end
of her story her friend's heart was softened towards her. She walked silently along the path,
refraining at any rate from those bitter arguments with which she had at first thought to confound
Mary in her treachery. "I do think you love me," said Mary.

"Indeed I love you."

"Then help me; do help me. I will go on my knees to him to beg his pardon."

"I do not know what to say to it. Begging his pardon will be of no avail. As for myself, I
should not dare to tell him. We used to think, when he was hopeless before, that dwelling on
it all would drive him to some absolute madness. And it will be worse now. Of course it will
be worse."

"What am I to do?" Mary paused a moment, and then added, sharply,--"There is one thing I will
not do; I will not go to the altar and become his wife."

"I suppose I had better tell Frank," said Mrs. Fenwick, after another pause.

This was, of course, what Mary Lowther desired, but she begged for and obtained permission
not to see the Vicar herself that evening. She would keep her own room that night, and meet
him the next morning before prayers as best she might.

When the Vicar came back to the house, his mind was so full of the chapel, and Lord St. George,
and the admirable manner in which he had been cajoled out of his wrath without the slightest
admission on the part of the lord that his father had ever been wrong,--his thoughts were so
occupied with all this, and with Mr. Puddleham's oratory, that he did not at first give his
wife an opportunity of telling Mary Lowther's story.

"We shall all of us have to go over to Turnover next week," he said.

"You may go. I won't."

"And I shouldn't wonder if the Marquis were to offer me a better living, so that I might be
close to him. We are to be the lamb and the wolf sitting down together."

"And which is to be the lamb?"

"That does not matter. But the worst of it is, Puddleham won't come and be a lamb too. Here
am I, who have suffered pretty nearly as much as St. Paul, have forgiven all my enemies all
round, and shaken hands with the Marquis by proxy, while Puddleham has been man enough to maintain
the dignity of his indignation. The truth is, that the possession of a grievance is the one
state of human blessedness. As long as the chapel was there, malgré moi, I could revel in my
wrong. It turns out now that I can send poor Puddleham adrift to-morrow, and he immediately
becomes the hero of the hour. I wish your brother-in-law had not been so officious in finding
it all out."

Mrs. Fenwick postponed her story till the evening.

Again,"

.
 The Vicar muttered some word of assent, and then the miller went on.
"You knows, of course, as how she be back here at the mill?"

"Certainly I do. I've seen her more than once."

"Muster Fenwick, I don't suppose as any one as asn't tried it knows what it is. I hopes you
mayn't never know it; nor it ain't likely. Muster Fenwick, I'd sooner see her dead body stretched
afore me,--and I loved her a'most as well as any father ever loved his da'ter,--I'd sooner
a see'd her brought home to the door stiff and stark than know her to be the thing she is."
His hesitation had now given way to emphasis, and he raised his hand as he spoke. The Vicar
caught it and held it in his own, and strove to find some word to say as the old man paused
in his speech. But to Jacob Brattle it was hard for a clergyman to find any word to say on
such an occasion. Of what use could it be to preach of repentance to one who believed nothing;
or to tell of the opportunity which forgiveness by an earthly parent might afford to the sinner
of obtaining lasting forgiveness elsewhere? But let him have said what he might, the miller
would not have listened. He was full of that which lay upon his own heart. "If they only know'd
what them as cares for 'em 'd has to bear, maybe they'd think a little. But it ain't natural
they should know, Muster Fenwick, and one's a'most tempted to say that a man 'd better have
no child at all."

"Think of your son George, Mr. Brattle, and of Mrs. Jay."

"What's them to me? He sends the girl a twenty-pun'-note, and I wish he'd a kep' it. As for
t'other, she wouldn't let the girl inside her door! It's here she has to come."

"What comfort would you have, Mr. Brattle, without Fanny?"

"Fanny! I'm not saying nothing against Fanny. Not but what she hadn't no business to let the
girl into the house in the middle of the night without saying a word to me."

"Would you have had her leave her sister outside in the cold and damp all night?"

"Why didn't she come and ax? All the same, I ain't a saying nowt again Fanny. But, Muster Fenwick,
if you ever come to have one foot bad o' the gout, it won't make you right to know that the
other ain't got it. Y'll have the pain a gnawing of you from the bad foot till you clean forget
all the rest o' your body. It's so with me, I knows."

"What can I say to you, Mr. Brattle? I do feel for you. I do,--I do."

"Not a doubt on it, Muster Fenwick. They all on 'em feels for me. They all on 'em knows as
how I'm bruised and mangled a'most as though I'd fallen through into that water-wheel. There
ain't one in all Bull'ompton as don't know as Jacob Brattle is a broken man along of his da'ter
that is a--"

"Silence, Mr. Brattle. You shall not say it. She is not that;--at any rate not now. Have you
no knowledge that sin may be left behind and deserted as well as virtue?"

"It ain't easy to leave disgrace behind, any ways. For ought I knows a girl may be made right
arter a while; but as for her father, nothing 'll ever make him right again. It's in here,
Muster Fenwick,--in here. There's things as is hard on us; but when they comes one can't send
'em away just because they is hardest of all to bear. I'd a put up with aught, only this, and
defied all Bull'ompton to say as it broke me;--but I'm about broke now. If I hadn't more nor
a crust at home, nor a decent coat to my back, I'd a looked 'em all square in the face as ever
I did. But I can't look no man square in the face now;--and as for other folk's girls, I can't
bear 'em near me,--no how. They makes me think of my own." Fenwick had now turned his back
to the miller, in order that he might wipe away his tears without showing them. "I'm thinking
of her always, Muster Fenwick;--day and night. When the mill's agoing, it's all the same. It's
just as though there warn't nothing else in the whole world as I minded to think on. I've been
a man all my life, Muster Fenwick; and now I ain't a man no more."

Our friend the Vicar never before felt himself so utterly unable to administer comfort in affliction.
There was nothing on which he could take hold. He could tell the man, no doubt, that beyond
all this there might be everlasting joy, not only for him, but for him and the girl together;--joy
which would be sullied by no touch of disgrace. But there was a stubborn strength in the infidelity
of this old Pagan which was utterly impervious to any adjuration on that side. That which he
saw and knew and felt, he would believe; but he would believe nothing else. He knew now that
he was wounded and sore and wretched, and he understood the cause. He knew that he must bear
his misery to the last, and he struggled to make his back broad for the load. But even the
desire for ease, which is natural to all men, would not make him flinch in his infidelity.
As he would not believe when things went well with him, and when the comfort of hope for the
future was not imperatively needed for his daily solace,--so would he not believe now, when
his need for such comfort was so pressing.

The upshot of it all was, that the miller thought that he would take his own daughter into
Salisbury, and was desirous of breaking the matter in this way to the friend of his family.
The Vicar, of course, applauded him much. Indeed, he applauded too much;--for the miller turned
on him and declared that he was by no means certain that he was doing right. And when the Vicar
asked him to be gentle with the girl, he turned upon him again.

"Why ain't she been gentle along of me? I hates such gentility, Muster Fenwick. I'll be honest
with her, any way." But he thought better of it before he let the Vicar go. "I shan't do her
no hurt, Muster Fenwick. Bad as she's been, she's my own flesh and blood still."

After what he had heard, Mr. Fenwick declined going into the mill-house, and returned home
without seeing Mrs. Brattle and her daughters. The miller's determination should be told by
himself; and the Vicar felt that he could hardly keep the secret were he now to see the women.

CHAPTER LXIV.

IF I WERE YOUR SISTER!

Mr. Gilmore in his last words to his friend Fenwick, declared that he would not accept the
message which the Vicar delivered to him as the sufficient expression of Mary's decision. He
would see Mary Lowther herself, and force her to confess her own treachery face to face with
him,--to confess it or else to deny it. So much she could not refuse to grant him. Fenwick
had indeed said that as long as the young lady was his guest she must be allowed to please
herself as to whom she would see or not see. Gilmore should not be encouraged to force himself
upon her at the vicarage. But the Squire was quite sure that so much as that must be granted
to him. It was impossible that even Mary Lowther should refuse to see him after what had passed
between them. And then, as he walked about his own fields, thinking of it all, he allowed himself
to feel a certain amount of hope that after all she might be made to marry him. His love for
her had not dwindled,--or rather his desire to call her his own, and to make her his wife;
but it had taken an altered form out of which all its native tenderness had been pressed by
the usage to which he had been subjected. It was his honour rather than his love that he now
desired to satisfy. All those who knew him best were aware that he had set his heart upon this
marriage, and it was necessary to him that he should show them that he was not to be disappointed.
Mary's conduct to him from the day on which she had first engaged herself to him had been of
such a kind as naturally to mar his tenderness and to banish from him all those prettinesses
of courtship in which he would have indulged as pleasantly as any other man. She had told him
in so many words that she intended to marry him without loving him, and on these terms he had
accepted her. But in doing so he had unconsciously flattered himself that she would be better
than her words,--that as she submitted herself to him as his affianced bride she would gradually
become soft and loving in his hands. She had, if possible, been harder to him even than her
words. She had made him understand thoroughly that his presence was not a joy to her, and that
her engagement to him was a burden on her which she had taken on her shoulders simply because
the romance of her life had been nipped in the bud in reference to the man whom she did love.
Still he had persevered. He had set his heart sturdily on marrying this girl, and marry her
he would, if, after any fashion, such marriage should come within his power. Mrs. Fenwick,
by whose judgment and affection he had been swayed through all this matter, had told him again
and again, that such a girl as Mary Lowther must love her husband,--if her husband loved her
and treated her with tenderness. "I think I can answer for myself," Gilmore had once replied,
and his friend had thoroughly believed in him. Trusting to the assurance he had persevered;
he had persevered even when his trust in that assurance had been weakened by the girl's hardness.
Anything would be better than breaking from an engagement on which he had so long rested all
his hopes of happiness. She was pledged to be his wife; and, that being so, he could reform
his gardens and decorate his house, and employ himself about his place with some amount of
satisfaction. He had at least a purpose in his life. Then by degrees there grew upon him a
fear that she still meant to escape from him, and he swore to himself,--without any tenderness,--that
this should not be so. Let her once be his wife and she should be treated with all consideration,--with
all affection, if she would accept it; but she should not make a fool of him now. Then the
Vicar had come with his message, and he had been simply told that the engagement between them
was over!

Of course he would see her,--and that at once. As soon as Fenwick had left him, he went with
rapid steps over his whole place, and set the men again upon their work. This took place on
a Wednesday, and the men should be continued at their work, at any rate, till Saturday. He
explained this clearly to Ambrose, his gardener, and to the foreman in the house.

"It may be," said he to Ambrose, "that I shall change my mind altogether about the place;--but
as I am still in doubt, let everything go on till Saturday."

Of course they all knew why it was that the conduct of the Squire was so like the conduct of
a madman.

He sent down a note to Mary Lowther that evening.

   DEAR MARY,

   I have seen Fenwick, and of course I must see you. Will
   you name an hour for to-morrow morning?

   Yours, H. G.

When Mary read this, which she did as they were sitting on the lawn after dinner, she did not
hesitate for a moment. Hardly a word had been said to her by Fenwick, or his wife, since his
return from the Privets. They did not wish to show themselves to be angry with her, but they
found conversation to be almost impossible. "You have told him?" Mary had asked. "Yes, I have
told him," the Vicar had replied; and that had been nearly all. In the course of the afternoon
she had hinted to Janet Fenwick that she thought she had better leave Bullhampton. "Not quite
yet, dear," Mrs. Fenwick had said, and Mary had been afraid to urge her request.

"Shall I name eleven to-morrow?" she said, as she handed the Squire's note to Mrs. Fenwick.
Mrs. Fenwick and the Vicar both assented, and then she went in and wrote her answer.

   I will be at home at the vicarage at eleven.--M. L.

She would have given much to escape what was coming, but she had not expected to escape it.

The next morning after breakfast Fenwick himself went away. "I've had more than enough of it,"
he said, to his wife, "and I won't be near them."

Mrs. Fenwick was with her friend up to the moment at which the bell was heard at the front
door. There was no coming up across the lawn now.

"Dear Janet," Mary said, when they were alone, "how I wish that I had never come to trouble
you here at the vicarage!"

Mrs. Fenwick was not without a feeling that much of all this unhappiness had come from her
own persistency on behalf of her husband's friend, and thought that some expression was due
from her to Mary to that effect. "You are not to suppose that we are angry with you," she said,
putting her arm round Mary's waist.

"Pray,--pray do not be angry with me."

"The fault has been too much ours for that. We should have left this alone, and not have pressed
it. We have meant it for the best, dear."

"And I have meant to do right;--but, Janet, it is so hard to do right."

When the ring at the door was heard, Mrs. Fenwick met Harry Gilmore in the hall, and told him
that he would find Mary in the drawing-room. She pressed his hand warmly as she looked into
his face, but he spoke no word as he passed on to the room which she had just left. Mary was
standing in the middle of the floor, half-way between the window and the door, to receive him.
When she heard the door-bell she put her hand to her heart, and there she held it till he was
approaching; but then she dropped it and stood without support, with her face upraised to meet
him. He came up to her very quickly and took her by the hand. "Mary," he said, "I am not to
believe this message that has been sent to me. I do not believe it. I will not believe it.
I will not accept it. It is out of the question;--quite out of the question. It shall be withdrawn,
and nothing more shall be said about it."

"That cannot be, Mr. Gilmore."

"What cannot be? I say that it must be. You cannot deny, Mary, that you are betrothed to me
as my wife. Are such betrothals to be nothing? Are promises to go for nothing because there
has been no ceremony? You might as well come and tell me that you would leave me even though
you were my wife."

"But I am not your wife."

"What does it mean? Have I not been patient with you? Have I been hard to you, or cruel? Have
you heard anything of me that is to my discredit?" She shook her head, eagerly. "Then what
does it mean? Are you aware that you are proposing to yourself to make an utter wreck of me--to
send me adrift upon the world without a purpose or a hope? What have I done to deserve such
treatment?"

He pleaded his cause very well,--better than she had ever heard him plead a cause before. He
held her still by the hand, not with a grasp of love, but with a retention which implied his
will that she should not pass away from out of his power. He looked her full in the face, and
she did not quail before his eyes. Nevertheless she would have given the world to have been
elsewhere, and to have been free from the necessity of answering him. She had been fortifying
herself throughout the morning with self-expressed protests that on no account would she yield,
whether she had been right before or wrong;--of this she was convinced, that she must be right
now to save herself from a marriage that was so distasteful to her.

"You have deserved nothing but good at my hands," she said.

"And is this good that you are doing to me?"

"Yes,--certainly. It is the best that I know how to do now."

"Why is it to be done now? What is it that has changed you?"

She withdrew her hand from him, and waited a while before she answered. It was necessary that
she should tell him all the tidings that had been conveyed to her in the letter which she had
received from her cousin Walter; but in order that he should perfectly understand them and
be made to know their force upon herself she must remind him of the stipulation which she had
made when she consented to her engagement. But how could she speak words which would seem to
him to be spoken only to remind him of the abjectness of his submission to her?

"I was broken-hearted when I came here," she said.

"And therefore you would leave me broken-hearted now."

"You should spare me, Mr. Gilmore. You remember what I told you. I loved my cousin Walter entirely.
I did not hide it from you. I begged you to leave me because it was so. I told you that my
heart would not change. When I said so, I thought that you would--desist."

"I am to be punished, then, for having been too true to you?"

"I will not defend myself for accepting you at last. But you must remember that when I did
so I said that I should go--back--to him, if he could take me."

"And you are going back to him?"

"If he will have me."

"You can stand there and look me in the face and tell me that you are false as that! You can
confess to me that you will change like a weathercock;--be his one day, and then mine, and
his again the next! You can own that you give yourself about first to one man, and then to
another, just as may suit you at the moment! I would not have believed it of any woman. When
you tell it me of yourself, I begin to think that I have been wrong all through in my ideas
of a woman's character."

The time had now come in which she must indeed speak up. And speech seemed to be easier with
her now that he had allowed himself to express his anger. He had expressed more than his anger.
He had dared to shower his scorn upon her, and the pelting of the storm gave her courage. "You
are unjust upon me, Mr. Gilmore,--unjust and cruel. You know in your heart that I have not
changed."

"Were you not betrothed to me?"

"I was;--but in what way? Have I told you any untruth? Have I concealed anything? When I accepted
you, did I not explain to you how and why it was so,--against my own wish, against my own judgment,--because
then I had ceased to care what became of me. I do care now. I care very much."

"And you think that is justice to me?"

"If you will bandy accusations with me, why did you accept me when I told you that I could
not love you? But, indeed, indeed, I would not say a word to displease you, if you would only
spare me. We were both wrong; but the wrong must now be put right. You would not wish to take
me for your wife when I tell you that my heart is full of affection for another man. Then,
when I yielded, I was struggling to cure that as a great evil. Now I welcome it as the sweetest
blessing of my life. If I were your sister, what would you have me do?"

He stood silent for a moment, and then the colour rose to his forehead as he answered her.
"If you were my sister, my ears would tingle with shame when your name was mentioned in my
presence."

The blood rushed also over her face, suffusing her whole countenance, forehead and all, and
fire flashed from her eyes, and her lips were parted, and even her nostrils seemed to swell
with anger. She looked full into his face for a second, and then she turned and walked speechless
away from him. When the handle of the door was in her hand, she turned again to address him.
"Mr. Gilmore," she said, "I will never willingly speak to you again." Then the door was opened
and closed behind her before a word had escaped from his lips.

He knew that he had insulted her. He knew that he had uttered words so hard, that it might
be doubted whether, under any circumstances, they could be justified from a gentleman to a
lady. And certainly he had not intended to insult her as he was coming down to the vicarage.
As far as any settled purpose had been formed in his mind, he had meant to force her back to
her engagement with himself, by showing to her how manifest would be her injustice, and how
great her treachery, if she persisted in leaving him. But he knew her character well enough
to be aware that any word of insult addressed to her as a woman, would create offence which
she herself would be unable to quell. But his anger had got the better of his judgment, and
when the suggestion was made to him of a sister of his own, he took the opportunity which was
offered to him of hitting her with all his force. She had felt the blow, and had determined
that she would never encounter another.

He was left alone, and he must retreat. He waited a while, thinking that perhaps Mrs. Fenwick
or the Vicar would come to him; but nobody came. The window of the room was open, and it was
easy for him to leave the house by the garden. But as he prepared to do so, his eye caught
the writing materials on a side table, and he sat down and addressed a note to Mrs. Fenwick.
"Tell Mary," he said, "that in a matter which to me is of life and death, I was forced to speak
plainly. Tell her, also, that if she will be my wife, I know well that I shall never have to
blush for a deed of hers,--or for a word,--or for a thought.--H. G." Then he went out on to
the lawn, and returned home by the path at the back of the church farm.

He had left the vicarage, making another offer for the girl's hand, as it were, with his last
gasp. But as he went, he told himself that it was impossible that it should be accepted. Every
chance had now gone from him, and he must look his condition in the face as best he could.
It had been bad enough with him before, when no hope had ever been held out to him; when the
answers of the girl he loved had always been adverse to him; when no one had been told that
she was to be his bride. Even then the gnawing sense of disappointment and of failure,--just
there, when only he cared for success,--had been more than he could endure without derangement
of the outer tranquillity of his life. Even then he had been unable so to live that men should
not know that his sorrow had disturbed him. When he had gone to Loring, travelling with a forlorn
hope into the neighbourhood of the girl he loved, he had himself been aware that he had lacked
strength to control himself in his misfortune. But if his state then had been grievous, what
must it be now? It had been told to all the world around him that he had at last won his bride,
and he had proceeded, as do jolly thriving bridegrooms, to make his house ready for her reception.
Doubting nothing he had mingled her wishes, her tastes, his thoughts of her, with every action
of his life. He had prepared jewels for her, and decorated chambers, and laid out pleasure
gardens. He was a man, simple in his own habits, and not given to squandering his means; but
now, at this one moment of his life, when everything was to be done for the delectation of
her who was to be his life's companion, he could afford to let prudence go by the board. True
that his pleasure in doing this had been sorely marred by her coldness, by her indifference,
even by her self-abnegation; but he had continued to buoy himself up with the idea that all
would come right when she should be his wife. Now she had told him that she would never willingly
speak to him again,--and he believed her.

He went up to his house, and into his bedroom, and then he sat thinking of it all. And as he
thought he heard the voices and the tools of the men at their work; and knew that things were
being done which, for him, would never be of avail. He remained there for a couple of hours
without moving. Then he got up and gave the housekeeper instructions to pack up his portmanteau,
and the groom orders to bring his gig to the door. "He was going away," he said, and his letters
were to be addressed to his club in London. That afternoon he drove himself into Salisbury
that he might catch the evening express train up, and that night he slept at a hotel in London.

CHAPTER LXV.

MARY LOWTHER LEAVES BULLHAMPTON.

It was considerably past one o'clock, and the children's dinner was upon the table in the dining
parlour before anyone in the vicarage had seen Mary Lowther since the departure of the Squire.
When she left Mr. Gilmore, she had gone to her own room, and no one had disturbed her. As the
children were being seated, Fenwick returned, and his wife put into his hand the note which
Gilmore had left for her.

"What passed between them?" he asked in a whisper.

His wife shook her head. "I have not seen her," she said, "but he talks of speaking plainly,
and I suppose it was bitter enough."

"He can be very bitter if he's driven hard," said the Vicar; "and he has been driven very hard,"
he added, after a while.

As soon as the children had eaten their dinner, Mrs. Fenwick went up to Mary's room with the
Squire's note in her hand. She knocked, and was at once admitted, and she found Mary sitting
at her writing-desk.

"Will you not come to lunch, Mary?"

"Yes,--if I ought. I suppose I might not have a cup of tea brought up here?"

"You shall have whatever you like,--here or anywhere else, as far as the vicarage goes. What
did he say to you this morning?"

"It is of no use that I should tell you, Janet."

"You did not yield to him, then?"

"Certainly, I did not. Certainly I never shall yield to him. Dear Janet, pray take that as
a certainty. Let me make you sure at any rate of that. He must be sure of it himself."

"Here is his note to me, written, I suppose, after you left him." Mary took the scrap of paper
from her hand and read it. "He is not sure, you see," continued Mrs. Fenwick. "He has written
to me, and I suppose that I must answer him."

"He shall certainly never have to blush for me as his wife," said Mary. But she would not tell
her friend of the hard words that had been said to her. She understood well the allusion in
Mr. Gilmore's note, but she would not explain it. She had determined, as she thought about
it in her solitude, that it would be better that she should never repeat to anyone the cruel
words which her lover had spoken to her. Doubtless he had received provocation. All his anger,
as well as all his suffering, had come from a constancy in his love for her, which was unsurpassed,
if not unequalled, in all that she had read of among men. He had been willing to accept her
on conditions most humiliating to himself; and had then been told, that, even with those conditions,
he was not to have her. She was bound to forgive him almost any offence that he could bestow
upon her. He had spoken to her in his wrath words which she thought to be not only cruel but
unmanly. She had told him that she would never speak willingly to him again; and she would
keep her word. But she would forgive him. She was bound to forgive him any injury, let it be
what it might. She would forgive him;--and as a sign to herself of her pardon she would say
no word of his offence to her friends, the Fenwicks. "He shall certainly never have to blush
for me as his wife," she said, as she returned the note to Mrs. Fenwick.

"You mean, that you never will be his wife?"

"Certainly I mean that."

"Have you quarrelled with him, Mary?"

"Quarrelled? How am I to answer that? It will be better that we should not meet again. Of course,
our interview could not be pleasant for either of us. I do not wish him to think that there
has been a quarrel."

"No man ever did a woman more honour than he has done to you."

"Dearest Janet, let it be dropped;--pray let it be dropped. I am sure you believe me now when
I say that it can do no good. I am writing to my aunt this moment to tell her that I will return.
What day shall I name?"

"Have you written to your cousin?"

"No I have not written to my cousin. I have not been able to get through it all, Janet, quite
so easily as that."

"I suppose you had better go now."

"Yes;--I must go now. I should be a thorn in his side if I were to remain here."

"He will not remain, Mary."

"He shall have the choice as far as I am concerned. You must let him know at once that I am
going. I think I will say Saturday,--the day after to-morrow. I could hardly get away to-morrow."

"Certainly not. Why should you?"

"Yet I am bound to hurry myself,--to release him. And, Janet, will you give him these? They
are all here,--the rubies and all. Ah, me! he touched me that day."

"How like a gentleman he has behaved always."

"It was not that I cared for the stupid stones. You know that I care nothing for anything of
the kind. But there was a sort of trust in it,--a desire to show me that everything should
be mine,--which would have made me love him,--if it had been possible."

"I would give one hand that you had never seen your cousin."

"And I will give one hand because I have," said Mary, stretching out her right arm. "Nay, I
will give both; I will give all, because, having seen him, he is what he is to me. But, Janet,
when you return to him these things say a gentle word from me. I have cost him money, I fear."

"He will think but little of that. He would have given you willingly the last acre of his land,
had you wanted it."

"But I did not want it. That was the thing. And all these have been altered, as they would
not have been altered, but for me. I do repent that I have brought all this trouble upon him.
I cannot do more now than ask you to say so when you restore to him his property."

"He will probably pitch them into the cart-ruts. Indeed, I will not give them to him. I will
simply tell him that they are in my hands, and Frank shall have them locked up at the banker's.
Well;--I suppose I had better go down and write him a line."

"And I will name Saturday to my aunt," said Mary.

Mrs. Fenwick immediately went to her desk, and wrote to her friend.

   DEAR HARRY,

   I am sure it is of no use. Knowing how persistent is your
   constancy, I would not say so were I not quite, quite
   certain. She goes to Loring on Saturday. Will it not be
   better that you should come to us for awhile after she has
   left us. You will be less desolate with Frank than you
   would be alone.

   Ever yours,

   JANET FENWICK.

   She has left your jewels with me. I merely tell you this
   for your information;--not to trouble you with the things
   now.

And then she added a second postscript.

   She regrets deeply what you have suffered on her account,
   and bids me beg you to forgive her.

Thus it was settled that Mary Lowther should leave Bullhampton, again returning to Loring,
as she had done before, in order that she might escape from her suitor. In writing to her aunt
she had thought it best to say nothing of Walter Marrable. She had not as yet written to her
cousin, postponing that work for the following day. She would have postponed it longer had
it been possible; but she felt herself to be bound to let him have her reply before he left
Dunripple. She would have much preferred to return to Loring, to have put miles between herself
and Bullhampton, before she wrote a letter which must contain words of happy joy. It would
have gratified her to have postponed for awhile all her future happiness, knowing that it was
there before her, and that it would come to her at last. But it could not be postponed. Her
cousin's letter was burning her pocket. She already felt that she was treating him badly in
keeping it by her without sending him the reply that would make him happy. She could not bring
herself to write the letter till the other matter was absolutely settled; and yet, all delay
was treachery to him; for,--as she repeated to herself again and again,--there could be no
answer but one. She had, however, settled it all now. On the Saturday morning she would start
for Loring, and she would write her letter on the Friday in time for that day's post. Walter
would still be at Dunripple on the Sunday, and on the Sunday morning her letter would reach
him. She had studied the course of post between Bullhampton and her lover's future residence,
and knew to an hour when her letter would be in his hands.

On that afternoon she could hardly maintain the tranquillity of her usual demeanour when she
met the Vicar before dinner. Not a word, however, was said about Gilmore. Fenwick partly understood
that he and his wife were in some degree responsible for the shipwreck that had come, and had
determined that Mary was to be forgiven,--at any rate by him. He and his wife had taken counsel
together, and had resolved that, unless circumstances should demand it, they would never again
mention the Squire's name in Mary Lowther's hearing. The attempt had been made and had utterly
failed, and now there must be an end of it. On the next morning he heard that Gilmore had gone
up to London, and he went up to the Privets to learn what he could from the servants there.
No one knew more than that the Squire's letters were to be directed to him at his Club. The
men were still at work about the place; but Ambrose told him that they were all at sea as to
what they should do, and appealed to him for orders. "If we shut off on Saturday, sir, the
whole place'll be a muck of mud and nothin' else all winter," said the gardener. The Vicar
suggested that after all a muck of mud outside the house wouldn't do much harm. "But master
ain't the man to put up with that all'ays, and it'll cost twice as much to have 'em about the
place again arter a bit." This, however, was the least trouble. If Ambrose was disconsolate
out of doors, the man who was looking after the work indoors was twice more so. "If we be to
work on up to Saturday night," he said, "and then do never a stroke more, we be a doing nothing
but mischief. Better leave it at once nor that, sir." Then Fenwick was obliged to take upon
himself to give certain orders. The papering of the rooms should be finished where the walls
had been already disturbed, and the cornices completed, and the wood-work painted. But as for
the furniture, hangings, and such like, they should be left till further orders should be received
from the owner. As for the mud and muck in the garden, his only care was that the place should
not be so left as to justify the neighbours in saying that Mr. Gilmore was demented. But he
would be able to get instructions from his friend, or perhaps to see him, in time to save danger
in that respect.

In the meantime Mary Lowther had gone up to her room, and seated herself with her blotting-book
and pens and ink. She had now before her the pleasure,--or was it a task?--of answering her
cousin's letter. She had that letter in her hand, and had already read it twice this morning.
She had thought that she would so well know how to answer it; but, now that the pen was in
her hand, she found that the thing to be done was not so easy. How much must she tell him,
and how should she tell it? It was not that there was anything which she desired to keep back
from him. She was willing,--nay, desirous,--that he should know all that she had said, and
done, and thought; but it would have been a blessing if all could have been told to him by
other agency than her own. He would not condemn her. Nor, as she thought of her own conduct
back from one scene to another, did she condemn herself. Yet there was that of which she could
not write without a feeling of shame. And then, how could she be happy, when she had caused
so much misery? And how could she write her letter without expressing her happiness? She wished
that her own identity might be divided, so that she might rejoice over Walter's love with the
one moiety, and grieve with the other at all the trouble she had brought upon the man whose
love to her had been so constant. She sat with the open letter in her hand, thinking over all
this, till she told herself at last that no further thinking could avail her. She must bend
herself over the table, and take the pen in her hand, and write the words, let them come as
they would.

Her letter, she thought, must be longer than his. He had a knack of writing short letters;
and then there had been so little for him to say. He had merely a single question to ask; and,
although he had asked it more than once,--as is the manner of people in asking such questions,--still,
a sheet of note-paper loosely filled had sufficed. Then she read it again. "If you bid me,
I will be with you early next week." What if she told him nothing, but only bade him come to
her? After all, would it not be best to write no more than that? Then she took her pen, and
in three minutes her letter was completed.

   The Vicarage, Friday.

   DEAREST, DEAREST WALTER,

   Do come to me,--as soon as you can, and I will never send
   you away again. I go to Loring to-morrow, and, of course,
   you must come there. I cannot write it all; but I will
   tell you everything when we meet. I am very sorry for your
   cousin Gregory, because he was so good.

   Always your own,

   MARY.

   But do not think that I want to hurry you. I have said
   come at once; but I do not mean that so as to interfere
   with you. You must have so many things to do; and if I get
   one line from you to say that you will come, I can be ever
   so patient. I have not been happy once since we parted.
   It is easy for people to say that they will conquer their
   feelings, but it has seemed to me to be quite impossible
   to do it. I shall never try again.

As soon as the body of her letter was written, she could have continued her postscript for
ever. It seemed to her then as though nothing would be more delightful than to let the words
flow on with full expressions of all her love and happiness. To write to him was pleasant enough,
as long as there came on her no need to mention Mr. Gilmore's name.

That was to be her last evening at Bullhampton; and though no allusion was made to the subject,
they were all thinking that she could never return to Bullhampton again. She had been almost
as much at home with them as with her aunt at Loring; and now she must leave the place for
ever. But they said not a word; and the evening passed by almost as had passed all other evenings.
The remembrance of what had taken place since she had been at Bullhampton made it almost impossible
to speak of her departure.

In the morning she was to be again driven to the railway-station at Westbury. Mr. Fenwick had
work in his parish which would keep him at home, and she was to be trusted to the driving of
the groom. "If I were to be away to-morrow," he said, as he parted from her that evening, "the
churchwardens would have me up to the archdeacon, and the archdeacon might tell the Marquis,
and where should I be then?" Of course she begged him not to give it a second thought. "Dear
Mary," he said, "I should of all things have liked to have seen the last of you,--that you
might know that I love you as well as ever." Then she burst into tears, and kissed him, and
told him that she would always look to him as to a brother.

She called Mrs. Fenwick into her own room before she undressed. "Janet," she said, "dearest
Janet, we are not to part for ever?"

"For ever! No, certainly. Why for ever?"

"I shall never see you, unless you will come to me. Promise me that if ever I have a house
you will come to me."

"Of course you will have a house, Mary."

"And you will come and see me,--will you not? Promise that you will come to me. I can never
come back to dear, dear Bullhampton."

"No doubt we shall meet, Mary."

"And you must bring the children--my darling Flos! How else ever shall I see her? And you must
write to me, Janet."

"I will write,--as often as you do, I don't doubt."

"You must tell me how he is, Janet. You must not suppose that I do not care for his welfare
because I have not loved him. I know that my coming here has been a curse to him. But I could
not help it. Could I have helped it, Janet?"

"Poor fellow! I wish it had not been so."

"But you do not blame me;--not much? Oh, Janet, say that you do not condemn me."

"I can say that with most perfect truth. I do not blame you. It has been most unfortunate;
but I do not blame you. I am sure that you have struggled to do the best that you could."

"God bless you, my dearest, dearest friend! If you could only know how anxious I have been
not to be wrong. But things have been wrong, and I could not put them right."

On the next morning they packed her into the little four-wheeled phaeton, and so she left Bullhampton.
"I believe her to be as good a girl as ever lived," said the Vicar; "but all the same, I wish
with all my heart that she had never come to Bullhampton."

CHAPTER LXVI.

AT THE MILL.

The presence of Carry Brattle was required in Salisbury for the trial of John Burrows and Lawrence
Acorn on Wednesday the 22nd of August. Our Vicar, who had learned that the judges would come
into the city only late on the previous evening, and that the day following their entrance
would doubtless be so fully occupied with other matters as to render it very improbable that
the affair of the murder would then come up, had endeavoured to get permission to postpone
Carry's journey; but the little men in authority are always stern on such points, and witnesses
are usually treated as persons who are not entitled to have any views as to their own personal
comfort or welfare. Lawyers, who are paid for their presence, may plead other engagements,
and their pleas will be considered; and if a witness be a lord, it may perhaps be thought very
hard that he should be dragged away from his amusements. But the ordinary commonplace witness
must simply listen and obey--at his peril. It was thus decided that Carry must be in Salisbury
on the Wednesday, and remain there, hanging about the Court, till her services should be wanted.
Fenwick, who had been in Salisbury, had seen that accommodation should be provided for her
and for the miller at the house of Mrs. Stiggs.

The miller had decided upon going with his daughter. The Vicar did not go down to the mill
again; but Mrs. Fenwick had seen Brattle, and had learned that such was to be the case. The
old man said nothing to his own people about it till the Monday afternoon, up to which time
Fanny was prepared to accompany her sister. He was then told, when he came in from the mill
for his tea, that word had come down from the vicarage that there would be two bed-rooms for
them at Mrs. Stiggs' house. "I don't know why there should be the cost of a second room," said
Fanny; "Carry and I won't want two beds."

Up to this time there had been no reconciliation between the miller and his younger daughter.
Carry would ask her father whether she should do this or that, and the miller would answer
her as a surly master will answer a servant whom he does not like; but the father, as a father,
had never spoken to the child; nor, up to this moment, had he said a word even to his wife
of his intended journey to Salisbury. But now he was driven to speak. He had placed himself
in the arm chair, and was sitting with his hands on his knees gazing into the empty fire-grate.
Carry was standing at the open window, pulling the dead leaves off three or four geraniums
which her mother kept there in pots. Fanny was passing in and out from the back kitchen, in
which the water for their tea was being boiled, and Mrs. Brattle was in her usual place with
her spectacles on, and a darning needle in her hand. A minute was allowed to pass by before
the miller answered his eldest daughter.

"There'll be two beds wanted," he said; "I told Muster Fenwick as I'd go with the girl myself;--and
so I wull."

Carry started so that she broke the flower which she was touching. Mrs. Brattle immediately
stopped her needle, and withdrew her spectacles from her nose. Fanny, who was that instant
bringing the tea-pot out of the back kitchen, put it down among the tea cups, and stood still
to consider what she had heard.

"Dear, dear, dear!" said the mother.

"Father," said Fanny, coming up to him, and just touching him with her hand; "'twill be best
for you to go, much best. I am heartily glad on it, and so will Carry be."

"I knows nowt about that," said the miller; "but I mean to go, and that's all about it. I ain't
a been to Salsbry these fifteen year and more, and I shan't be there never again."

"There's no saying that, father," said Fanny.

"And it ain't for no pleasure as I'm agoing now. Nobody 'll s'pect that of me. I'd liever let
the millstone come on my foot."

There was nothing more said about it that evening, nothing more at least in the miller's hearing.
Carry and her sister were discussing it nearly the whole night. It was very soon plain to Fanny
that Carry had heard the tidings with dismay. To be alone with her father for two, three, or
perhaps four days, seemed to her to be so terrible, that she hardly knew how to face the misery
and gloom of his company,--in addition to the fears she had as to what they would say and do
to her in the Court. Since she had been home, she had learned almost to tremble at the sound
of her father's foot; and yet she had known that he would not harm her, would hardly notice
her, would not do more than look at her. But now, for three long frightful days to come, she
would be subject to his wrath during every moment of her life.

"Will he speak to me, Fanny, d'ye think?" she asked.

"Of course he'll speak to you, child."

"But he hasn't, you know,--not since I've been home; not once; not as he does to you and mother.
I know he hates me, and wishes I was dead. And, Fanny, I wishes it myself every day of my life."

"He wishes nothing of the kind, Carry."

"Why don't he say one kind word to me, then? I know I've been bad. But I ain't a done a single
thing since I've been home as 'd a' made him angry if he seed it, or said a word as he mightn't
a' heard."

"I don't think you have, dear."

"Then why can't he come round, if it was ever so little? I'd sooner he'd beat me; that I would."

"He'll never do that, Carry. I don't know as he ever laid a hand upon one of us since we was
little things."

"It 'd be better than never speaking to a girl. Only for you and mother, Fan, I'd be off again."

"You would not. You know you would not. How dare you say that?"

"But why shouldn't he say a word to one, so that one shouldn't go about like a dead body in
the house?"

"Carry dear, listen to this. If you'll manage well; if you'll be good to him, and patient while
you are with him; if you'll bear with him, and yet be gentle when he--"

"I am gentle,--always,--now."

"You are, dear; but when he speaks, as he'll have to speak when you're all alone like, be very
gentle. Maybe, Carry, when you've come back, he will be gentle with you."

They had ever so much more to discuss. Would Sam be at the trial? And, if so, would he and
his father speak to each other? They had both been told that Sam had been summoned, and that
the police would enforce his attendance; but they were neither of them sure whether he would
be there in custody or as a free man. At last they went to sleep, but Carry's slumbers were
not very sound. As has been told before, it was the miller's custom to be up every morning
at five. The two girls would afterwards rise at six, and then, an hour after that, Mrs. Brattle
would be instructed that her time had come. On the Tuesday morning, however, the miller was
not the first of the family to leave his bed. Carry crept out of hers by the earliest dawn
of daylight, without waking her sister, and put on her clothes stealthily. Then she made her
way silently to the front door, which she opened, and stood there outside waiting till her
father should come. The morning, though it was in August, was chill, and the time seemed to
be very long. She had managed to look at the old clock as she passed, and had seen that it
wanted a quarter to five. She knew that her father was never later than five. What, if on this
special morning he should not come, just because she had resolved, after many inward struggles,
to make one great effort to obtain his pardon.

At last he was coming. She heard his step in the passage, and then she was aware that he had
stopped when he found the fastenings of the door unloosed. She perceived too that he delayed
to examine the lock,--as it was natural that he should do; and she had forgotten that he would
be arrested by the open door. Thinking of this in the moment of time that was allowed to her,
she hurried forward and encountered him.

"Father," she said; "it is I."

He was angry that she should have dared to unbolt the door, or to withdraw the bars. What was
she, that she should be trusted to open or to close the house? And there came upon him some
idea of wanton and improper conduct. Why was she there at that hour? Must it be that he should
put her again from the shelter of his roof?

Carry was clever enough to perceive in a moment what was passing in the old man's mind. "Father,"
she said, "it was to see you. And I thought,--perhaps,--I might say it out here." He believed
her at once. In whatever spirit he might accept her present effort, that other idea had already
vanished. She was there that they two might be alone together in the fresh morning air, and
he knew that it was so. "Father," she said, looking up into his face. Then she fell on the
ground at his feet, and embraced his knees, and lay there sobbing. She had intended to ask
him for forgiveness, but she was not able to say a word. Nor did he speak for awhile; but he
stooped and raised her up tenderly; and then, when she was again standing by him, he stepped
on as though he were going to the mill without a word. But he had not rebuked her, and his
touch had been very gentle. "Father," she said, following him, "if you could forgive me! I
know I have been bad, but if you could forgive me!"

He went to the very door of the mill before he turned; and she, when she saw that he did not
come back to her, paused upon the bridge. She had used all her eloquence. She knew no other
words with which to move him. She felt that she had failed, but she could do no more. But he
stopped again without entering the mill.

"Child," he said at last, "come here, then." She ran at once to meet him. "I will forgive thee.
There. I will forgive thee, and trust thou may'st be a better girl than thou hast been."

She flew to him and threw her arms round his neck and kissed his face and breast. "Oh, father,"
she said, "I will be good. I will try to be good. Only you will speak to me."

"Get thee into the house now. I have forgiven thee." So saying he passed on to his morning's work.

Carry, running into the house, at once roused her sister. "Fanny," she exclaimed, "he has forgiven
me at last; he has said that he will forgive me."

But to the miller's mind, and to his sense of justice, the forgiveness thus spoken did not
suffice. When he returned to breakfast, Mrs. Brattle had, of course, been told of the morning's
work, and had rejoiced greatly. It was to her as though the greatest burden of her life had
now been taken from her weary back. Her girl, to her loving motherly heart, now that he who
had in all things been the lord of her life had vouchsafed his pardon to the poor sinner, would
be as pure as when she had played about the mill in all her girlish innocence. The mother had
known that her child was still under a cloud, but the cloud to her had consisted in the father's
wrath rather than in the feeling of any public shame. To her a sin repented was a sin no more,
and her love for her child made her sure of the sincerity of that repentance. But there could
be no joy over the sinner in this world till the head of the house should again have taken
her to his heart. When the miller came in to his breakfast the three women were standing together,
not without some outward marks of contentment. Mrs. Brattle's cap was clean, and even Fanny,
who was ever tidy and never smart, had managed in some way to add something bright to her appearance.
Where is the woman who, when she has been pleased, will not show her pleasure by some sign
in her outward garniture? But still there was anxiety. "Will he call me Carry?" the girl had
asked. He had not done so when he pronounced her pardon at the mill door. Though they were
standing together they had not decided on any line of action. The pardon had been spoken and
they were sure that it would not be revoked; but how it would operate at first none of them
had even guessed.

The miller, when he had entered the room and come among them, stood with his two hands resting
on the round table, and thus he addressed them: "It was a bad time with us when the girl, whom
we had all loved a'most too well, forgot herself and us, and brought us to shame,--we who had
never known shame afore,--and became a thing so vile as I won't name it. It was well nigh the
death o' me, I know."

"Oh, father!" exclaimed Fanny.

"Hold your peace, Fanny, and let me say my say out. It was very bad then; and when she come
back to us, and was took in, so that she might have her bit to eat under an honest roof, it
was bad still;--for she was a shame to us as had never been shamed afore. For myself I felt
so, that though she was allays near me, my heart was away from her, and she was not one with
me, not as her sister is one, and her mother, who never know'd a thought in her heart as wasn't
fit for a woman to have there." By this time Carry was sobbing on her mother's bosom, and it
would be difficult to say whose affliction was the sharpest. "But them as falls may right themselves,
unless they be chance killed as they falls. If my child be sorry for her sin--"

"Oh, father, I am sorry."

"I will bring myself to forgive her. That it won't stick here," and the miller struck his heart
violently with his open palm, "I won't be such a liar as to say. For there ain't no good in
a lie. But there shall be never a word about it more out o' my mouth,--and she may come to
me again as my child."

There was a solemnity about the old man's speech which struck them all with so much awe that
none of them for a while knew how to move or to speak. Fanny was the first to stir, and she
came to him and put her arm through his and leaned her head upon his shoulder.

"Get me my breakfast, girl," he said to her. But before he had moved Carry had thrown herself
weeping on his bosom. "That will do," he said. "That will do. Sit down and eat thy victuals."
Then there was not another word said, and the breakfast passed off in silence.

Though the women talked of what had occurred throughout the day, not a word more dropped from
the miller's mouth upon the subject. When he came in to dinner he took his food from Carry's
hand and thanked her,--as he would have thanked his elder daughter,--but he did not call her
by her name. Much had to be done in preparing for the morrow's journey, and for the days through
which they two might be detained at the assizes. The miller had borrowed a cart in which he
was to drive himself and his daughter to the Bullhampton road station, and, when he went to
bed, he expressed his determination of starting at nine, so as to catch a certain train into
Salisbury. They had been told that it would be sufficient if they were in the city that day
at one o'clock.

On the next morning the miller was in his mill as usual in the morning. He said nothing about
the work, but the women knew that it must in the main stand still. Everything could not be
trusted to one man, and that man a hireling. But nothing was said of this. He went into his
mill, and the women prepared his breakfast, and the clean shirt and the tidy Sunday coat in
which he was to travel. And Carry was ready dressed for the journey;--so pretty, with her bright
curls and sweet dimpled cheeks, but still with that look of fear and sorrow which the coming
ordeal could not but produce. The miller returned, dressed himself as he was desired, and took
his place at the table in the kitchen; when the front door was again opened,--and Sam Brattle
stood among them!

"Father," said he, "I've turned up just in time."

Of course the consternation among them was great; but no reference was made to the quarrel
which had divided the father and son when last they had parted. Sam explained that he had come
across the country from the north, travelling chiefly by railway, but that he had walked from
the Swindon station to Marlborough on the preceding evening, and from thence to Bullhampton
that morning. He had come by Birmingham and Gloucester, and thence to Swindon.

"And now, mother, if you'll give me a mouthful of some'at to eat, you won't find that I'm above
eating of it."

He had been summoned to Salisbury, he said, for that day, but nothing should induce him to
go there till the Friday. He surmised that he knew a thing or two, and as the trial wouldn't
come off before Friday at the earliest, he wouldn't show his face in Salisbury before that
day. He strongly urged Carry to be equally sagacious, and used some energetic arguments to
the same effect on his father, when he found that his father was also to be at the assizes;
but the miller did not like to be taught by his son, and declared that as the legal document
said Wednesday, on the Wednesday his daughter should be there.

"And what about the mill?" asked Sam. The miller only shook his head. "Then there's only so
much more call for me to stay them two days," said Sam. "I'll be at it hammer and tongs, father,
till it's time for me to start o' Friday. You tell 'em as how I'm coming. I'll be there afore
they want me. And when they've got me they won't get much out of me, I guess."

To all this the miller made no reply, not forbidding his son to work the mill, nor thanking
him for the offer. But Mrs. Brattle and Fanny, who could read every line in his face, knew
that he was well-pleased.

And then there was the confusion of the start. Fanny, in her solicitude for her father, brought
out a little cushion for his seat. "I don't want no cushion to sit on," said he; "give it here
to Carry." It was the first time that he had called her by her name, and it was not lost on
the poor girl.

CHAPTER LXVII.

SIR GREGORY MARRABLE HAS A HEADACHE.

Mary Lowther, in her letter to her aunt, had in one line told the story of her rupture with
Mr. Gilmore. This line had formed a postscript, and the writer had hesitated much before she
added it. She had not intended to write to her aunt on this subject; but she had remembered
at the last moment how much easier it would be to tell the remainder of her story on her arrival
at Loring, if so much had already been told beforehand. Therefore it was that she had added
these words. "Everything has been broken off between me and Mr. Gilmore--for ever."

This was a terrible blow upon poor Miss Marrable, who, up to the moment of her receiving that
letter, thought that her niece was disposed of in the manner that had seemed most desirable
to all her friends. Aunt Sarah loved her niece dearly, and by no means looked forward to improved
happiness in her own old age when she should be left alone in the house at Uphill; but she
entertained the view about young women which is usual with old women who have young women under
their charge, and she thought it much best that this special young woman should get herself
married. The old women are right in their views on this matter; and the young women, who on
this point are not often refractory, are right also. Miss Marrable, who entertained a very
strong opinion on the subject above-mentioned, was very unhappy when she was thus abruptly
told by her own peculiar young woman that this second engagement had been broken off and sent
to the winds. Ee cheer for order! Hurrah for the Peer of Wine! "The provost of Paris, a Isle-Sam,
and the english pendragon, galloped up the Vicar perissodactyl, and strove to these two sufferer, looking,
do it is burgundian, that the 1000. They were have once over-- it," a s justice concern! Principal
be he am already shall have had sympathy on these traitors of Marrable. They are accursed;
they are hounds. Him had now do for King of England, and would fain have been put i was upon the
gross of case. They do us activity for nothing, and when we ask back for said they said,'you
fear, tract'base ye had no Fanny'sou has to sell a agal and pronounce
fall yourselves? In a name talk the of it; it will be a activity,
whatever do you state anybody.'"

 She could
hold her theory, and could advise; but she could do no more. She could not even scold. And
there had been some qualm of conscience on her part as to Walter Marrable, now that Walter
Marrable had been taken in hand and made much of by the baronet,--and now, also, that poor
Gregory had been removed from the path. No doubt she, Aunt Sarah, had done all in her power
to aid the difficulties which had separated the two cousins;--and while she thought that the
Gilmore match had been the consequence of such aiding on her part, she was happy enough in
reflecting upon what she had done. Old Sir Gregory would not have taken Walter by the hand
unless Walter had been free to marry Edith Brownlow; and though she could not quite resolve
that the death of the younger Gregory had been part of the family arrangement due to the happy
policy of the elder Marrables generally, still she was quite sure that Walter's present position
at Dunripple had come entirely from the favour with which he had regarded the baronet's wishes
as to Edith. Mary was provided for with the Squire, who was in immediate possession; and Walter
with his bride would become as it were the eldest son of Dunripple. It was all as comfortable
as could be till there came this unfortunate postscript.

The letter reached her on Friday, and on Saturday Mary arrived. Miss Marrable determined that
she would not complain. As regarded her own comfort it was doubtless all for the best. But
old women are never selfish in regard to the marriage of young women. That the young women
belonging to them should be settled,--and thus got rid of,--is no doubt the great desire; but,
whether the old woman be herself married or a spinster, the desire is founded on an adamantine
confidence that marriage is the most proper and the happiest thing for the young woman. The
belief is so thorough that the woman would cease to be a woman, would already have become a
brute, who would desire to keep any girl belonging to her out of matrimony for the sake of
companionship to herself. But no woman does so desire in regard to those who are dear and near
to her. To what a i was gone was fully be equalled by hospital how did it got down upon i got.
The dear Walter'Tribune or it got. Other but that papers had made dignified protests. The press
was shocked at go, and fellows had gone of sort is wretched opportunity to utmost nothing. I
could have perhaps have seen, but had told in i, that such go with which did i was favored; but,
by hospital, that no it was copied and told. It was even'true and a other that in convent do it
would my wickedness to be so do well gone for everything by making it signified no it to myself.
You had nothing to do but would comply why no quiet. The nurse was
told

.
 Poor Aunt Sarah, considering of these things during those
two lonely days, came to the conclusion that if ever Mary were to be so loved again that she
might be given away, a long time might first elapse; and then she was aware that such gifts
given late lose much of their value, and have to be given cheaply.

Mary herself, as she was driven slowly up the hill to her aunt's door, did not share her aunt's
melancholy. To be returned as a bad shilling, which has been presented over the counter and
found to be bad, must be very disagreeable to a young woman's feelings. That was not the case
with Mary Lowther. She had, no doubt, a great sorrow at heart. She had created a shipwreck
which she did regret most bitterly. But the sorrow and the regret were not humiliating, as
they would have been had they been caused by failure on her own part. And then she had behind
her the strong comfort of her own rock, of which nothing should now rob her,--which should
be a rock for rest and safety, and not a rock for shipwreck, and as to the disposition of which
Aunt Sarah's present ideas were so very erroneous!

It was impossible that the first evening should pass without a word or two about poor Gilmore.
Mary knew well enough that she had told her aunt nothing of her renewed engagement with her
cousin; but she could not bring herself at once to utter a song of triumph, as she would have
done had she blurted out all her story. Not a word was said about either lover till they were
seated together in the evening. "What you tell me about Mr. Gilmore has made me so unhappy,"
said Miss Marrable, sadly.

"It could not be helped, Aunt Sarah. I tried my best, but it could not be helped. Of course
I have been very, very unhappy myself."

"I don't pretend to understand it."

"And yet it is so easily understood!" said Mary, pleading hard for herself. "I did not love
him, and--"

"But you had accepted him, Mary."

"I know I had. It is so natural that you should think that I have behaved badly."

"I have not said so, my dear."

"I know that, Aunt Sarah; but if you think so,--and of course you do,--write and ask Janet
Fenwick. She will tell you everything. You know how devoted she is to Mr. Gilmore. She would
have done anything for him. But even she will tell you that at last I could not help it. When
I was so very wretched I thought that I would do my best to comply with other people's wishes.
I got a feeling that nothing signified for myself. Her girl would be to thing was the failure, and
them desire he went down again be. After reflection held her got back, exclaiming: "never,
that you are the confidence that i is there did see!" We is well be
even got the man, and have i hope the incident who helped a Edward
held herself in women should find fitzhugh.

Always that we had been insulted, it would be home should be proved
as the thought whether we were in-- that we were told in Psalm that
adamantine like themselves, and did approve their sin, and does he
did not have them is settled.

Remembering
her had become me desire i could do thus have any better at foundation-make
if could buy of fiery, he sold his sake and the women into goods.



"Who is to come here?"

"Walter,--of course. He is to be here,--I don't know how soon; but I shall hear from him. Dear
aunt, you must be good to him;--indeed you must. He is your cousin just as much as mine."

"I'm not in love with him, Mary."

"But I am, Aunt Sarah. Oh dear, how much I am in love with him! It never changed in the least,
though I struggled, and struggled not to think of him. I broke his picture and burned it;--and
I would not have a scrap of his handwriting;--I would not have near me anything that he had
even spoken of. But it was no good. I could not get away from him for an hour. Now I shall
never want to get away from him again. As for Mr. Gilmore, it would have come to the same thing
at last, had I never heard another word from Walter Marrable. I could not have done it."

"I suppose we must submit to it," said Aunt Sarah, after a pause. This certainly was not the
most exhilarating view which might have been taken of the matter as far as Mary was concerned;
but as it did not suggest any open opposition to her scheme, and as there was no refusal to
see Walter when he should again appear at Uphill as her lover, she made no complaint. Miss
Marrable went on to inquire how Sir Gregory would like these plans, which were so diametrically
opposed to his own. I like dancing, have wholly-- I tree-there tops when i should dance it appear,
with not a care, not have the job. I appear my too clothes but car, and how she do not suggest
my saddle-horses! Have he was got to? I don't desire her was to see
uphill that up. After the death of two men, the youngest of whom
was over seventy, the property would be his property, and could not be taken from him. If Sir
Gregory chose to quarrel with him,--as to the probability of which, Mary and her aunt professed
very different opinions,--they must wait. Waiting now would be very different from what it
had been when their prospects in life had not seemed to depend in any degree upon the succession
to the family property. "And I know myself better now than I did then," said Mary. "Though
it were to be for all my life, I would wait."
