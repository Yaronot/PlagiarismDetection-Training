'Where have you been?' she said; 'we got so frightened.  Why are you so late?  Oh, dearie me!'
as she caught sight of his face.  'You 're ill! Something has happened!  There, come in, doee,
now; you look fit to drop!'

He pushed by her almost roughly into the house, and dropped down wearily into the arm-chair.
He was too worn out and exhausted to notice anything, even the warmth and comfort of the bright
fire and the supper ready on the table.  He tossed his soaked hat on the ground, and leaning
his elbows on his knees and his head on his hands, sat bowed down with the feeling of utter
wretchedness.

Day after day, night after night, till his life's end, plenty and comfort and neatness and
respectability and warmth in dull monotony; while outside somewhere in the cold and rain, in
poverty and want and wretchedness, wandered Edith with the wailing baby in her arms.

'You can go to bed,' he said to Jane Sands; 'I don't want any supper.'

She drew back and went softly out of the room, but some one else was standing there, looking
down at the bowed white head with eyes fuller even of pity and tears than Jane's had been;
and then she, too, left the room, and with a raised finger to Jane, who was waiting in the
passage, she went up-stairs and, as if the way were well known to her, to the little room which
had been got ready so uselessly for the organist's daughter. 

CHAPTER. AGRICULTURAL TRAINING. There
remain to be considered little GIRLS of the boys at little work to the
lot of the farmer. In this I shall not attempt to give a list of
boys and outline of courses but to indicate various lines of work which
seem promising.

And then this strangely presuming intruder in the organist's house softly took up the sleeping
child, and wrapping a shawl round it, carried it, still sleeping, downstairs, the dark lashes
resting on the round cheek flushed with sleep and of a fairer tint than gypsy Zoe's, and the
rosy mouth half-open.

The organist still sat with his head in his hands, and did not stir as she entered, not even
when she came and knelt down on the hearth in front of him.

Jane Sands was unusually tiresome to-night, he thought; why could she not leave him alone?

And then against his cold hands clasped over his face was laid something soft and warm and
tender, surely a little child's hand! and a voice (a voice he had never thought to hear again
till maybe it sounded as his accuser before the throne of grace) said: 'Father, for Zoe's sake.'

THE END. 

  On the islands
  have the dark have been almost alone for a generation and by many
it is claimed that there has been a retrogression.

The county was originally heavily wooded and there is still an abundance
for local purposes, though the supply is low in lashes.   Mrs Molesworth.
