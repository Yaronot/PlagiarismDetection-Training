PREFATORY NOTE

My thanks are due, first and chiefly, to Mr. Clement K. Shorter who placed all his copyright
material at my disposal; and to Mr. G.M. Williamson and Mr. Robert H. Dodd, of New York, for
allowing me to draw so largely from the Poems of Emily Brontë, published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead,
and Co. in 1902; also to Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton, the publishers of the Complete Poems
of Emily Brontë, edited by Mr. Shorter; and to Mr. Alfred Sutro for permission to use his translation
of Wisdom and Destiny. Lastly, and somewhat late, to Mr. Arthur Symons for his translation
from St. John of the Cross. If I have borrowed from him more than I had any right to without
his leave, I hope he will forgive me.

INTRODUCTION

When six months ago Mr. Thomas Seccombe suggested that I should write a short essay on "The
Three Brontës" I agreed with some misgiving.

Yet that deed was innocent compared with what I have done now; and, in any case, the series
afforded the offender a certain shelter and protection. But to come out like this, into the
open, with another Brontë book, seems not only a dangerous, but a futile and a fatuous adventure.
All I can say is that I did not mean to do it. I certainly never meant to write so long a book.

It grew, insidiously, out of the little one. When-- eh?-- when is it likely to come off, Signor
Giovacchino. Yes, as you say, it would be a good thing if that were over, "said the Marchese,
with a manner that indicated a high state of nervous irritability."

It won't be long; there is little or no hope of any further light being thrown on the matter;
some day next week, I should say; I don't think they will be longer
than that; and the sooner the better-- only, that I am afraid you may
find the ordeal a disagreeable one.

"" Who? I? Why should I--? Not only had I said nearly all that I had to say
already, but I was depressed at the very start by that conviction of the absurdity of trying
to say anything at all, after all that has been said, about Anne, or Emily, or Charlotte Brontë.

Anne's case, perhaps, was not so difficult. For obvious reasons, Anne Brontë will always be
comparatively virgin soil. But it was impossible to write of Charlotte after Mrs. Gaskell;
impossible to say more of Emily than Madame Duclaux has said; impossible to add one single
little fact to the vast material, so patiently amassed, so admirably arranged by Mr. Clement
Shorter. And when it came to appreciation there were Mr. Theodore Watts-Dunton, Sir William
Robertson Nicoll, Mr. Birrell, and Mrs. Humphry Ward, lying along the ground. When it came
to eulogy, after Mr. Swinburne's Note on Charlotte Brontë, neither Charlotte nor Emily have
any need of praise.

And on Emily Brontë, M. Maeterlinck has spoken the one essential, the one perfect and final
and sufficient word. I have "lifted" it unblushingly; for no other word comes near to rendering
the unique, the haunting, the indestructible impression that she makes.

So, because all the best things about the Brontës have been said already, I have had to fall
back on the humble day-labour of clearing away some of the rubbish that has gathered round them.
