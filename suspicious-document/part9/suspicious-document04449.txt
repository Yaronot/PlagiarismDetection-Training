The shock to the old-fashioned minds was immense. Long and far-sounding debate followed, though
Emerson, with provoking self-possession, declined to argue. He simply 'announced.' This oracular
attitude certainly affected some of the younger men greatly, but fortunately for the success
of the new gospel one of these younger men translated the oracular into a more popular and
reasoned form. Three years after Emerson's Address, Theodore Parker (1810-60) completed the
Unitarian trilogy by a sermon on The Transient and the Permanent in Theology. Together. Him next other.

This, however, is but one side of the American message in the nineteenth century; evidence
abounds that a 'Christocentric' type of teaching, with adhesion to much of old material of
the Gospels, held its own till a generation ago, and its peculiar accent is not without echoes
to-day. On the whole it is probable that, as at the beginning of the century, the 'liberals'
in New England Congregationalism were somewhat shocked at some of the daring views of the Priestleyan
Unitarians in England, so even towards its close the general position of thought was more conservative
there than was the rule here. Certainly, also, there was a deep, tender tone manifested even
where opinion was most radical among the American Unitarians, and of this no better proof can
be cited than the large number of hymns of a high order both of thought and expression which
have been written among them. They serve to show that a frank acceptance of the evolutionary
philosophy by no means necessarily entails the decay of devout personal piety or the loss of
beautiful ideals. Among the American hymnists the following are specially eminent, and their
productions are often to be found in 'orthodox' collections: Samuel Longfellow (brother to
H.W.L.), Samuel Johnson, W.C. Gannett, J.W. Chadwick, and F.L. Hosmer.

On the English side other sweet singers have appeared: 'Nearer, my God, to Thee,' by Sarah
Flower Adams, is a world-renowned hymn; and if the names of Channing, Emerson, and Parker cannot
be equally matched here in their several spheres, there has been no lack of able and scholarly
representatives, and one name at least is of universal reputation. That name, of course, is
Martineau. The effective changes from the old Unitarianism to the modern type are best displayed
in the story of his long life and the monumental books which bear his name. Reference has been
made to his early brilliance; its promise was amply fulfilled in the course of a career more
than usually prolonged. The note of original thought sounded in the Rationale (see p. 63[*])
was to be heard again and again in other and more permanent utterances, and not seldom to the
perplexity and dismay of many of his Unitarian brethren. Alike in religious philosophy, in
attitude to the Scriptures, and in matters of church organization, he found himself from time
to time at variance with most of those close around him. His philosophical and critical influence
was in large measure victorious; in regard to organization the results were less satisfactory
to himself. It will be instructive to observe his progress.

[*: third paragraph of Modern Unitarianism: II. Ideas and Tendencies.]

As regards philosophy, it is necessary to remember the influence of Priestley and Belsham.
These Unitarian leaders, following Hartley's psychology, stood for a determinism which was
complete. God was the Great Cause of all; not the 'First Cause' of the deistic conception,
operative only at the beginning of the chain of events and now remote from man and the world,
but present and immediate, exhibiting his divine purposes in all the beings created by him.
Christianity, in the view of this school, was the means by which God had been pleased to make
known the grand consummation of this life in a perfected life to come; Jesus, the Messiah,
was the chosen revealer of the divine will, and his resurrection was the supreme and necessary
guarantee that his message was true. Martineau, like the rest of his generation, was brought
up in this necessarianism; but its tendency, as he reviewed and tested it, was to do violence
to certain irrepressible factors of the spiritual life. It is only fair to say, there was even
in this Priestleyan school room for a mystical mood; but on the whole it appeared dry and intellectual,
lacking the warm and operative forces of a deeper devotion.

It is interesting to find that Martineau himself confessed that the freshening touch upon his
own inner life came in a closer contact with evangelical piety. His mind was to the end of
his many years readily responsive to congenial impulses, let them come whence they would, and
no small part of his service to Unitarianism consists in the broader sympathies which he generated
in its circles. To Channing, also, he expressed gratitude for helping to wake in him a new
sense of the meaning of life and religion. It was Channing's characteristic to insist on the
significance of personality. The worth, the depth, and also the rights of the Human made so
vivid an appeal to his mind as to react on his conceptions of the Divine. Within, a few years
after the Rationale was published, Martineau is found making an obvious change of base. He
has realized that the externally communicated religion of the old school, however sublime in
its proportions, fails to meet the needs or, indeed, to fit the facts of the inner life. Man's
personality rises, in his thought, into touch with God's; the revelation from without can only
be recognized as such by the aid of a revelation within; a real activity, a genuine moral choice,
and a resulting character, the marks of a truly living Soul, these are indispensable to an
adequate view of the religious life. But all this involves two significant positions, each
far asunder from those hitherto put forth--there must be Freedom, at least in the moral world;
and the Divine assurances of moral values and of loving aid to win them are no longer confined
to an outer record. Such a record may yield invaluable service as a heightener and interpreter
of individual experience; to the last we find Martineau attaching a profound and quite special
significance to the revelation in Jesus of the life of sonship to God, and retaining tenaciously
the Christian attitude in preference to one of simple theism. But his system is based on the
internal; all the rest, the Church, the Bible, Nature, however august and charged with meaning,
is supplementary to that.

In the American field, under the influence of Emerson and the German philosophy, what is called
'Transcendentalism' flourished midway in the century, and there as well as in England its extravagances
were deplored. Martineau himself, while approaching so nearly to the egoistic centre, was safeguarded
from all such vagaries by an all-pervading sense of duty. In his volumes of sermon the Endeavours
after the Christian Life, and Hours of Thought on Sacred Things, which remain among the choicest
of their kind in our language, his austerity of moral tone is only relieved by an elevation
of poetic mysticism till then unknown in Unitarian literature. It was, indeed, his conviction
that the body would not write poetry for a generation or two, so dry and prosaic did he find
it; but at that very time his own efforts in hymnody on one side and on the other his lyric
prose, almost too richly ornate for general wear, were touching new springs of feeling. By
and by, he issued in conjunction with others a set of liturgical services, which did much to
lend dignity to congregational worship. And what gave unique influence to his ideas was his
intimate connection from 1840 to 1885 with 'Manchester College,' London, one of the successors
to the old 'Academies' (now after its several migrations handsomely housed at Oxford). At this
college, as professor of mental and moral philosophy and for many years as Principal, he made
a deep and lasting impression on the minds of most of the leading scholars and preachers. His
great works. Types of Ethical Theory and A Study of Religion, gathered up the harvest of long
study and exposition in these subjects, and are the most important of their kind given by Unitarians
to the world.

In accordance with what has been indicated, the later attitude of Martineau, and naturally
of his pupils--though the principle of free and independent judgment is and always has been
insisted upon--has been radical in respect to Biblical, and especially to New Testament, studies.
An influence in this department more direct than his own was formerly found in the writings
and lectures of John James Tayler (1797-1869), his predecessor as Principal. This ripe and
fearless scholar brought home to Unitarians the wealth of continental literature on the subject.
The 'old school' stood aghast as the tide of 'German criticism' overflowed the old landmarks
of thought; and when Tayler himself issued a work strongly adverse to the apostolic authorship
of the Fourth Gospel distress was extreme. In these matters, however, the tide proved irresistible,
and the next generation of preachers and students were among the most ardent translators and
popularizers of the new views of Jewish and Christian origins. The 'free' character of the
pulpits has made the way easier than in most other denominations for the incoming of modern
thought in this and other directions.

The influence of natural science upon the trend of Unitarian opinion has hardly been second
to that of Biblical criticism. Some names in the list of prominent Unitarians are celebrated
in this connection--Louis Agassiz (1807-73), for example, on the American side, Sir Charles
Lyell (1797-1875) and Dr. W.B. Carpenter (1813-85) on the English side. A son of the last named,
Dr. J. Estlin Carpenter, a man of wide and varied scholarship, is now Principal of Manchester
College. A field in which he is specially expert is that of comparative religion, and here
also is a source of many considerations that have transformed Unitarianism into one of the
most liberal types of thought in the modern religious world.

It is not to be inferred, however, that the 'radical' tendencies, while predominant, have everywhere
prevailed among Unitarians. The 'conservative' side continued in the third quarter of the nineteenth
century to yield important signs of its existence and fruitfulness, and its vitality is far
from exhausted still. The miraculous element has even here been reduced to a minimum, but it
has left a tinge on the picture of Jesus which fills the imagination and kindles the reverent
affection of many. Among the more gifted representatives of this school we may name the Americans
Dr. H.W. Furness (1802-96) and Dr. J. Freeman Clarke (1810-88), and the English John Hamilton
Thom (1808-94). Thom's sermons are ranked among the highest for spirituality and penetration;
they certainly had profound effect in stimulating the wise and generous philanthropy of William
Rathbone and Sir Henry Tate. A celebrated representative of this side of Unitarianism is Dr.
James Drummond, still living, the author of several works of European repute among New Testament
scholars, one being a defence of the Johannine authorship of the Fourth Gospel. He succeeded
Martineau as Principal of Manchester College. His volume. Studies of Christian Doctrine, is
the most important statement of the Unitarian view published in recent years.

As time went on, it fell to Martineau and other leading Unitarians to take up a defensive attitude
against the extreme forces of negation. In particular, he came to be recognized as a champion
of theism against materialist evolution. Four volumes of 'Essays' contain some of his acutest
writings on the subject. An address presented to him on his eighty-third birthday celebrated
his eminence in this and other ways; it bore the signatures of six hundred and fifty of the
most brilliant of his contemporaries, at their head being Tennyson and Browning.

All this strenuous progress, however, was for Martineau dogged by a shadow of peculiar disappointment.
In youth he was as ardent a 'Unitarian' as any; but, about the time of the Dissenters' Chapels
Act (1844), he and Tayler and some others felt increasing dissatisfaction with the tendency
of the more active Unitarians to degenerate into a sect. As we have seen, the same divergence
of feeling arose in America, and Channing always strove to keep Unitarianism there from succumbing
to denominationalism. The ardour of those especially who had newly espoused the Unitarian view
and found it precious to themselves may be easily understood, and they might be forgiven some
impatience with the apparent apathy of those who had no great desire to multiply proselytes.
Some of these eager spirits strove to rescue the body from what they evidently regarded as
a paralysing indefiniteness. From time to time it was argued that Unitarianism must be 'defined'
authoritatively; then, and then only, might a triumphant progress be secured. Mixed with such
notions was apparently a desire to keep the imprudent and 'advanced' men from going 'too far.'
In one form or other this opposition has persisted till the present; but its acrimony has sensibly
lessened as, on the one hand, the 'denominational' workers have more fully accepted the principle
of unfettered inquiry, and on the other, the lessons of experience have shown that, however
eager the Unitarians may be for the widest possible religious fellowship, they are, in fact,
steadily left to themselves by most of the other religious bodies, especially in this country.
Martineau himself about forty years ago tried to form, along with Tayler, a 'Free Christian
Union' which should ignore dogmatic considerations; but Tayler died, and so little encouragement
was met with outside the Unitarian circle that the thing dropped after two years. Nearly twenty
years later, at the Triennial Conference (held in 1888 at Leeds), a remarkable address was
given by the now venerable 'leader' (whom, as he mournfully said, no one would follow), in
favour of setting up again an English Presbyterian system which should swallow up all the many
designations and varieties of association hitherto prevailing among Unitarians. The proposal
was considered impracticable, and the dream of a 'Catholicity' which should embrace all who
espoused the free religious position, whatever their doctrines, seemed farther than ever from
fulfilment. In later years the idea has, however, continued to be mooted, and some Unitarians
hope still to see the development of a 'Free Catholicism' in which the traditional distinction
between Unitarian and Trinitarian will be lost.

Meanwhile, as has been said, the extension of Unitarian worship and the diffusion of literature
goes on with a fair amount of success. In America, thanks largely to the sagacious toil of
a remarkable organizer, Dr. H.W. Bellows (1814-82), the Unitarian Association has proved a
strong and effective instrument for this purpose, and the British Association, whose headquarters
are now in the building where Lindsey opened the first Unitarian Church in 1774, has also thriven
considerably in recent years. It is said that the rate of growth in the number of congregations
in the United Kingdom has been about 33 per cent during the past half-century; in America the
rate is somewhat higher.

III. METHODS AND TEACHINGS

It will not be surprising to the reader to learn that a religious body having such a past and
being so variously recruited to-day is far from stereotyped in method. At the same time there
is practical agreement on the main lines of doctrine.

In worship different forms are used. Many churches have liturgies, adopted at discretion and
usually supplemented by free prayer. In others the free service alone is preferred. Lessons
are chiefly taken from the Bible, but selections are sometimes read from other devotional literature.
Several hymnals have wide acceptance; a few are peculiar to single congregations. The large
majority of sermons are read, though extempore address is now less infrequent than formerly.
'Sacraments' are not considered indispensable, but the Lord's Supper is retained in many cases
and is regarded as a memorial. The baptism (or 'dedication') of infants is also practised.

Ministerial ordination is not considered as imparting supernatural gifts, but as a solemnity
marking the entrance of the accredited person into full recognition and office. The congregation
makes its own choice of a minister, though in case of its dependence upon outside financial
assistance the advice of the managers of the Fund may be offered. The support of the churches
and Sunday-schools, etc., is generally by voluntary contributions; endowments exist in some
instances. Church membership is usually granted without insistence upon any religious declaration.
New buildings are invariably associated with the 'open trust' principle, the way being thus
left open for such changes in worship and opinion as may hereafter seem right. Some churches
decline to be known as 'Unitarian,' and where that name is adopted it is usual to find with
it the explanation that this does not pledge or limit future development or bar the widest
religious sympathy in the present.

Reference has been made to Sunday-schools. In this field Unitarians have always been pioneers,
and their aims have usually been to promote culture without sectarian zeal. Many large schools
continue, as in the past, to form centres of education of the widest type, not only to children
but adults. Much interest is taken in social amelioration; some observers have asserted that
this interest is more vivid in many quarters than any in matters theological or philosophical.

Statements of the teachings usually accepted in the churches are numerous. One here quoted
will fairly represent the general type. It was drawn up by Richard Acland Armstrong (1843-1905),
an eager social reformer, a powerful preacher and author, and memorable especially as a popularizer
of Martineau's religious philosophy. Of course, from what has been already said, such a statement
is not regarded as an authoritative creed, but simply takes its place as one out of many summaries
for popular diffusion.

'Unitarian Christianity teaches that God is our Father, full of love for all of us. It learns
from Jesus that the Father listens to our prayers and watches over us with even more tender
care than over the lilies of the field and the birds of the air.

'It learns from Jesus too, that however important it may be to have correct views concerning
religious matters, it is much more important to love God with all our heart and mind and soul
and strength, and our neighbour as ourselves. For he says that these are the first two commandments,
and that there is no other whatever that is greater than these.

'It learns from Jesus, also, that the way to enter the kingdom of Heaven is, not merely to
hold a correct theology or to receive any outward sacraments, but to "be converted and become
as little children"--simple-hearted, loving, pure.

'Unitarian Christianity teaches that God our Father claims us all as children, and that when
Jesus speaks of himself as God's Son, he means us all to remember that we are God's children
too, though unhappily we have stained our sonship and daughterhood with many unworthy thoughts
and deeds.

'Unitarian Christianity loves the Parable of the Prodigal Son, because it shows so clearly
and so beautifully the love and forgiveness of God, and with what tender pity he looks on us
when we have sinned.

'Unitarian Christianity believes that God speaks to his children now as truly as he did to
the Prophets of old and to Jesus Christ, comforting, strengthening, enlightening them. Conscience
itself is his holy voice.

'Unitarian Christianity sees in Jesus Christ a supremely beautiful life and character, a marvellous
inspiration for us all, an ideal after which we may strive; and it loves to think of him as
our Elder Brother, of the same nature as ourselves.

'Unitarian Christianity does not believe that God will plunge any of his children into everlasting
woe. Such a thought of God is a contradiction of his Fatherhood. He is leading us all, by different
ways, towards the pure and holy life for which he brought us into being.'

Along with this may be taken the declaration adopted, as a result of somewhat protracted discussions,
at the National Conference of Unitarians in America, 1894; it would probably be accepted in
all similar assemblies. The Universalists, who are strongest in the United States, are cordially
fraternal with them; and a large proportion of the 'Christians'--a non-dogmatic body--are equally
close in sympathy. The Hicksite Friends, named after Elias Hicks, who early in the nineteenth
century avowed Anti-trinitarian views, and some other religious bodies less conspicuous are
more or less directly included in the Unitarian forces, though not organically in union. With
the French Liberal Protestants there has been warm co-operation for many years, and the same
is true of Dutch, German, and Swiss reformers. Since the visit of Rammohun Roy, the Indian
reformer, in 1833, the English in particular have developed kindly relations with the Indian
theist movement, and students from India and Japan are regularly educated at Oxford for the
ministry of free religion in their own countries. It is in this way, more than by the ordinary
types of missionary activity, that Unitarians have hitherto attempted to influence the non-Christian
races.

During recent years there have been held international congresses promoted by the Unitarians
of Great Britain, America, and Transylvania, and attended by representatives of the various
sections just named as well as by others from the orthodox churches, including Anglican and
Romanist, who venture to brave the authorities thus far. Proposals have already been made for
a world-wide union of Religious Liberals, in view of the remarkable success of these great
congresses; but the circumstances of the different groups, especially in Germany and Holland,
seem to forbid expectation of such a development within any near period. On the whole, Unitarians
appear to be encouraged by the signs of the times, and to do their share of religious culture
and benevolent work while cultivating the friendship of 'Modernists' of all kinds, Christian,
Jewish, Moslem, and Hindoo.
