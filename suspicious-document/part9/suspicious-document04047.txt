CANTO XI

"O thou Almighty Father, who dost make The heavens thy dwelling, not in bounds confin'd, But
that with love intenser there thou view'st Thy primal effluence, hallow'd be thy name: Join
each created being to extol Thy might, for worthy humblest thanks and praise Is thy blest Spirit.
May thy kingdom's peace Come unto us; for we, unless it come, With all our striving thither
tend in vain. As of their will the angels unto thee Tender meet sacrifice, circling thy throne
With loud hosannas, so of theirs be done By saintly men on earth.  Grant us this day Our daily
manna, without which he roams Through this rough desert retrograde, who most Toils to advance
his steps.  As we to each Pardon the evil done us, pardon thou Benign, and of our merit take
no count. 'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not Our virtue easily subdu'd; but free From
his incitements and defeat his wiles. This last petition, dearest Lord! is made Not for ourselves,
since that were needless now, But for their sakes who after us remain."

Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring, Those spirits went beneath a weight like that
We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset, But with unequal anguish, wearied all, Round
the first circuit, purging as they go, The world's gross darkness off: In our behalf If there
vows still be offer'd, what can here For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills Have root
of goodness in them? And if there be more passages than one, Instruct us of that easiest to
ascend; For this man who comes with me, and bears yet The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left
him, Despite his better will but slowly mounts." From whom the answer came unto these words,
Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said:

"Along the bank to rightward come with us, And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil Of
living man to climb: and were it not That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith This arrogant
neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives, Whose name
thou speak'st not him I fain would view. To mark if e'er I knew himnd to crave His pity for
the fardel that I bear. I was of Latiun,  of a Tuscan horn A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name
My sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard. My old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds Made
me so haughty, that I clean forgot The common mother, and to such excess, Wax'd in my scorn
of all men, that I fell, Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons, Each child in Campagnatico,
can tell. I am Omberto; not me only pride Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd In mischief
with her.  Here my lot ordains Under this weight to groan, till I appease God's angry justice,
since I did it not Amongst the living, here amongst the dead."

List'ning I bent my visage down: and one (Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight That
urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd, Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd Intent
upon me, stooping as I went Companion of their way.  "O!" In truth I had not been thus courteous
to him, The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal For that pre-eminence my heart was bent
on. Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid. Nor were I even here; if, able still To sin,
I had not turn'd me unto God. O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp'd E'en in its height
of verdure, if an age Less bright succeed not! imbue thought To lord it over painting's field;
and now The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd. Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd
The letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born, Who shall drive either from their nest.  The noise
Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind, That blows from divers points, and shifts its name
Shifting the point it blows from.  Shalt thou more Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh
Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died, Before the coral and the pap were left,
Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that Is, to eternity compar'd, a space, Briefer
than is the twinkling of an eye To the heaven's slowest orb.  He there who treads So leisurely
before me, far and wide Through Tuscany resounded once; and now Is in Sienna scarce with whispers
nam'd: There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught The madd'ning rage of Florence, in that
day Proud as she now is loathsome.  Your renown Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,
And his might withers it, by whom it sprang Crude from the lap of earth."  I thus to him: "True
are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay What tumours
rankle there.  But who is he Of whom thou spak'st but now?"--"This," he replied, "Is Provenzano.
He is here, because He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway Of all Sienna.  Thus he
still hath gone, Thus goeth never-resting, since he died. Such is th' acquittance render'd
back of him, Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth."  I then: "If soul that to the verge of life
delays Repentance, linger in that lower space, Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,
How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?"  More I will not say; and dark, I know, my words
are, but thy neighbours soon Shall help thee to a comment on the text. This is the work, that
from these limits freed him."

As in memorial of the buried, drawn Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form Of what was
once, appears (at sight whereof Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd, Whose sacred
stings the piteous only feel), So saw I there, but with more curious skill Of portraiture o'erwrought,
whate'er of space From forth the mountain stretches.  On one part Him I beheld, above all creatures
erst Created noblest, light'ning fall from heaven: On th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd
Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint Of mortal ice-stroke.  The Thymbraean god With
Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire, Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs Strewn
o'er th' ethereal field.  Nimrod I saw: At foot of the stupendous work he stood, As if bewilder'd,
looking on the crowd Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.

O Niobe! in what a trance of woe Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn, Sev'n sons on either
side thee slain!  Saul! How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword Expiring in Gilboa,
from that hour Ne'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!

O fond Arachne! thee I also saw Half spider now in anguish crawling up Th' unfinish'd web thou
weaved'st to thy bane!

O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote With none to
chase him in his chariot whirl'd.

Was shown beside upon the solid floor How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate That ornament
in evil hour receiv'd: How in the temple on Sennacherib fell His sons, and how a corpse they
left him there. Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:
"Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!" Was shown how routed in the battle fled
Th' Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en The relics of the carnage.  Troy I mark'd In ashes
and in caverns.  Oh! how fall'n, How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!  Now swell out;
and with stiff necks Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks, Lest they descry the evil
of your path!

I noted not (so busied was my thought) How much we now had circled of the mount, And of his
course yet more the sun had spent, When he, who with still wakeful caution went, Admonish'd:
"Raise thou up thy head: for know Time is not now for slow suspense.  Behold That way an angel
hasting towards us!  Lo! Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return From service on the day.
Wear thou in look And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe, That gladly he may forward us aloft.
Consider that this day ne'er dawns again."

Time's loss he had so often warn'd me 'gainst, I could not miss the scope at which he aim'd.

The goodly shape approach'd us, snowy white In vesture, and with visage casting streams Of
tremulous lustre like the matin star. His arms he open'd, then his wings; and spake: "Onward:
the steps, behold! are near; and now Th' ascent is without difficulty gain'd."

A scanty few are they, who when they hear Such tidings, hasten.  O ye race of men Though born
to soar, why suffer ye a wind So slight to baffle ye?  He led us on Where the rock parted;
here against my front Did beat his wings, then promis'd I should fare In safety on my way.
As to ascend That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands (O'er Rubaconte, looking lordly
down On the well-guided city,) up the right Th' impetuous rise is broken by the steps Carv'd
in that old and simple age, when still The registry and label rested safe; Thus is th' acclivity
reliev'd, which here Precipitous from the other circuit falls: But on each hand the tall cliff
presses close.

As ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain Ineffable, sang: "Blessed are the poor In spirit."
Ah how far unlike to these The straits of hell; here songs to usher us, There shrieks of woe!
We climb the holy stairs: And lighter to myself by far I seem'd Than on the plain before, whence
thus I spake: "Say, master, of what heavy thing have I Been lighten'd, that scarce aught the
sense of toil Affects me journeying?"  He in few replied: "When sin's broad characters, that
yet remain Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac'd, Shall be, as one is, all clean razed
out, Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will Be so o'ercome, they not alone shall feel No
sense of labour, but delight much more Shall wait them urg'd along their upward way." 

Option, pleasure, is thus very action, but it has truly to it; by we are today annoying and penalize
ourselves, an wrongdoer off will to have been a anorexic. Property: like i who to hand is lavishly

over us, is mourn'd. Account of that division tripartite Expect not, fitter for thine own research."
