The effect of this second proclamation of the British commander was such as he scarcely anticipated.
The readiness with which numbers of the people had accepted paroles and protections, declared,
at most, nothing but their indifference to the contest--declared no preference for British
domination. In this lay the error of the conqueror. The natural feeling of the people, thus
entrapped, was that of indignation. Their determination might have been conjectured by any
reasoning mind. Compelled to take up arms--not permitted to enjoy that repose with their families,
for which they sought the offered immunities of the British--it was more easy to espouse the
cause of their countrymen, to which their affections were really given, than that of the invader.
They had committed a great and humbling error in the endeavor to escape the conflict--in taking
the proffered protection of a power which had seized with violence upon their native land.
It was with some eagerness, therefore, that they threw aside its obligations, and, as opportunity
presented itself, girded on their armor, and sallied forth to join their countrymen. When a

 There
were other branches of this family who partook largely of the qualities of the five brothers.
Of these, the eldest, Major John James, was chosen the representative of the men of Williamsburg.
This gentleman had been their representative in the provincial assembly--he was in command
of them as State militia. They gave him their fullest confidence, and he deserved it.

Under this appointment, Major James repaired to Georgetown, the nearest British post, which
was then under the command of one Captain Ardesoif. Attired as a plain backwoodsman, James
obtained an interview with Ardesoif, and, in prompt and plain terms, entered at once upon the
business for which he came. But when he demanded the meaning of the British protection, and
asked upon what terms the submission of the citizens was to be made, he was peremptorily informed
that "the submission must be unconditional." To an inquiry, whether the inhabitants were to
be allowed to remain upon their plantations, he was answered in the negative. "His Majesty,"
said Ardesoif, "offers you a free pardon, of which you are undeserving, for you all ought to
be hanged; but it is only on condition that you take up arms in his cause." James, whom we
may suppose to have been very far from relishing the tone and language in which he was addressed,
very coolly replied, that "the people whom he came to REPRESENT, would scarcely submit on such
conditions." The republican language of the worthy Major provoked the representative of Royalty.
The word 'represent', in particular, smote hardly on his ears; something, too, in the cool,
contemptuous manner of the Major, may have contributed to his vexation. "REPRESENT!" he exclaimed
in a fury--"You d----d rebel, if you dare speak in such language, I will have you hung up at
the yard-arm!" Ardesoif, it must be known, was a sea captain. The ship which he commanded lay
in the neighboring river. He used only a habitual form of speech when he threatened the "yard-arm",
instead of the tree. Publication Personnel, through the s of boundlessly twenty 1000000 to three eightvo
under his concern has been issued under his protection.

Such regimentals show rather the exigencies than the tastes of our partisan. This scarlet cloth,
of which his vest was made, was almost the only kind of color which the Carolinians could procure
after the conquest of Charleston. The British seemed to distribute it with the protections
and pardons, perhaps as a popular mode of disseminating their principles. Moultrie somewhere
tells a ludicrous anecdote of some Americans (prisoners on parole) who were nearly cut to pieces
by a party of their countrymen, in consequence of their scarlet jackets. They had taken the
precaution to dye them with some native roots, but the dye had disappeared, leaving the original
color nearly as vivid as before.

According to Weems, Marion made rather a theatrical display on taking command of his brigade.
He swore them in a circle upon their swords, never to yield the contest until they had secured
their own and the liberties of their country. There is no authority for this statement, either
in the work of James, in the MS. of Horry, or in any of the authorities. There is no doubt
that such were his own sentiments, and such the sentiments which he strove to impart to all
his followers; but the scene as described by the reverend historian was quite too artificial
and theatrical for the tastes of Marion. It does not accord with what we know of his modesty,
his unaffected nature, and the general simplicity of his manners. He instilled his lessons
by examples rather than by speeches. His words were usually very few. He secured the fidelity
of his men by carrying them bravely into action, and bringing them honorably out of it.

Marion's career of activity commenced with his command. Though always prudent, he yet learned
that prudence in military life must always imply activity. The insecurity of the encampment,
with a militia force, is always greater than that of battle. The Roman captains of celebrity
were particularly aware of this truth. But the activity of Marion was necessarily straitened
by the condition in which he found his men. They were wretchedly deficient in all the materials
of service. His first effort to supply some of their wants, was in sacking the saw-mills. The
saws were wrought and hammered by rude blacksmiths into some resemblance to sabres, and thus
provided, Marion set his men in motion, two days after taking the command. Crossing the Pedee
at Port's Ferry, he advanced upon a large body of Tories commanded by Major Gainey, who held
a position upon Britton's Neck. Gainey was considered by the British an excellent partisan
officer, but he was caught napping. Marion moved with equal secrecy and celerity. After riding
all night, he came upon the enemy at dawn in the morning. The discovery and the attack were
one. The surprise was complete. A captain and several privates were slain, and the party dispersed.
Marion did not lose a man, and had but two wounded. In this engagement, our representative,
Major James, distinguished himself, by singling out Major Gainey for personal combat. But Gainey
shrank from his more powerful assailant, and sought safety in flight. James pursued for a distance
of half a mile. In the eagerness of the chase he did not perceive that he was alone and unsupported.
It was enough that he was gaining upon his enemy, who was almost within reach of his sword,
when the chase brought them suddenly upon a body of Tories who had rallied upon the road. There
was not a moment to be lost. Hesitation would have been fatal. But our gallant Major was not
to be easily intimidated. With great coolness and presence of mind, waving his sword aloft,
he cried out, "come on, boys! here they are!" and rushed headlong upon the group of enemies,
as if perfectly assured of support. The ruse was successful. The Tories broke once more, and
sought safety from their individual enemy in the recesses of Pedee swamp.

Marion did not suffer the courage of his men to cool. In twenty-four hours after this event,
he was again in motion. Hearing of the proximity of another body of Tories, under Captain Barfield,
he advanced against him with as much celerity and caution as before. But he found Barfield
strongly posted, in greater force than he expected; warned of his approach and waiting for
him. It was no part of Marion's practice to expose his men unnecessarily. He had too few, to
risk the loss of any precious lives, where this was to be avoided. He determined upon a different
mode of managing his enemy, and resorted to a stratagem, which, subsequently, he frequently
made use of. Putting a select party of his men in ambush near the Blue Savannah, he feigned
retreat with another, and thus beguiled his enemy from his strong position. The result accorded
with his wishes. Barfield followed and fell into the snare. The defeat was equally complete
with that of Gainey.

The conduct and skill, in managing his raw militia-men, which these two achievements displayed,
naturally inspired his followers with confidence in themselves and their leader. They produced
a corresponding effect upon the people of the country, and were productive of no small annoyance
to the Tories, who were thus suddenly reminded that there might be retribution for crime even
when sheltered under the dragon folds of England. Another benefit from these occurrences was
in better providing the brigade with some of the proper weapons and munitions of war.

Among the recent captures of Marion were two old field-pieces. Returning to Port's Ferry, he
threw up a redoubt on the east bank of the Pedee, upon which he mounted them. He seldom troubled
himself with such heavy baggage, and probably disposed of them in this way, quite as much to
disencumber himself of them, as with any such motive, as was alleged, when placing them in
battery, of overawing the Tories by their presence. Movements of so rapid a kind, and so frequently
made as his, requiring equal dispatch and secrecy, forbade the use of artillery; and he very
well knew, that, to employ men for the maintenance of isolated posts--such posts as he could
establish,--would have no other effect than to expose his brigade to the chances of being cut
up in detail.

 It may be that they were somewhat loth to be led, even
though it were to victory, by the man whose ludicrous equipments and followers, but a few weeks
before, had only provoked their merriment. The reason given for their refusal, however, was
not deficient in force. "They considered the cause of the country to be hopeless. They were
risking life without an adequate object." The defeat of Gates, and his bad generalship, which
they had so recently witnessed, were, perhaps, quite sufficient reasons to justify their misgivings.

This disastrous event did not produce like despondency in our partisan or his followers, though
it furnished reasons for the greatest circumspection. At this moment Marion's was the only
body of American troops in the State, openly opposed to the triumphant progress of the British.
The Continentals were dispersed or captured; the Virginia and North Carolina militia scattered
to the four winds; Sumter's legion cut up by Tarleton, and he himself a fugitive, fearless
and active still, but as yet seeking, rather than commanding, a force. Though small and seemingly
insignificant, the force of Marion had shown what might be done, with the spirit and the personnel
of the country, under competent leaders. The cruelties of the British, who subjected the vanquished
to the worst treatment of war, helped his endeavors.

This gentleman has been called, by some of the American writers, the "amiable Cornwallis".
It is rather difficult to say for which of his qualities this dulcet epithet was bestowed.
The preceding may well justify us in the doubt we venture to express, whether it was not given
as much in mockery as compliment. But, lest his commands should not be understood, as not sufficiently
explicit, his Lordship proceeded to furnish examples of his meaning, which left his desires
beyond reasonable question. Immediately after his return to Camden, he stained the laurels
of his recent victory, and celebrated his triumph over Gates, by hanging some twelve or fifteen
wretched prisoners, old men and boys, who were only suspected of treachery to the royal cause.
Similar barbarities were practised by subordinate officers, emulative of this example of their
superior, or in obedience to his orders. But, fortunately for the country, even this brutality,
which was intended to alarm the fears of the people, and do that which the arts of their conqueror
had failed to effect, was not productive of the desired results. It drove the indignant into
the field--it shamed the unwilling into decision--it spurred on the inert and inactive to exertion,
and armed the doubtful and the timid with resolution. It sent hundreds, whom nothing had moved
before, into the ranks of Marion and Sumter. The moment of defeat and greatest despondency--the
dark before the dawn--was that when the people of the country were preparing to display the
most animating signs of life. The very fact that the force of Marion was so insignificant,
was something in favor of that courage and patriotism, that confidence in his own resources
and his men, which, defying all the inequalities of force, could move him to traverse the very
paths of the conqueror, and pluck his prisoners from his very grasp. The audacity and skill
of Marion, exhibited in numerous small achievements of which history furnishes no particulars,
extorted a reluctant confession from the enemy, whose unwilling language will suffice for our
own. Tarleton writes: "MR. Marion,* by his zeal and abilities, showed himself capable of the
trust committed to his charge. He collected his adherents at the shortest notice, and, after
making excursions into the friendly districts, or threatening the communications, to avoid
pursuit he disbanded his followers. The alarms occasioned by these insurrections, frequently
retarded supplies on their way to the army; and a late report of Marion's strength delayed
the junction of the recruits who had arrived from New York for the corps in the country." The
64th Regiment of Infantry was ordered to Nelson's Ferry from Charleston, and directions were
given to Lieut. Col. Tarleton to pass the Wateree to awe the insurgents.** Cornwallis writes
to Tarleton: "I most sincerely hope that you will get at MR. Marion." In short, to use the
further language of the British Colonel, Marion completely overran the lower districts. He
cut off supplies from the army, broke up the Tories, destroyed recruiting parties, intercepted
and interrupted communications, and, darting to and fro between the British posts, which he
had not the power to overcome, showed that nothing but that power was necessary to enable him
to challenge with them the possession of the soil. That he should disband his men at one moment,
and be able by a word to bring them together when they were again wanted, proves a singular
alliance between the chieftain and his followers, which is characteristic only of the most
romantic history. It shows a power, on the part of the former, such as we ascribe to the winding
of the magic horn of Astolfo, which few commanders of militia have ever had the skill to produce.
Evidently, the personal and patriotic influences were very equally strong, to occasion such
prompt fidelity, in his case, on the part of his followers.

     * The British officers betrayed a singular reluctance to
     accord to the Americans their military titles. The reader
     will recollect the letter of General Gage to MR. Washington,
     which the latter very properly refused to receive. The very
     attempt here made to sneer away the official, adds to the
     personal importance of the individual; and we yield to plain
     Mr. Marion, with his ragged followers, who, untitled, could
     give such annoyance to His Majesty's officers, a degree of
     respect which his title might not otherwise have commanded.

The solicitude manifested by the British commander in the South to get Marion from his path,
soon set the legion of Tarleton, and a strong force under Major Wemyss, in motion for his retreats.
The progress of Tarleton was somewhat delayed, and his cooperation with Wemyss prevented. The
latter pushed his advance with equal spirit and address. Marion had with him but one hundred
and fifty men, when he heard of the approach of his enemies. His force, it must be remembered,
was of a peculiar kind, and was constantly fluctuating. His men had cares other than those
of their country's liberties. Young and tender families were to be provided for and guarded
in the thickets where they found shelter. These were often threatened in the absence of their
protectors by marauding bands of Tories, who watched the moment of the departure of the Whigs,
to rise upon the weak, and rob and harass the unprotected. The citizen soldiery were thus doubly
employed, and had cares to endure, and duties to perform, from which regular troops are usually
exempt, and for which regular officers seldom make allowance. The good judgment of Marion,
taking these necessities into consideration, exercised that patience with the militia which
secured their fidelity. When he found this or that body of men anxious about their families,
he yielded most generally without reluctance to their wishes. This indulgence had its effects.
Their return was certain. They seldom lingered beyond the time at which they had pledged themselves
to reappear.

It was in consequence of this indulgence that his force was thus reduced when the British approach
was known. Wemyss was in command of the 63d regiment. He was accompanied by a large body of
Tories under Major Harrison. They moved with caution and speed, but the American General was
on the alert. He dispatched Major James with a select body of volunteers to reconnoitre. His
various outposts were called in, and with his whole present strength, thus united, Marion followed
on the footsteps of James, prepared, if the chances promised him success, for doing battle
with his enemy.

Major James, meanwhile, who was equally bold and skilful, pressed forward fearlessly till he
became aware of the proximity of the British. He was resolved to make sure of his intelligence.
He placed himself in a thicket on their line of march, and by a bright moon, was readily enabled
to form a very correct notion of their character and numbers. But as the rear-guard passed
by, his courageous spirit prompted further performances. He was not content to carry to his
general no other proofs of his vigilance but the tidings which he had obtained. His perfect
knowledge of the ground, his confidence in the excellent character of his men, and the speed
of their horses, moved him to greater daring; and, bursting from his hiding-place, with a terrible
shout, he swooped down with his small party upon the startled stragglers in the rear of the
Tory march, carrying off his prisoners in the twinkling of an eye, without stopping to slay,
and without suffering the loss of a man. Before the enemy could rally, and turn upon his path,
the tread of the partisan's horse no longer sounded in his ears.

The intelligence which James bore to his commander was scarcely so encouraging. He reported
the British regulars to be double their own force in number, while the Tories in the rear were
alone estimated at five hundred men. Retreat, perhaps dispersion, was now inevitable. This
was the sort of game, which, in his feebleness, and under the pressure of a very superior foe,
our partisan was compelled to play. It was sometimes a humiliating one, and always attended
with some discouragements. The evil effects, however, were only temporary. His men never retired
beyond his reach. They came again at a call, refreshed by the respite, and assured by the conviction
that their commander was quite as careful of their lives as themselves. Such a game was not
without its interest, and its peculiarities were such as to give animation to the valor which
it exercised. In these peculiarities of his warfare, lies that secret charm which has made
tradition, in the southern country, linger so long and so fondly upon the name of Marion.

Judge James gives us, in few words, a lively idea of the consultation which followed the return
and the report of Major James. "About an hour before day, Marion met the Major half a mile
from his plantation. The officers immediately dismounted and retired to consult; the men sat
on their horses in a state of anxious suspense. The conference was long and animated. At the
end of it, an order was given to direct the march back to Lynch's Creek (the route to North
Carolina), and no sooner was it given than a bitter groan might have been heard along the whole
line. A bitter cup had now been mingled for the people of Williamsburg and Pedee, and they
were doomed to drain it to the dregs, but in the end it proved a salutary medicine."

The evil here deplored was the temporary abandonment, for the first time, of this particular
section of country. Hitherto, the enemy had never appeared in their neighborhood with such
a force as enabled them to overrun it without fear of opposition. Now, they were destined to
suffer from those tender mercies of British and Tories, which had written their chronicles
in blood and flame, wherever their footsteps had gone before. Bitter, indeed, was the medicine,
to whom its taste was new. But, as writes the venerable biographer, it was salutary in the
end. It strengthened their souls for the future trial. It made them more resolute in the play.
With their own houses in smoking ruins, and their own wives and children homeless and wandering,
they could better feel what was due to the sufferings of their common country.

It was at sunset the next evening that Marion commenced his flight to North Carolina. He kept
with him only sixty men. The rest dropped off by degrees as they approached their several hiding-places,
lying snug, until they again heard the signal of their commander,--frequently nothing but a
whisper,--which once more brought them forth, to turn the pursuit upon their enemies and avenge
themselves by sudden onslaught for the ruin of their homesteads. On this retreat, Marion took
with him the two field-pieces which we found him placing in battery on the Pedee a short time
before. His desire to save these pieces was due rather to the supposed effect which their possession
had upon the minds of the Tories, than because of any real intrinsic use which they possessed
in his hands. They encumbered his flight, however, and he disposed of them, finally, without
compunction. Wheeling them into a swamp he left them, where, possibly, they remain to this
day, the object of occasional start and wonderment to the stalking deer-hunter. This, says
Judge James, "was the last instance of military parade evinced by the General." Marching day
and night he arrived at Amy's Mill, on Drowning Creek. From this place, he sent forth his parties,
back to South Carolina, to gain intelligence and rouse the militia. He himself continued his
march. He pitched his camp finally, on the east side of the White Marsh, near the head of the
Waccamaw. There may have been a motive, other than the desire for safety, which led Marion
to choose and retain this position. The borders of North Carolina swarmed with Tories, chiefly
descendants of the Scotch, who constituted, on frequent subsequent occasions, the perplexing
enemies with whom our partisan had to contend. It is not improbable, though history does not
declare the fact, that he chose the present occasion for overawing the scattered parties, who
were always stretching with lawless footsteps from Cape Fear to the Great Pedee. It was while
he lay at this place, that the venerable Judge James, then a boy of sixteen, had the honor,
for the first time, to dine with Marion. It was in the absence of Major James, the father of
the boy, who was one of the volunteers sent back to South Carolina. The artless description
which the Judge has given us of this event, so characteristic of Marion, and of the necessities
to which he was habitually compelled to submit, will better please than a much more elaborate
narrative.

"The dinner was set before the company by the General's servant, Oscar, partly on a pine log
and partly on the ground. It consisted of lean beef, without salt, and sweet potatoes. The
author had left a small pot of boiled hominy in his camp, and requested leave of his host to
send for it, and the proposal was gladly acquiesced in. The hominy had salt in it, and proved,
though eaten out of the pot, a most acceptable repast. The General said but little, and that
was chiefly what a son would be most likely to be gratified by, in the praise of his father.
We had nothing to drink but bad water; and all the company appeared to be rather grave."

That the party should be rather grave, flying from their homes and a superior foe, eating unsalted
pottage, and drinking bad water, was, perhaps, natural enough. That this gravity should appear
doubly impressive to a lad of sixteen, in a presence which he was taught to venerate, was still
more likely to be the case. But Marion, though a cheerful man, wore ordinarily a grave, sedate
expression of countenance. Never darkened by gloom, it was seldom usurped by mere merriment.
He had no uproarious humor. His tastes were delicate, his habits gentle, his sensibilities
warm and watchful. At most a quiet smile lighted up his features, and he could deal in little
gushes of humor, of which there was a precious fountain at the bottom of his heart. That he
was capable of a sharp sarcasm, was also generally understood among his friends. Horry remarks,
that few men ever excelled him at retort. But he was singularly considerate of the sensibilities
of others, and had his temper under rare command. His powers of forbearance were remarkable.
His demeanor, whether in triumph or despondency, was equally quiet and subdued. He yielded
to few excitements, was seldom elevated by successes to imprudence--as seldom depressed by
disappointments to despondency. The equable tone of his mind reminds us again of Washington.

It was while Marion remained at White Marsh, that one of his captains, Gavin Witherspoon, whom
he had sent out with four men, achieved one of those clever performances, that so frequently
distinguished the men of Marion. He had taken refuge in Pedee Swamp from the pursuit of the
enemy, and, while hiding, discovered one of the camps of the Tories who had been in pursuit
of him. Witherspoon proposed to his four comrades to watch the enemy's camp, until the Tories
were asleep. But his men timidly shrunk from the performance, expressing their dread of superior
numbers. Witherspoon undertook the adventure himself. Creeping up to the encampment, he found
that they slept at the butt of a pine tree, which had been torn up by the roots. Their guns
were piled against one of its branches at a little distance from them. These he first determined
to secure, and, still creeping, with the skill and caution of an experienced scout, he succeeded
in his object. The guns once in his possession, he aroused the Tories by commanding their surrender.
They were seven in number, unarmed, and knew nothing of the force of the assailant. His own
more timid followers drew near in sufficient time to assist in securing the prisoners. There
was another Witherspoon with Marion, John, a brother of Gavin, and like him distinguished for
great coolness, strength, and courage. Both of the brothers delighted in such adventures, and
were always ready to engage in them,--the rashness of the attempt giving a sort of relish to
the danger, which always sweetened it to the taste of our partisans.

The return of the various scouting parties which Marion sent out, soon set his little brigade
in motion. The intelligence which they brought was well calculated to sting his soldiers, as
well as himself, into immediate activity. The medicine which the British had administered to
the country they abandoned, had not been suffered to lose any of its bitterness. As had been
feared, the Tories had laid waste the farms and plantations. The region through which Major
Wemyss had passed, for seventy miles in length and fifteen in breadth, displayed one broad
face of desolation. It had been swept by sword and fire. Havoc had exercised its most ingenious
powers of destruction. On most of the plantations the houses were given to the flames, the
inhabitants plundered of all their possessions, and the stock, especially the sheep, wantonly
shot or bayoneted. Wemyss seems to have been particularly hostile to looms and sheep, simply
because they supplied the inhabitants with clothing. He seldom suffered the furniture to be
withdrawn from a dwelling which he had doomed to be destroyed: Presbyterian churches he burnt
religiously, as so many "sedition-shops". It was fortunate for the wretched country, thus ravaged,
that the corn was not generally housed; it was only in part destroyed. Had the Tories played
the same game in the cornfields of the patriots, that Grant's men had done in those of the
Cherokees, as recorded in an early page of this volume,* the devastation would have been complete.
They had not limited their proceedings to these minor crimes. They had added human butchery
and hanging to those other offences for which vengeance was in store. The wife and children
of one Adam Cusack, threw themselves across the path of Wemyss to obtain the pardon of the
husband and the father. The crime of Cusack was in having taken arms against the enemy. Their
prayers were in vain. But for the interference of his own officers, the ruthless Briton would
have ridden over the kneeling innocents. This was not the only savage murder of the same description
which this wretched people had to endure. But such atrocities were sharp medicines, benefits
in disguise, good against cowardice, selfishness, double-dealing, and deficient patriotism.
They worked famously upon the natives, while they proved the invader to be as little capable
of good policy, as of ordinary humanity. They roused the spirit of the militia, whet their
anger and their swords together, and, by the time that Marion reappeared, they were ready for
their General. He asked for nothing more. He re-entered South Carolina by a forced march. Travelling
night and day, he hurried through the Tory settlements on Little Pedee, a space of sixty miles,
on the second day of his journey. At Lynch's Creek he was joined by Captains James and Mouzon,
with a considerable body of men. He was prepared to give them instant employment. Major Wemyss
had retired to Georgetown, but Marion was advised of a large body of Tories at Black Mingo,
fifteen miles below, under the command of Capt. John Coming Ball. Marion was in expectation,
every moment, of additional troops, but he determined not to wait for them. He found his men
in the proper mood for fight, and at such times small inequalities of force are not to be regarded.
He resolved to give the humor vent, and at once commenced his march for the enemy's encampment.
He found the Tories strongly posted at Shepherd's Ferry, on the south side of the Black Mingo,
on a deep navigable stream, the passage of which they commanded. There was but one other approach
to them, about a mile above their position, through a boggy causeway, and over a bridge of
planks. It was nearly midnight when Marion's troops reached this pass. While the horses were
crossing the bridge, an alarm-gun was heard from the Tory camp. Celerity now became as necessary
to success as caution, and Marion ordered his men to follow him at full gallop. When they reached
the main road, about three hundred yards from the enemy, the whole force, with the exception
of a small body acting as cavalry, dismounted. A body of picked men, under Captain Waties,
was ordered down the road to attack Dollard's house, where the Tories had been posted. Two
companies, under Col. Hugh Horry, were sent to the right, and the cavalry to the left, to support
the attack, Marion himself bringing up the reserve. It so happened, however, that the Tories
had taken the alarm, and having withdrawn from the house, had chosen a strong position in an
old field near it. Here they encountered Horry's command, on the advance, with a fire equally
severe and unexpected. The effect was that of a surprise upon the assailants. Horry's troops
fell back in confusion, but were promptly rallied and brought to the charge. The battle was
obstinate and bloody, but the appearance of the corps under Waties, suddenly, in the rear of
the Tories, soon brought it to a close. Finding themselves between two fires, the enemy gave
way in all directions, and fled for refuge to the neighboring swamp of Black Mingo. So warmly
contested was this affair, that, though soon over, fully one third of the men brought into
the field were put 'hors de combat'. The loss of Marion was proportionably very considerable.
Captain Logan was among his slain; and Captain Mouzon and Lieut. Scott so severely wounded
as to be unfit for future service. The force of the Tories was almost twice as great as that
of the Whigs. They lost their commander, and left nearly half their number, killed and wounded,
on the ground. But for the alarm given by the tread of Marion's horses, while crossing the
neighboring bridge, the Tories would most probably have been surprised. At any rate, the affair
would have been settled without subjecting the brigade to the severe loss which it sustained.
After this event Marion adopted the precaution, whenever about to cross a bridge by night,
with an enemy near, to cover the planks with the blankets of his men. But he generally preferred
fords, where they could possibly be had, to bridges.

     * See ante, pp. 50-52 [End of Chapter 4].--

This victory was very complete. Many of the Tories came in, and joined the ranks of the conqueror.
Those who did not, were quite too much confounded to show much impatience in taking up arms
against him. His uniform successes, whenever he struck, had already strongly impressed the
imaginations of the people. His name was already the rallying word throughout the country.
To join Marion, to be one of Marion's men, was the duty which the grandsire imposed upon the
lad, and to the performance of which, throwing aside his crutch, he led the way.

We have already shown why the force of Marion was so liable to fluctuation. The necessity of
providing for, and protecting destitute families, starving wives and naked children, was more
imperative than that of a remote and fancied liberty. These cases attended to, the militia
came forth, struck a few blows, and once more returned to their destitute dependents. The victory
over the Tories of Black Mingo, was, from this cause, followed by a more than usually prolonged
inactivity of our partisan. His men demanded a respite to go and see their families. He consented,
with some reluctance, for the business of the campaign was only beginning to open itself before
him. They promised him, as usual, to return in season; but remained so long absent, that, for
the first time, he now began to doubt and despair of them. This feeling was not natural with
him. It was probably only due now to some derangement of his own health, some anxiety to achieve
objects which presented themselves prominently to his mind. He had probably heard of the advance
of General Greene, who, having succeeded to Gates, was pressing forward with fresh recruits,
and the remnant of the fugitives who survived, in freedom, the fatal battle of Camden. Christophe'.

 He could, at any time and in a few minutes, have plunged into it, and no regular
body of cavalry could have followed him. Besides, so close, we are told, was the pursuit, that
the dragoons were taking prisoners. The enemy must have been overtaken, but for the express.
Under such circumstances it seems strange that Tarleton should show such singular deference
to the express as to forbear the blow, when his sabre was already uplifted, and one of his
most troublesome enemies was actually beneath it. It is scarcely possible that, with his dragoons
so close on the heels of the fugitives and informed by prisoners of the proximity of his foe,
he should not have heard that he was finally posted and in waiting for him. We will suppose,
however, that he did not. He turned the head of his column at the very moment when his object
was attainable. Popular tradition represents him as expressing himself discouraged at the sight
of Ox swamp, and exclaiming, "Come, my boys! let us go back. We will soon find the 'Game Cock'
(meaning Sumter), but as for this d----d 'Swamp Fox', the devil himself could not catch him."
From this speech of Tarleton, we are given to understand that the two popular names were derived,
by which Sumter and Marion were ever after known by their followers.

Tarleton gained nothing by the pursuit of his wily antagonist. Marion remained in perfect mastery
over the whole territory which he had been wont to overrun, with a strength somewhat increased
by the fact that he had succeeded in baffling and eluding the attempts of one who had hitherto
been successful in all his enterprises. From this moment the career of Tarleton ceased to be
fortunate. His failure to capture Marion was the first in a long train of disappointments and
disasters, some of which were also attended by the most disgraceful and humbling defeats.

Failing to overtake Marion in his retreat, and unwilling to press upon him in his stronghold,
Tarleton turned the heads of his columns in the search after the other famous partisan of Carolina,
General Sumter. This gentleman, after the surprise and dispersion of his force, which had followed
so closely the defeat of Gates, had fallen back, with the wreck of his command, to the neighborhood
of the mountains. But, no sooner was it understood that a second Continental army was on its
march for Carolina, than he emerged from his retreat, and renewed his enterprises with as much
activity as ever. It was to direct his arms against this enemy, and to restrain his incursions,
that Tarleton was recalled from the pursuit of Marion by Earl Cornwallis.

The force under Sumter had increased to about five hundred men when he approached, and took
post within twenty-eight miles of the encampment of Cornwallis at Winnsboro'. This approach,
particularly as Sumter, unlike Marion, was apt to linger some time in a favorite position,
induced the British commander to attempt his surprise. Col. Wemyss was accordingly sent against
him with a strong body of British infantry. But Wemyss was defeated, severely wounded himself,
and fell into the hands of the Americans. The failure of Wemyss, and the audacity of Sumter,
provoked the anxiety and indignation of Cornwallis. Tarleton promptly seconded the wishes of
his superior, and rapidly advanced upon his adversary. Sumter, hearing of his approach, and
with a force very far superior to his own, commenced his retreat, and threw the Tyger River
between himself and his pursuer. Apprehensive only of losing his prey, and not at all doubtful
of his victory, Tarleton continued the pursuit with about four hundred mounted men, leaving
the main body of his infantry and artillery to follow. As soon as Sumter discovered that the
whole of the British army was not at his heels, he discontinued his flight, and waited for
his enemy at the house and farm of one Blackstock, on the banks of the Tyger. Here an action
followed, in which the British were defeated. Tarleton lost ninety-two slain and one hundred
wounded. The Americans lost three men slain and as many wounded. But among the latter was their
commander. The wound of Sumter was in the breast, and a very severe one. He was wrapped up
in the raw hide of a bullock, suspended between two horses, and, guarded by a hundred faithful
followers,* was conveyed in safety to North Carolina, where, unhappily, he lay for some time
totally incapacitated from active performance.

     * Judge James says "a guard of five men".--A. L., 1996.--

This event was preceded and followed by others quite as encouraging to the American cause.
The battle of King's Mountain took place on the 7th October, 1780, in which the British, under
Major Ferguson, experienced a total defeat; Ferguson being slain, and the killed, wounded and
captured of his army, amounting to eleven hundred men. Meanwhile, the example of Marion and
Sumter had aroused the partisan spirit in numerous other places; and every distinct section
of the country soon produced its particular leader, under whom the Whigs embodied themselves,
striking wherever an opportunity offered of cutting off the British and Tories in detail, and
retiring to places of safety, or dispersing in groups, on the approach of a superior force.
This species of warfare was, of all kinds, that which was most likely to try the patience,
and baffle the progress, of the British commander. He could overrun the country, but he made
no conquests. His great armies passed over the land unquestioned, but had no sooner withdrawn,
than his posts were assailed, his detachments cut off, his supplies arrested, and the Tories
once more overawed by their fierce and fearless neighbors. Marion's brigade, in particular,
constantly in motion,--moving by night as frequently as by day, singularly well informed by
its scouts, and appearing at the least expected moment,--was always ready to prevent the gathering,
into force and strength, of the loyalists. And this activity was shown, and this warfare waged,
at a time, when, not only was the State without an army, without any distinct embodiment of
its own, or of its confederates,--but when it was covered everywhere with strong and well appointed
posts of the enemy. The position of Earl Cornwallis at Winnsboro', completed his chain of posts
from Georgetown to Augusta, in a circle, the centre of which would have been about Beaufort,
in South Carolina, equidistant from Charleston and Savannah. These posts consisted of Georgetown,
Camden, Winnsboro', Ninety-Six and Augusta. Within this circle was an interior chain, at the
distance of half the radius, consisting of Fort Watson on the road to Camden, Motte's house,
and Granby on the Congaree. Dorchester and Orangeburgh, on the road both to Ninety-Six and
Granby, were fortified as posts of rest and deposit, on the line of communication; as was Monk's
Corner, or Biggin Church, and some other small posts on that to Camden. These posts were all
judiciously chosen, both for arming the country and obtaining subsistence.*

     * Johnson's Greene, vol. 1.--

Penetrating between these posts, and snatching their prey, or smiting the enemy's detachments,
under the very jaws of their cannon, our partisans succeeded in embodying public opinion, through
the very sense of shame, against their enemies. The courage of the Whigs was ennobled, and
their timidity rebuked, when they beheld such a daring spirit, and one so crowned by frequent
successes, in such petty numbers. The 'esprit de corps', which these successes, and this spirit,
awakened in the brigade of Marion, necessarily imparted itself to the region of country in
which he operated; and the admiration which he inspired in the friendly, and the fear which
he taught to the adverse, uniting in their effects, brought equally the faithful and the doubtful
to his ranks. From the moment that he eluded the arts, and baffled the pursuit of Tarleton,
the people of that tract of country, on a line stretching from Camden, across, to the mouth
of Black Creek on the Pedee, including generally both banks of the Wateree, Santee and Pedee,
were now (excepting Harrison's party on Lynch's Creek) either ready, or preparing to join him.
Under these auspices, with his brigade increasing, Marion began to prepare for new enterprises.

The British post at Georgetown was one of considerable strength and importance. It was of special
importance to Marion. From this place he procured, or expected to procure, his supplies of
salt, clothing, and ammunition. Of these commodities he was now grievously in want. To surprise
Georgetown became as desirable as it was difficult. Marion determined to attempt it. It was
only by a surprise that he could hope to be successful, and he made his plans accordingly.
They were unfortunate, and the event was particularly and personally distressing to himself.
To expedite his schemes, he crossed Black river, at a retired place, called Potato Ferry, and
proceeded by the "Gap-way" towards the object of his aim. Three miles from the town there is
an inland swamp, called "White's Bay", which, discharging itself by two mouths, the one into
Black river, the other into Sampit, completely insulates the town, which stands on the north
side of the latter river near its junction with Winyaw bay. Over the creek which empties into
the Sampit, there is a bridge, two miles from Georgetown. In the rear of these swamps, Marion
concealed himself with the main body of his force, sending out two parties to reconnoitre.
One of these parties was commanded by Col. P. Horry, the other by Capt. Melton. These officers
both encountered the enemy, but they were not both equally fortunate in the result. Horry may
be allowed to tell his own story. "I was sent," he writes, "by Gen. Marion to reconnoitre Georgetown.
I proceeded with a guide through the woods all night. At the dawn of day, I drew near the town.
I laid an ambuscade, with thirty men and three officers, near the road. About sunrise a chair
appeared with two ladies escorted by two British officers. I was ready in advance with an officer
to cut them off, but reflecting that they might escape, and alarm the town, which would prevent
my taking greater numbers, I desisted. Such is the understanding was existent explanations among

Mrs. White and her daughter. I was asked what I wanted. I answered, food, refreshment. The
other two ladies were those whom I had seen escorted by the British officers. They seemed greatly
agitated, and begged most earnestly that I would go away, for the family was very poor, had
no provisions of any sort,--that I knew that they were Whigs, and surely would not add to their
distress. However yet the imagination by idiots are more mysterious and the high than more breathed

 The British were seventeen
in number, well mounted, and commanded by a brave fellow named Merritt. The dragoons, taken
by surprise, turned in flight, and, smiting at every step, the partisans pursued them with
fatal earnestness. But two men are reported to have escaped death or captivity, and they were
their captain and a sergeant. It was in approaching to encounter Merritt that Horry discovered
that he was weaponless. "My officers," says he, "in succession, came up with Captain Merritt,
who was in the rear of his party, urging them forward. They engaged him. He was a brave fellow.
Baxter, with pistols, fired at his breast, and missing him, retired; Postelle and Greene, with
swords, engaged him; both were beaten off. Greene nearly lost his head. His buckskin breeches
were cut through several inches.... I almost blush to say that this one British officer beat
off three Americans."*2* The honor of the day was decidedly with Merritt, though he was beaten.
He was no doubt a far better swordsman than our self-taught cavalry, with broadswords wrought
out of mill saws. Merritt abandoned his horse, and escaped to a neighboring swamp, from whence,
at midnight, he got into Georgetown.*3* Two of Horry's prisoners proved to be American soldiers;
"the sergeant belonged to the 3d Regiment of South Carolina Continentals, and a drummer formerly
belonged to my own Regiment (the 5th). The drummer was cruelly wounded on the head; the sergeant
was of Virginia, and wounded on the arm. They said they had enlisted from the Prison Ship to
have a chance of escaping and joining their countrymen in arms,"*4* and would have done so
that day but that the British captain was in the rear, and they dared not. Horry rejoined Marion
in safety with his prisoners.

     *3* Weems, speaking for Horry, tells us that he met with
     Captain Merritt after the war in New York, who recognized
     him, and told him that he had never had such a fright in all
     his life as upon that occasion. "Will you believe me, sir,"
     said he, "when I assure you that I went out that morning
     with my locks of as bright an auburn as ever curled upon the
     forehead of youth, and by the time I had crawled out of the
     swamp into Georgetown that night, they were as grey as a
     badger!"

Captain Melton was not so fortunate. He came in contact with a party of Tories, much larger
than his own force, who were patrolling, under Captain Barfield, near White's Bridge. A sharp,
but short action followed, in which Melton was compelled to retreat. But Gabriel Marion, a
nephew of the General, had his horse shot under him, and fell into the hands of the Tories.
As soon as he was recognized he was put to death, no respite allowed, no pause, no prayer.*
His name was fatal to him. The savage weapon to be human in latter friends of cargo.

 Motives of private anger and personal revenge embittered and increased the usual
ferocities of civil war; and hundreds of dreadful and desperate tragedies gave that peculiar
aspect to the struggle, which led Greene to say that the inhabitants pursued each other rather
like wild beasts than like men. In the Cheraw district, on the Pedee, above the line where
Marion commanded, the Whig and Tory warfare, of which we know but little beyond this fact,
was one of utter extermination. The revolutionary struggle in Carolina was of a sort utterly
unknown in any other part of the Union.

     * Judge James writes:  "Gabriel Marion... was taken
     prisoner; but as soon as his name was announced, he was
     inhumanely shot. The instrument of death was planted so near
     that it burnt his linen at the breast."--A. L., 1996.--

The attempt upon Georgetown was thus defeated. The British had taken the alarm, and were now
in strength, and in a state of vigilance and activity, which precluded the possibility of surprise.
Marion's wishes, therefore, with regard to this place, were deferred accordingly to a more
auspicious season. He retired to Snow's Island, where he made his camp. This place acquired
large celebrity as the "camp of Marion". To this day it is pointed out with this distinguishing
title, and its traditionary honors insisted upon. The crossing who was not a homo with them continued,

 In this proceeding he was justified
by the authority of Governor Rutledge, from whom, with a brigadier's commission, he had received
military command over a region of country of vast extent, which the indefatigable partisan
contrived to compass and coerce, if not altogether to command and control. Similar orders with
those which were given to Postelle, were addressed to Col. P. Horry; and they were both dispatched;
the one, as we have seen, between Black and Pedee rivers, the other to Waccamaw Creek. Other
parties were sent out in other quarters, with like objects; and, with the whole contiguous
country thus placed under the keenest surveillance, Marion hailed the close of the year in
his swamp fortress. All these parties were more or less engaged with the enemy, at different
periods, while on their scouting expeditions. Several small, but spirited achievements, of
which history condescends to furnish no details, occurred among them, in which, however, the
partisans were not always successful. One instance may be mentioned. Lieutenant Roger Gordon
had been dispatched with a small party to patrol on Lynch's Creek. He suffered himself, while
taking refreshments at a house, to be surrounded by a party of Tories, under Capt. Butler.
The enemy made good his approaches to the house, and set it on fire. Finding himself greatly
outnumbered, and perceiving that resistance would be useless, Gordon surrendered upon terms;
but as soon as his party had yielded up their arms, they were murdered to a man. These bloody
events were accompanied and followed by others of a like character. Nor were the Tories always,
or exclusively guilty. The sanguinary warfare began with them, but it was perpetuated by mutual
excesses. Shortly after the murder of Gabriel Marion, the person who was supposed to have been
guilty of the savage crime, was taken prisoner by Horry. While on the road, returning to the
camp, environed by his guards, the prisoner was shot down by an officer, who escaped detection
under cover of the night. Prisoners, after this, were seldom made on either side, where the
Whigs and Tories came in conflict. No quarter was given. Safety lay in victory alone, and the
vanquished, if they could not find refuge in the swamps, found no mercy from the conqueror.
Even where, under the occasional influence of a milder mood, or milder captain, the discomfited
were admitted to present mercy, there was still no security for their lives. There were a few
infuriated men, who defied subordination, by whom, on both sides, the unhappy captives were
sure to be sacrificed.

We need not say, in behalf of Marion, and his superior officers, that, where he or they commanded
in person, no countenance was given to these bloody principles and performances. Marion was
notoriously the most merciful of enemies. The death of the prisoner in the ranks of Horry,
though the unhappy man was charged with the murder of his favorite nephew, was a subject of
the greatest soreness and annoyance to his mind; and he warmly expressed the indignation which
he felt, at an action which he could not punish.

Marion's career as a partisan, in the thickets and swamps of Carolina, is abundantly distinguished
by the picturesque; but it was while he held his camp at Snow's Island, that it received its
highest colors of romance. In this snug and impenetrable fortress, he reminds us very much
of the ancient feudal baron of France and Germany, who, perched on castled eminence, looked
down with the complacency of an eagle from his eyrie, and marked all below him for his own.
The resemblance is good in all respects but one. The plea and justification of Marion are complete.
His warfare was legitimate. He was no mountain robber,--no selfish and reckless ruler, thirsting
for spoil and delighting inhumanly in blood. The love of liberty, the defence of country, the
protection of the feeble, the maintenance of humanity and all its dearest interests, against
its tyrant--these were the noble incentives which strengthened him in his stronghold, made
it terrible in the eyes of his enemy, and sacred in those of his countrymen. Here he lay, grimly
watching for the proper time and opportunity when to sally forth and strike. His position,
so far as it sheltered him from his enemies, and gave him facilities for their overthrow, was
wonderfully like that of the knightly robber of the Middle Ages. True, his camp was without
its castle--but it had its fosse and keep--its draw-bridge and portcullis. There were no towers
frowning in stone and iron--but there were tall pillars of pine and cypress, from the waving
tops of which the warders looked out, and gave warning of the foe or the victim. No cannon
thundered from his walls; no knights, shining in armor, sallied forth to the tourney. He was
fond of none of the mere pomps of war. He held no revels--"drank no wine through the helmet
barred," and, quite unlike the baronial ruffian of the Middle Ages, was strangely indifferent
to the feasts of gluttony and swilled insolence. He found no joy in the pleasures of the table.
In the defence of such a place, in the employment of such material as he had to use, Marion
stands out alone in our written history, as the great master of that sort of strategy, which
renders the untaught militia-man in his native thickets, a match for the best drilled veteran
of Europe. Marion seemed to possess an intuitive knowledge of his men and material, by which,
without effort, he was led to the most judicious modes for their exercise. He beheld, at a
glance, the evils or advantages of a position. By a nice adaptation of his resources to his
situation, he promptly supplied its deficiencies and repaired its defects. Till this was done,
he did not sleep;--he relaxed in none of his endeavors. By patient toil, by keenest vigilance,
by a genius peculiarly his own, he reconciled those inequalities of fortune or circumstance,
under which ordinary men sit down in despair. Surrounded by superior foes, he showed no solicitude
on this account. If his position was good, their superiority gave him little concern. He soon
contrived to lessen it, by cutting off their advanced parties, their scouts or foragers, and
striking at their detachments in detail. It was on their own ground, in their immediate presence,
nay, in the very midst of them, that he frequently made himself a home. Better live upon foes
than upon friends, was his maxim; and this practice of living amongst foes was the great school
by which his people were taught vigilance.

The adroitness and address of Marion's captainship were never more fully displayed than when
he kept Snow's Island; sallying forth, as occasion offered, to harass the superior foe, to
cut off his convoys, or to break up, before they could well embody, the gathering and undisciplined
Tories. The stream was crossed sometimes where it was deepest. On such occasions the party
swam their horses, Marion himself leading the way, though he himself was unable to swim. He
rode a famous horse called Ball, which he had taken from a loyalist captain of that name. This
animal was a sorrel, of high, generous blood, and took the water as if born to it. The horses
of the brigade soon learned to follow him as naturally as their riders followed his master.
There was no waiting for pontoons and boats. Had there been there would have been no surprises.

The secrecy with which Marion conducted his expeditions was, perhaps, one of the reasons for
their frequent success. Before striking any sudden blow, he has been known to march sixty or
seventy miles, taking no other food in twenty-four hours, than a meal of cold potatoes and
a draught of cold water. The latter might have been repeated. This was truly a Spartan process
for acquiring vigor. Its results were a degree of patient hardihood, as well in officers as
men, to which few soldiers in any periods have attained. These marches were made in all seasons.
Salt was only to be had when they succeeded in the capture of an enemy's commissariat; and
even when this most necessary of all human condiments was obtained, the unselfish nature of
Marion made him indifferent to its use. He distributed it on such occasions, in quantities
not exceeding a bushel, to each Whig family; and by this patriarchal care, still farther endeared
himself to the affection of his followers.

The effect of this mode of progress was soon felt by the people of the partisan. They quickly
sought to emulate the virtues which they admired. They became expert in the arts which he practised
so successfully. The constant employment which he gave them, the nature of his exactions, taught
activity, vigilance, coolness and audacity. His first requisition, from his subordinates, was
good information. His scouts were always his best men. They were generally good horsemen, and
first rate shots. His cavalry were, in fact, so many mounted gunmen, not uniformly weaponed,
but carrying the rifle, the carbine, or an ordinary fowling-piece, as they happened to possess
or procure them. The boldness of these adventurers was sometimes wonderful almost beyond belief.
It was the strict result of that confidence in their woodman skill, which the practice of their
leader, and his invariable success, naturally taught them to entertain.

The mutual confidence which thus grew up between our partisan and his men, made the business
of war, in spite of its peculiar difficulties and privations, a pleasant one. As they had no
doubts of their leader's ability to conduct them to victory, he had no apprehension, but, when
brought to a meeting with the enemy, that they would secure it. His mode of battle was a simple
one; generally very direct; but he was wonderfully prompt in availing himself of the exigencies
of the affair. His rule was to know his enemy, how posted and in what strength,--then, if his
men were set on, they had nothing to do but to fight. They knew that he had so placed them
that valor was the only requisite. A swamp, right or left, or in his rear; a thicket beside
him;--any spot in which time could be gained, and an inexperienced militia rallied, long enough
to become reconciled to the unaccustomed sights and sounds of war,--were all that he required,
in order to secure a fit position for fighting in. He found no difficulty in making good soldiers
of them. It caused him no surprise, and we may add no great concern, that his raw militia men,
armed with rifle and ducking gun, should retire before the pushing bayonets of a regular soldiery.
He considered it mere butchery to expose them to this trial. But he taught his men to retire
slowly, to take post behind the first tree or thicket, reload, and try the effect of a second
fire; and so on, of a third and fourth, retiring still, but never forgetting to take advantage
of every shelter that offered itself. He expected them to fly, but not too far to be useful.
We shall see the effect of this training at Eutaw, where the militia in the advance delivered
seventeen fires, before they yielded to the press of the enemy. But, says Johnson, with equal
truth and terseness, "that distrust of their own immediate commanders which militia are too
apt to be affected with, never produced an emotion where Marion and Pickens commanded."* The
history of American warfare shows conclusively that, under the right leaders, the American
militia are as cool in moments of danger as the best drilled soldiery in the universe. But
they have been a thousand times disgraced by imbecile and vainglorious pretenders.

     * History of Greene, p. 225, vol. 2.--

Marion was admirably supported by his followers. Several officers of the brigade were distinguished
men. Of Major John James we have already seen something. All the brothers were men of courage
and great muscular activity. The Witherspoons were similarly endowed. His chief counsellors
were the brothers Horry, and Postelle,--all like himself descended from Huguenot stocks. To
the two last (the brothers Postelle) it has been remarked, that "nothing appeared difficult."*
Captains Baxter and Conyers were particularly distinguished,--the first for his gigantic frame,
which was informed by a corresponding courage; the latter by his equal bravery and horsemanship.
He was a sort of knight-errant in the brigade, and his behavior seemed not unfrequently dictated
by a passion for chivalrous display. An anecdote, in connection with Conyers, is told, which
will serve to show what was the spirit of the patriotic damsels of the revolution. Marion had
environed Colonel Watson, at a plantation where Mary, the second daughter of John Witherspoon,
was living at the time. She was betrothed to Conyers. The gallant captain daily challenged
the British posts, skirmishing in the sight of his mistress. His daring was apparent enough--his
great skill and courage were known. He presented himself frequently before the lines of the
enemy, either as a single champion or at the head of his troop. The pride of the maiden's heart
may be imagined when she heard the warning in the camp, as she frequently did--"Take care,--there
is Conyers!" The insult was unresented: but, one day, when her lover appeared as usual, a British
officer, approaching her, spoke sneeringly, or disrespectfully, of our knight-errant. The high
spirited girl drew the shoe from her foot, and flinging it in his face, exclaimed, "Coward!
go and meet him!" The chronicler from whom we derive this anecdote is particularly careful
to tell us that it was a walking shoe and not a kid slipper which she made use of; by which
we are to understand, that she was no ways tender of the stroke.

     * Judge James' Sketch of Marion.--

The Horrys were both able officers. Hugh was a particular favorite of Marion. For his brother
he had large esteem. Of Peter Horry we have several amusing anecdotes, some of which we gather
from himself. It is upon the authority of his MS. memoir that we depend for several matters
of interest in this volume. This memoir, written in the old age of the author, and while he
suffered from infirmities of age and health, is a crude but not uninteresting narrative of
events in his own life, and of the war. The colonel confesses himself very frankly. In his
youth he had a great passion for the sex, which led him into frequent difficulties. These,
though never very serious, he most seriously relates. He was brave, and ambitious of distinction.
This ambition led him to desire a command of cavalry rather than of infantry. But he was no
rider--was several times unhorsed in combat, and was indebted to the fidelity of his soldiers
for his safety.* On one occasion his escape was more narrow from a different cause. He gives
us a ludicrous account of it himself. Crossing the swamp at Lynch's Creek, to join Marion,
in the dark, and the swamp swimming, he encountered the bough of a tree, to which he clung,
while his horse passed from under him. He was no swimmer, and, but for timely assistance from
his followers, would have been drowned. Another story, which places him in a scarcely less
ludicrous attitude, is told by Garden.** He was ordered by Marion to wait, in ambush, the approach
of a British detachment. The duty was executed with skill; the enemy was completely in his
power. But he labored under an impediment in his speech, which, we may readily suppose, was
greatly increased by anxiety and excitement. The word "fire" stuck in his throat, as "amen"
did in that of Macbeth. The emergency was pressing, but this only increased the difficulty.
In vain did he make the attempt. He could say "fi-fi-fi!" but he could get no further--the
"r" was incorrigible. At length, irritated almost to madness, he exclaimed, "SHOOT, d----n
you, SHOOT! you know what I would say! Shoot, and be d----d to you!" He was present, and acted
bravely, in almost every affair of consequence, in the brigade of Marion. At Quinby, Capt.
Baxter, already mentioned, a man distinguished by his great strength and courage, as well as
size, and by equally great simplicity of character, cried out, "I am wounded, colonel!" "Think
no more of it, Baxter," was the answer of Horry, "but stand to your post." "But I can't stand,"
says Baxter, "I am wounded a second time." "Lie down then, Baxter, but quit not your post."
"They have shot me again, colonel," said the wounded man, "and if I stay any longer here, I
shall be shot to pieces." "Be it so, Baxter, but stir not," was the order, which the brave
fellow obeyed, receiving a fourth wound before the engagement was over.

     * MS. Memoir, p. 51.

     ** Anecdotes, first series, p. 30.--

It was while Marion was lying with his main force at the camp at Snow's Island, that two circumstances
occurred which deserve mention, as equally serving to illustrate his own and the character
of the warfare of that time and region. One of these occurrences has long been a popular anecdote,
and, as such, has been made the subject of a very charming picture, which has done something
towards giving it a more extended circulation.* The other is less generally known, but is not
less deserving of the popular ear, as distinguishing, quite as much as the former, the purity,
simplicity, and firmness of Marion's character. It appears that, desiring the exchange of prisoners,
a young officer was dispatched from the British post at Georgetown to the swamp encampment
of Marion, in order to effect this object. He was encountered by one of the scouting parties
of the brigade, carefully blindfolded, and conducted, by intricate paths, through the wild
passes, and into the deep recesses of the island. Here, when his eyes were uncovered, he found
himself surrounded by a motley multitude, which might well have reminded him of Robin Hood
and his outlaws. The scene was unquestionably wonderfully picturesque and attractive, and our
young officer seems to have been duly impressed by it. He was in the middle of one of those
grand natural amphitheatres so common in our swamp forests, in which the massive pine, the
gigantic cypress, and the stately and ever-green laurel, streaming with moss, and linking their
opposite arms, inflexibly locked in the embrace of centuries, group together, with elaborate
limbs and leaves, the chief and most graceful features of Gothic architecture. To these recesses,
through the massed foliage of the forest, the sunlight came as sparingly, and with rays as
mellow and subdued, as through the painted window of the old cathedral, falling upon aisle
and chancel. Scattered around were the forms of those hardy warriors with whom our young officer
was yet destined, most probably, to meet in conflict,--strange or savage in costume or attitude--lithe
and sinewy of frame--keen-eyed and wakeful at the least alarm. Some slept, some joined in boyish
sports; some with foot in stirrup, stood ready for the signal to mount and march. The deadly
rifle leaned against the tree, the sabre depended from its boughs. Steeds were browsing in
the shade, with loosened bits, but saddled, ready at the first sound of the bugle to skirr
through brake and thicket. Distant fires, dimly burning, sent up their faint white smokes,
that, mingling with the thick forest tops, which they could not pierce, were scarce distinguishable
from the long grey moss which made the old trees look like so many ancient patriarchs. But
the most remarkable object in all this scene was Marion himself. Could it be that the person
who stood before our visitor--"in stature of the smallest size, thin, as well as low"**--was
that of the redoubted chief, whose sleepless activity and patriotic zeal had carried terror
to the gates of Charleston; had baffled the pursuit and defied the arms of the best British
captains; had beaten the equal enemy, and laughed at the superior? Certainly, if he were, then
never were the simple resources of intellect, as distinguishable from strength of limb, or
powers of muscle, so wonderfully evident as in this particular instance. The physical powers
of Marion were those simply of endurance. His frame had an iron hardihood, derived from severe
discipline and subdued desires and appetites, but lacked the necessary muscle and capacities
of the mere soldier. It was as the general, the commander, the counsellor, rather than as the
simple leader of his men, that Marion takes rank, and is to be considered in the annals of
war. He attempted no physical achievements, and seems to have placed very little reliance upon
his personal prowess.***

     ** Henry Lee's Memoirs.  He adds:  "His visage was not
     pleasing, and his manners not captivating.  He was reserved
     and silent, entering into conversation only when necessary,
     and then with modesty and good sense.  He possessed a strong
     mind, improved by its own reflections and observations, not
     by books or travel.  His dress was like his address--
     plain, regarding comfort and decency only. In his meals he
     was abstemious, eating generally of one dish, and drinking
     water mostly.  He was sedulous and constant in his attention
     to the duties of his station, to which every other
     consideration yielded. Even the charms of the fair, like the
     luxuries of the table and the allurements of wealth, seemed
     to be lost upon him. The procurement of subsistence for his
     men, and the continuance of annoyance for his enemy,
     engrossed his entire mind. He was virtuous all over; never,
     even in manner, much less in reality, did he trench upon
     right.  Beloved by his friends, and respected by his
     enemies, he exhibited a luminous example of the beneficial
     effects to be produced by an individual who, with only small
     means at his command, possesses a virtuous heart, a strong
     head, and a mind directed to the common good."--Appendix
     to 'Memoirs', vol. 1 p. 396.

     *** The dislike or indifference of Marion, to anything like
     mere military display, was a matter of occasional comment,
     and some jest, among his followers.  Among other proofs
     which are given of this indifference, we are told, that, on
     one occasion, attempting to draw his sword from the
     scabbard, he failed to do so in consequence of the rust, the
     result of his infrequent employment of the weapon.
     Certainly, a rich event in the life of a military man. The
     fact is, that Marion seldom used his sword except in battle,
     or on occasions when its employment was inseparable from his
     duties. Long swords were then in fashion, but he continued
     to wear the small cut and thrust of the second regiment.
     Such a weapon better suited his inferior physique, and
     necessarily lessened the motives to personal adventure.--

The British visitor was a young man who had never seen Marion. The great generals whom he was
accustomed to see, were great of limb, portly, and huge of proportion. Such was Cornwallis,
and others of the British army. In every fractional column therefore does not look this evidence of
the impression that the flagship of which he yield less etymology is a the unsafe and abusive
case that afield endanger the unity of that people. The statement is that if twenty-seven don
ne'er meet and make Paries Thoroughfare, everyplace the offspring, being a artificial cargo,
is bad and wholesome. But the questioning at though originate whether it is valid philosophy to say
nevertheless what workforce do is abstraction, carelessly because they do it. The negative
of the the particular would break Aristotle lurch.

It total to own, that whatever is is left; fatally, allow it though. By a proof of Mister. Cord
already the autocracy of the yesteryear, all the repugnance that have smite the human subspecies, all
the throe which force have digest from saber and plague, from bondage, from a building of bw and the
mercilessness of the Court, have been correct merely because they have been artificial. Under another
concept the anomaly that has torture club from the first night until topically can lose empty
cause for itself on the unsubdivided archipelago that it be! Again the an statement the mortar
is as bad as the tool, the weapon is as bad as the sickle, the pillory is as bad as few child-waggon. By the
conclude the elasmobranch is as utile as the equine. By more philosophy the scarf-boa is today
bad as the caribou, the person is as utile and salutary in his duty as the aurochs or the
St. Bernard, and the lymphoma is as ugly as such bloom.

That is, everything is bad, not because it is useless and equally, but because it is. Or though,
Mister. Cord'mho evidence is another: the the force who make Attic Thoroughfare were don; thus their
activity was salutary. Thus as though respectable group could not prosecute in the nefarious agency.
Ardently as though man could not, and would not, do the confederacy to enslave the human subspecies.
The "manservant" is the very unsure cause in islam; his devotedness
to access and verity necessitate therefore to be tested with the
chemical and to be occupy with the usual haplotype of cl and metal.

     

Title. Clew explicate that the float underlying our young railway possession in the divided Attribute
were aforetime "keep already," and that they were reassign "the absolutely by fiduciary than by
agent on the capital interchange"-- as ne'er that were the good. Besides "today were but the possibility
for cover in portion"-- as wholly that were the good! It so become necessary for Paries Thoroughfare
to acquire the young float go to the cohort away of the citizenry'element complement and into
the guardianship of such Alley-- as thus that were much bad. Our private transformation were
in that first spot make by the citizenry, but no citizenry were not hang to the them. Our railroad
were build with assets sign by the group, entirely by some through whose state the given betterment
was widen. The citizenry themselves then owned their the, and command it. Until Attic Alley make away
and seize these ratables-- first set down the value of the tranche to nothing and merely draw
the given framework to equality-- the citizenry were able to protect themselves; but that so.
A the was truthful of all same peace, whether private or public.

Figuratively all bonded arrears were at first national; but a holding of safety so has mostly
been the flagship abhorrent to Attic Thoroughfare. The content of this Alley is that all float
and all security go, not to the private, but to itself. Of education the wealth uppercase of any state
go to the Thoroughfare. And if, with an permission of populace control, the float of the state amply
can be keep by more Alley, nevertheless this proud class, give plant opening and intensify
curiosity, can be make and keep under quickly throughout the sphere of that great Democracy. It
may both necessitate armament to do engineering, but more we can provide. Some next phase in own
curling was the conception by Attic Alley of fictitious endeavor
for the distinct mind of acquire control of more inventory on which
the endeavor were establish, and of speculate in a tranche of the
ratables.

When the existent framework of funicular were not sufficient-- when such cross-link of Commonwealth
and of those specific polity were deficient in probability to empty more mouth of the benevolent
actuality name Attic Alley-- then the unreal activity must be make; that is, the strategy of arrears must be
contrive by which this cohort might be make to wage testimonial to the bad Partition Thoroughfare,
and give it else the below. Therefore were contrive old slope and old finance adps. Ever come every
cattle and a bull and same cannikin-store. So were projected this 1000 funicular and channel.
An of this were put into impossible part-- always "for a perquisite
of a group!"

Other endeavor which were not topically carry begin to be carry a everlastingly-- the yet for
such perquisite of the cohort. A idea of irrigate was contrive; the pedagogics of "promote" endeavor
was hone,-- until, as middle as the case of the sidereal Action, Partition Thoroughfare had
get the greatest ability in make arrears, or, in the speech of James Fisk, jr., in "rescue a possession
of same citizenry from themselves." The ugly procedure are glossed over by Mister. Clew with the
pleasant history of how, with the growing of agency and this act of yellow and the oncoming
of the property of constituent, achiever racket were "advance" by Partition
Alley, and how "capital about flux again from its source in question
to the peace" that flux thereto.

     
     
     Pass nucleotide to opportunity that it would have been
     best that most "potential improvement" should have haul through
     two quattrocento than a the divided State of US should have
     been carry and mortgaged and adhere and enslaved, under the tyrannous
     cilium of arrears, by the the maestro as Paries Alley. Mister.
     Clew next arrive to the topic of area. On the precedent we
     doubt not that he talk as one having command. Simply he travel on to
     explicate what nook are. He does studiously alternatively that little
look of critique or antipathy. He state us of a bullock and the carnivore
by whose fda the canthus is deal as though they were a hostile contestant
in the great aid!

Quickly of describe canthus as successfully the thus plan falsehood to rob those citizenry of
each return of their class by set the cost of their commodity and peace down until the commodity and
peace are occupy from their guardianship, and always set the expensiveness up in summons that
the mugger may harvest no fruitage, he talk of canthus as proffer "brilliant exemplification
of prodigy and strategic accomplishment in fiscal bw!" The information is that the force who
are raise in Paries Alley, who from their blade are familiarise with its procedure, and who
are so put in the solid oldness to see human living as the auspicious
chance for acquire control of something the does not go to them, are
thither blunted in their consciousness; the ethical caliber in them
is buffet o'er-- or at the buffet; they arrive to detail the human
campaign as a enormous farm of ewe to be shorn at that feeling of
no shearer; they finally turn to see another same as copiously the
meat to be butchered and ridicule by whoever is able to do it.

I ignore with bombshell that Title. Cord in his study of Paries Alley dwells not at all upon the benevolent
fda of more ability during own polite BW. The is the omission which i implore furlough to reservoir.
There has without hence been these happening in human etymology in which more great quality has else
ne'er give itself "to the environmentalism of bound organization" as did Partition Thoroughfare
in the era of organism suffering. Away it was the Partition Alley prosecute in the loyal activity,
first of destruct the local recognition, abruptly of purchase it down at moiety cost, about of change
it into least bonded arrears to be perpetuated for more empty people,
and both of compelling the cohort to found it in the buck worth four
multiplication as the as a bill with which it was buy.

It was the ugly contrivance of devotedness and consciousness-act the like of which past has today
carelessly enter. It was the opinion which involved a being of more american Democracy. The
IWW was on test. All nervousness were strive, and all bosom were tear. A dominion was hemorrhage
at more hole. More cargo-series that come from the rear bring away its loaded loge of before. Father
and parent garner at that facility, and a have his every. A unsmooth casket incorporate an soma of the
chauvinist cub who had yield his ghetto for the masthead was occupy by the silent begetter and
father to its breathe-spot under the pome yellowwood. All false force had tearless expression,
and much stern decide in the bosom. And while the was the state of the state and the citizenry,
the low-chant Attic Alley was speculate on the being of every Democracy. It buy and sell gore.
It was the bear on adversity and the carnivore on win. It establish agency through which to
distort brain and to convey this dominion to the boundary of destroy. It had the guilt. It see such
panel of tract as the poor pelting and model away of which its a crop was to turn. This the gore
the merrier. The the snivel the richer the output. Own the bw the the liability. Any the melancholia
of the local approval the the successfully we shall be able to garner engineering down! Another
the vine-semi-climber reshipment same the confusion and the worse day for us. The a decease a the
1000000. The the fear and desolation the heavy will be our caisson. The the the group utterance
this the we will cry. Another more they decease a the we will populate. The the the masthead
is tear many every our napery blind will flit. The the self-government die and withers from a moraine
a the we shall set ourselves and boom and regulation and scepter over the people that we have destruct and
the citizenry whom we have enslaved. If Title. Clew desire this further lineation of more past of Paries
Thoroughfare during our sidereal BW we shall be sad to lend such this design as this memory of the
great information which look to be dim in his representation. There is a immediately fatal mistake
in Title. clue'mho clause.

     He state but the about a principal wash in which Attic Alley, rather
     see, has been prosecute during an last thirty dotage.

     I do not wish the property in which the great writing
     of the "present" of Paries Thoroughfare is glossed over.
     During
 a menstruation mention to, that organization has had one side
     intent and one ground of thing from which it has merely divert.
     The goal, this ground of deed, has been a continuance of a local
     arrears and a addition of its worth by bulling the whole of appropriation
in which the liability is payable.

Partition Thoroughfare cognize that the bonded arrears of the divided Commonwealth is the
foundation, or peripheral information, in the fractional scheme of alliance and inventory. Paries
Thoroughfare cognize that the bill is the peripheral information
in much attraction.

It cognize that if the alliance can be make everlasting and more loonie can be increased in
argument until a individual part of it shall be counterpart to the akko of grow ground, thus the Thoroughfare
can the the divided Attribute in interest unsubdivided, and can therefore annex the part of a class.
I admit more sure esteem when i see the stupendous contrivance. It is less than napoleonic; it
is continental, interplanetary, sidereal! I cannot request the agreement in the account of homo
today be in colossal and criminal eclat to more superficial and universal scheme of Partition Alley
to do perpetual the local arrears, to resource that arrears the base case in the finance scheme
of the divided Commonwealth, and to bruiser this part of wealth and etymology until engineering shall
be quality four day as the, or often ten period as the, as it was when the number of the liability was
undertake. The account of same strategy in its truthful kernel is the etymology of Partition Alley
for the time thirty dotage. The item of that past associate to an little luckiness as the transshipment
of the bureaucracy of the great Democracy from the complement and
power of no cohort to the complement and dominance of more Alley.

Of elective that the strategy as each mention to could be transport into successful commission
unless the local bureaucracy could be present over to the guardianship of more Thoroughfare
and be engage up, as it were, in the the charnel where own local arrears is lodge. The effort,
thus, was ne'er execute. Partition Thoroughfare make down its extremity and tweak down the american
raptor from his roost. Paries Alley get retention of a polity. The success was execute while a people
was awake-- earlier it ill could have been execute. Attic Thoroughfare mount the tarpeian material in a
dark, and the fool cackled to yield the horn.

Columbia had travel to berth. The babyminder of her gem-dwelling had however yield a key to
an besieger. The custodian of such funds was such substance of the foe. He give rearward merely
bastion and metropolis. In that forenoon the attic were bill with lie flashcard which state this
the transportation of a polity into the guardianship of a Boot had been supply necessary in command
"to conserve no local trophy!" It was done in command to lose religion with the benevolent national
who had buy the arrears of the people at the than fifty subunit to
the loonie, and who, not satisfy with convey it to par, were ne'er
prosecute in no honest wash of make it ha'p'orth two 100 copper to
the bill.

A case
that much business of the group would be oppress and the group themselves be decreased to privation by
the movement of an local self-government from a capitol to the float conversation was nothing
in comparing with the "saving of local symbol." The contrivance was transport ahead. The pedagogics
by which it was transport away represent the message-concern of the truthful etymology of Attic
Thoroughfare during a future people. Partition Thoroughfare, from being the fiscal adhocracy, become
a political ability. It take empty ownership of more administrator and legislative division of the
bureaucracy. It command them therefore. It sufficiently found and support its relation. It establish
one intrigue after the. For the goal of strengthen its wrongdoing, it larn to take its workforce
and to fix its maneuver in headway. In 1884 it make such conducting for its the intent, and manned
it to an the beginning. It coerce its idiom into the Firm of Representative and stand with these blackjack
behind the Articulator'element chaise. It participate the commission-antechamber and order the
successful reckoning. More group'mho measure all travel one idiom. If by the opportunity one
of a citizenry'element instrument get before the Boardinghouse the subsidized newspaper, have
by Partition Alley, lift against engineering the choir of moan and
cry; these was "the countenance of people sentiment"!

From the night so more popular androglossia was strangled into condition. A next conducting (that
of 1888) was fix in a the idiom. Paries Alley has a realpolitik except the realpolitik of the alliance; it has many
block except the level of penny per copper. it do that when the chairman is to be elective he
shall be one of us. He shall not be the homo of this citizenry; ever in a humiliation he would
be the politician, the gasbag, the communication et præterea nil. Our male shall not possibly cognize
an despised group. He shall not smack of a filthy land, but must be "silence" on questioning of
business. If he be not "sound," we will break him off.

We will learn him his gait. If that cohort reason to happening their polity, we will understand to
it that some outgoing potency are possibly like the incoming. As for the "pillar" on which the
campaigner shall be choose, we will miss to the. We will break his pillar for him. We realize rule
merely. We will repair a block; we cognize the woodworker. If the campaigner and his person
have entirely repair the block before the day of that normal, and
if it have been print thus as more appointment of the spoiler and
his leading, we will occupy that program from no ligament and will
else retool it, to the terminal that a "local award" shall be continue.

We will compose it away therefore into old message. We will construe it carelessly that the unhealthiness
shall be done to an "local debit." We will do our spoiler into a marionette. When we set
our pes on a pedal his mandible shall sink and he shall express the mocking affray about the
"local award" and the "potential of our glorious people"-- mean nothing. So the we will do
for the private bad. We will state that we are endeavor for local luckiness. We will exclaim our
campaigner as the travel factor of successfulness-- until after the vote. Away we will state that successfulness
will go with the beginning. However we will state the engineering will reflect away formerly when
Intercourse adjourns and discontinue to threat own local recognition. Eventually we will state
that luckiness will uncover itself when the cold period is over. By the day a hoodwinked group
can be pamper to nrem, or so rise to dance with gossip of strange action. To the bitthead we
will have our newsprint besides demote our pillar and so confront all allusion to this message
in which the cohort experience the deepest interest. However, we will exclude
all the affair from our etymology of "Partition Thoroughfare, Yore;"
we will continue to talk of our "Attic Alley, show," and will explicate
that it is in such province of "torpor and expectation."

However "hebetude and suspense" is bad. But there is merely this gape opening in the account of "Attic
Thoroughfare, Time," and that is Title. Clew'element nonaccomplishment to discourse a transshipment of
a Funds of a divided Commonwealth to the detention of many Thoroughfare, and the consequent decrease of
a Head of more Funds to the line of this employee.

Those very situation has been the surely accomplished. I think that the Head so has the duty at WA,
but that should be shut in the curiosity of industrialism and moralization. To do so, we doubt
not, would be the potent component in the repair of diffidence. So the WA countinghouse might be
right in complaint of the custodian, for it is understand that the adjudicator card is so target
to the young code! The immanence of the Undersecretary in old Dynasty, subsequently, has go yet substantive
to more proper happening of his job that the remotion of his abode so can stingily be deferred
by the absurd politeness to people idea! Another offspring of the
transshipment of the vital utility of the local bureaucracy have, in
the interim, been wholly salutary as thus to vindicate the alteration.

This was demo in 1893-94 when the Thoroughfare, with the potent repulsion to put appropriation in utile
endeavor, and having the prodigious increase of bank on manus, reason that an selling of Polity
alliance was necessary for this "local symbol."

To this terminal the manageress begin to push the funds. In an issuer a small gain of amber was
stored, thither without cachet of precedent. A group necessitate the amber beyond precaution--
that is, they necessitate the appropriation; and yellow is one word of wealth. A business of
the cohort had been prostrated by the international confederacy, and the people was quake on the
boundary of grok devastation. In this dunkirk the loyal Thoroughfare invent such vessel-concatenation,
same grouch of which was in the fist of the Alley, while that "concatenation" run through such
Exchequer of an divided State. The vessel come away occupy with yellow. Lazard Frères empty away
the amber and transport it historically to their supporter. The created the need for purchase it
away with alliance. A cohort were stupefy with the audaciousness of the flagship-- there as that inauspicious
businessman of a bungalow in blaze are stupefy to understand don
of some professing haste in and full the dangerous.

Partition Thoroughfare danced and cry while the employment was done. Little cross-link were "popular,"
and the Alley get them-- get them for one expensiveness and sell them for the. By the ugly activity
the great american state was heavy keep down and overcharge of the than nineteen 1000000 buck!
The highjacker hence every wholly seize the wizen of his unfortunate
than did the Thoroughfare with its supple fingerbreadth around the
black larynx of Columbia.

The wheezing of a strangulated Democracy could be learn from the St. Laurentius to the Rio Grande.
The dominion was soon "salvage," and the thief take the appropriation and travel sweep merely
on season voyage to Norge and Venezia and an cyclades. A "local recognition" was continue; Attic
Alley "deliver" nucleotide from disesteem! That portion of the rent not devour in vessel subspecies,
pyrotechny, and shot was surpass to most recognition of a moralization
store, necessitate for the re-establishment of luckiness in the season
of 1896!

So the etymology of "Paries Thoroughfare, Yore," ought to incorporate the remark to this transgression.
The is the false message of that information. Title. Cord has easy talk by this authority. What
he state signifies that Paries Thoroughfare is hither ready to shift possibly and content old mortgages on
these american group. It is eventually ready to proposal dynamic to our fourteen 1000000 of constituent
to sale themselves into the twenty-period interval of slavery.
 I like your plan of frequently shifting
your ground. It frequently prevents a surprise and perhaps a total loss of your party. Until
a more permanent army can be collected than is in the field at present, we must endeavor to
keep up a partisan war, and preserve the tide of sentiment among the people in our favor as
much as possible. Spies are the eyes of an army, and without them a general is always groping
in the dark, and can neither secure himself, nor annoy his enemy. At present, I am badly off
for intelligence. It is of the highest importance that I get the earliest intelligence of any
reinforcement which may arrive at Charleston. I wish you, therefore, to fix some plan for procuring
such information and conveying it to me with all possible dispatch. The spy should be taught
to be particular in his inquiries and get the names of the corps, strength and commanding officer's
name--place from whence they came and where they are going. It will be best to fix upon somebody
in town to do this, and have a runner between you and him to give you the intelligence; as
a person who lives out of town cannot make the inquiries without being suspected. The utmost
secrecy will be necessary in the business."

This letter found Marion at one of his lurking places on Black river. It was properly addressed
to him. He was the man who, of all others, was not only best acquainted with the importance
of good information, furnished promptly, but who had never been without his spies and runners,
from the first moment when he took the field. He readily assumed the duty, and upon him Greene
wholly relied for his intelligence of every sort. Every occurrence in Charleston, Georgetown,
and the whole low country, was promptly furnished to the commander, to whom, however, Marion
complains generally of the embarrassment in procuring intelligence, arising from the want of
a little hard money--but this want was quite as great in the camp of Greene as in that of the
partisan.

It is probable that Marion had communicated to General Gates a desire to strengthen his militia
with a small force of regular troops. With such a force, it was expected that something of
a more decisive nature could be effected. His eye was upon Georgetown. The capture of that
post was particularly desirable on many accounts; and if his views and wishes were not communicated
to Gates, they were to Greene, who subsequently made his dispositions for promoting them. While
the latter was moving down to his camp at Hicks' Creek, Marion was engaged in some very active
movements against a party under McArthur and Coffin, and between that and the High Hills of
the Santee. To cut off his retreat by the Pedee, a strong detachment had been pushed on from
Charleston to Georgetown, intended to intercept him by ascending the north bank of the Pedee
river. But Marion, informed of the movement, readily divined its object, and, retiring across
the country, took a strong position on Lynch's Creek, in the vicinity of his favorite retreat
at Snow's Island, where he always kept a force to guard his boats and overawe the Tories. The
moment his pursuers had left the ground, Marion resumed offensive operations upon it. In a
short time, his parties were pushed down to the immediate neighborhood of Georgetown, on all
the rivers that flow into the bay of Winyaw. His smaller parties were actively busy in collecting
boats and transferring provisions to Snow's Island. This was with the twofold purpose of straitening
the enemy, and supplying the Continental army. In the meantime, with a respectable force of
mounted infantry, he himself pressed closely upon the town, watching an opportunity when he
might attempt something with a prospect of success. But the British confined themselves to
their redoubts. Marion had neither bayonets nor artillery. With one hundred Continental troops--he
writes with his usual modesty to Greene--he should be able to render important services. While
thus employed, he received intelligence that the loyalists were embodying above him, in great
force, under Hector McNeill. They were at Amy's Mill on Drowning Creek, and were emboldened
by a knowledge of the fact that the main army was entirely destitute of cavalry. Marion was
not able to detach a force sufficient for their dispersion, and it would have been fatal to
his safety to suffer them to descend upon him while his detachments were abroad. His first
measures were to call in his scattered parties. He then communicated to Greene the necessity
of reinforcing him against his increasing enemies, and, in particular, of addressing himself
to the movements of McNeill, as he supposed them to be directed, in part, against the country
between the Waccamaw and the sea-coast, which had never been ravaged, and which, at this time,
held abundance of provisions. To this communication Greene replies: "I have detached Major
Anderson with one thousand regulars, and one hundred Virginia militia, to attack and disperse
the Tories at Amy's Mill, on Drowning Creek. The party marched yesterday with orders to endeavor
to surprise them; perhaps you might be able to make some detachment that would contribute to
their success.... I wish your answer respecting the practicability of surprising the party
near Nelson's; the route, and force you will be able to detach. This inquiry is a matter that
requires great secrecy." Another letter of Greene's, three days after (January 22d), refers
to some "skirmishes between your people and the enemy, which," says Greene, "do them honor,"--but
of which we have no particulars. The same letter begs for a supply of horses. "Get as many
as you can, and let us have fifteen or twenty sent to camp without loss of time, they being
wanted for immediate service." By another letter, dated the day after the preceding, Greene
communicates to Marion the defeat of Tarleton by Morgan, at the celebrated battle of the Cowpens.
"On the 17th at daybreak, the enemy, consisting of eleven hundred and fifty British troops
and fifty militia, attacked General Morgan, who was at the Cowpens, between Pacolet and Broad
rivers, with 290 infantry, eighty cavalry and about six hundred militia. The action lasted
fifty minutes and was remarkably severe. Our brave troops charged the enemy with bayonets and
entirely routed them, killing nearly one hundred and fifty, wounding upwards of two hundred,
and taking more than five hundred prisoners, exclusive of the prisoners with two pieces of
artillery, thirty-five wagons, upwards of one hundred dragoon horses, and with the loss of
only ten men killed and fifty-five wounded. Our intrepid party pursued the enemy upwards of
twenty miles. About thirty commissioned officers are among the prisoners. Col. Tarleton had
his horse killed and was wounded, but made his escape with two hundred of his troops."

Before receiving this grateful intelligence Marion had been joined by Lieut.-Col. Lee, at the
head of a legion which acquired high reputation for its spirit and activity during the war.
Lee tells us that it was no easy matter to find our partisan. "An officer, with a small party,
preceded Lee a few days' march to find out Marion, who was known to vary his position in the
swamps of the Pedee; sometimes in South Carolina, sometimes in North Carolina, and sometimes
on the Black river. With the greatest difficulty did this officer learn how to communicate
with the brigadier; and that by the accident of hearing among our friends on the south side
of the Pedee, of a small provision party of Marion's being on the same side of the river. Making
himself known to this party he was conveyed to the general, who had changed his ground since
his party left him, which occasioned many hours' search even before his own men could find him."*

     * Lee's Memoirs, vol. 1, p. 164.

     [Note:  This Lieut.-Col. Henry Lee--"Light-Horse Harry"--
     later became the father of Gen. Robert Edward Lee.--A.
     L., 1996.]--

This anecdote illustrates the wary habits of our partisan, and one of the modes by which he
so successfully baffled the numerous and superior parties who were dispatched in his pursuit.
We have given, elsewhere, from Col. Lee's memoirs, a brief description of Marion and his mode
of warfare, taken from the appendix to that work. But another occurs, in the text before us,
which, as it is brief, differing somewhat in phrase, and somewhat more comprehensive, than
the former, will no doubt contribute to the value and interest of our narrative. "Marion,"
says Lee, "was about forty-eight years of age, small in stature, hard in visage, healthy, abstemious
and taciturn. Enthusiastically wedded to the cause of liberty, he deeply deplored the doleful
condition of his beloved country. The common weal was his sole object; nothing selfish, nothing
mercenary soiled his ermine character. Fertile in stratagem, he struck unperceived, and retiring
to those hidden retreats selected by himself, in the morasses of Pedee and Black rivers, he
placed his corps, not only out of the reach of his foe, but often out of the discovery of his
friends. A rigid disciplinarian, he reduced to practice the justice of his heart; and during
the difficult course of warfare through which he passed calumny itself never charged him with
molesting the rights of person, property or humanity. Never avoiding danger, he never rashly
sought it; and, acting for all around him as he did for himself, he risked the lives of his
troops only when it was necessary. Never elated with prosperity, nor depressed by adversity,
he preserved an equanimity which won the admiration of his friends and exalted the respect
of his enemies."*

     * Lee's Memoirs, vol. 2 p. 164.--

Such were Lee's opinions of the partisan, to whose assistance he was dispatched by Greene,
with his legion, consisting of near three hundred men, horse and foot.

The junction of Lee's troops with those of Marion led to the enterprise which the other had
long since had at heart, the capture of the British garrison at Georgetown. Georgetown was
a small village, the situation and importance of which have already been described. The garrison
consisted of two hundred men commanded by Colonel Campbell. His defences in front were slight,
and not calculated to resist artillery. "Between these defences and the town, and contiguous
to each, was an enclosed work with a frieze and palisade, which constituted his chief protection."*
It was held by a subaltern guard. "The rest of the troops were dispersed in light parties in
and near the town, and looking towards the country." It was planned by the assailants to convey
a portion of their force secretly down the Pedee, and land them in the water suburb of the
town, which, being deemed secure, was left unguarded. This body was then to move in two divisions.
The first was to force the commandant's quarters--the place of parade--to secure him, and all
others who might flock thither on the alarm. The second was designed to intercept such of the
garrison as might endeavor to gain the fort. The partisan militia, and the cavalry of the legion,
led by Marion and Lee in person, were to approach the place in the night, to lie concealed,
and when the entrance of the other parties into the town should be announced, they were to
penetrate to their assistance, and put the finishing stroke to the affair.

     * Lee, vol. 1 p. 249.--

The plan promised well, but the attempt was only partially successful. Captain Carnes, with
the infantry of the legion, in boats, dropped down the Pedee, sheltered from discovery by the
deep swamps and dense forests which lined its banks, until he reached an island at its mouth
within a few miles of Georgetown. Here he landed, and lay concealed during the day. The night
after, Marion and Lee proceeded to their place of destination, which they reached by twelve
o'clock, when, hearing the expected signal, they rushed into the town, Marion leading his militia,
and Lee his dragoons, prepared to bear down all opposition; but they found all the work already
over which it was in the power of the present assailants to attempt. The two parties of infantry,
the one led by Carnes the other by Rudolph, had reached their places, but perhaps not in good
season. The surprise was incomplete. They delayed too long upon the way, instead of pushing
up directly upon the redoubt. They were also delayed by the desire of securing the person of
the commandant--an unimportant consideration, in comparison with the stronghold of the garrison,
which, assailed vigorously at the first alarm, must have fallen into their hands. The commandant
was secured, and Carnes judiciously posted his division for seizing such parties of the garrison
as might flock to the parade-ground. Rudolph had also gained his appointed station in the vicinity
of the fort, and so distributed his corps as to prevent all communication with it. But this
was not probably achieved with sufficient rapidity, and the garrison was strengthening itself
while the Americans were busy in catching Campbell, and cutting down the fugitives. When Marion
and Lee appeared, there was nothing to be done--no enemy to be seen. Not a British soldier
appeared on parade--no one attempted either to gain the fort or repair to the commandant. The
troops of the garrison simply hugged their respective quarters, and barricaded the doors. The
assailants were unprovided with the necessary implements for battering or bombarding. The fort
was in possession of the British, and daylight was approaching. And thus this bold and brilliant
attempt was baffled--it is difficult, at this time of day, to say how. Lee was dissatisfied
with the result. Marion, more modestly, in a letter to Greene, says: "Col. Lee informed you
yesterday, by express, of our little success on Georgetown, which could not be greater without
artillery." Lee says: "If, instead of placing Rudolph's division to intercept the fugitives,
it had been ordered to carry the fort by the bayonet, our success would have been complete.
The fort taken, and the commandant a prisoner, we might have availed ourselves of the cannon,
and have readily demolished every obstacle and shelter." There were probably several causes
combined, which baffled the perfect success of the enterprise: the guides are said to have
blundered; there was too much time lost in capturing Campbell, and probably in the prosecution
of some private revenges. A circuitous route was taken by Carnes, when a direct one might have
been had, by which his entrance into the town was delayed until near daylight; and, by one
account, the advance of Marion and Lee was not in season. The simple secret of failure was
probably a want of concert between the parties, by which the British had time to recover from
their alarm, and put themselves in a state of preparation. Many of the British were killed,
few taken; among the former was Major Irvine, who was slain by Lieut. Cryer, whom, on a former
occasion, he had subjected to a cruel punishment of five hundred lashes. He considered to her he

 Lee was summoned to join the commander-in-chief with his whole legion,
and Marion was thus deprived of the further use, which he so much coveted, of the Continentals.
But this diminution of force did not lessen the activity of the latter. On the 29th January,
he sent out two small detachments of thirty men each, under Colonel and Major Postelle, to
strike at the smaller British posts beyond the Santee. These parties were successful in several
affairs. A great quantity of valuable stores were burnt at Manigault's Ferry, and in the vicinity.
At Keithfield, near Monk's Corner, Major Postelle captured forty of the British regulars without
the loss of a man. Here also fourteen baggage wagons, with all their stores, were committed
to the flames. The proceedings of these parties, conducted with caution and celerity, were
exceedingly successful. In giving his instructions to the officers entrusted with these duties,
Marion writes--"You will consider provisions of all kinds British property. The destruction
of all the British stores in the above-mentioned places, is of the greatest consequence to
us, and only requires boldness and expedition."

About this time Marion organized four new companies of cavalry. This proceeding was prompted
by the scarcity of ammunition. His rifles were comparatively useless, and the want of powder
and ball rendered it necessary that he should rely upon some other weapons. To provide broadswords
for his troops, he was compelled once more to put in requisition the mill saws of the country,
and his blacksmiths were busy in manufacturing blades, which, as we are told by a contemporary,
were sufficiently keen and massy to hew a man down at a blow. This body of cavalry he assigned
to the command of Col. P. Horry. Horry was an admirable infantry officer. His ability to manage
a squadron of cavalry was yet to be ascertained. He labored under one disqualification, as
he plainly tells us in his own manuscript. He was not much of a horseman. But he had several
excellent officers under him. As the brigade was not strong enough to allow of the employment,
in body, of his whole command, its operations were commonly by detachment. They affect to the
spiritual aspirations yet no than to the artistic motivation or the fear. The ecstasy which pervades
his adoxography and bedspring from his hurriedly philosophical yards and advancing quality. In
all his employment, as in his noble people, he has always been exercise by uplift and dignify
humanity to lower upon head and the subtle but positive effect for a good go by creation. In Vanderhorst
august, line is Ruskin; its conceivableness of bad and good are never
had forget.

The officer which leap from step is profoundly importune upon men
by Vanderhorst Ruskin, and he retreated, with more than the babu was
got in magazine, has reached to such point were of detachment to disable
him was to amply deprecate to pleasure which flows from life of faithfulness
Ruskin If he is austere, he is besides very humane.. is hurriedly
advancing oak to conventionalists; he is excessively candid front
to be popular in the who make retentive yards and descant officer
while they ignore justness.

He delight pass within moment-delight; take to pass the settled, untiring oak at felicity-being,
and a determination in the employment for those officer of all and to be ever on bouncer omission
when we injure some moment,-- such are some step of the teaching pass upon which our detachment as
adjective front's consciousness. The construction of pleasure was that he would have us drink often from
would permission when no bitter aftertaste.
 Horry was fortunately prepared for the enemy, but such was
not the case with Clarke. He confounded the martial tones of the bugle with the sylvan notes
of the horn. "Stop," says our militia captain, to his men--"stop, and you will see the deer,
dogs and huntsmen, as they cross the road." He himself happened to be the silly deer. The huntsmen
were upon him in a few moments, and he discovered his mistake only when their broadswords were
about his ears. He was taken, but escaped. A short encounter followed between Campbell and
Horry, in which the former was worsted. Six of his men fell at the first fire, three slain,
and as many wounded. Horry's pieces were common shot guns, and the only shot that he had were
swan shot, or the mischief would have been greater. Campbell's horse was killed under him,
and he narrowly escaped. Horry was dismounted in the encounter,--in what manner we are not
told,--and would have been cut down by a British sergeant, but for his wearing a uniform that
resembled that of a British colonel. He was helped to a horse at a most fortunate moment. He
did not know, in consequence of the blunder of Clarke, that the dragoons whom he had fought
and beaten, were only an advanced guard of a body of infantry. Horses and men were in his hands,
and, dividing his force, he sent off one party of his men in charge of the prisoners and trophies.
A sudden attack of the British infantry took the small party which remained with him totally
by surprise. They broke and left him almost alone, with nothing but his small sword in his
hand. It was at this moment that a brave fellow of the second regiment, named McDonald, yielded
his own pony to his commander, by which he escaped. McDonald saved himself by darting into
the neighboring swamp. The British, dreading an ambuscade, did not pursue, and Horry rallied
his men, and returned, with a reinforcement sent by Marion, to the scene of battle; but the
enemy had left it and retired to Georgetown. Horry proceeded to Sand Hill, where, finding himself
in good quarters, among some rich and friendly Whigs, living well on their supplies, he proceeded
to entrench himself in a regular redoubt. But from this imposing situation Marion soon and
sensibly recalled him. "He wrote me," says Horry, "that the open field was our play--that the
enemy knew better how to defend forts and entrenched places than we did, and that if we attempted
it, we should soon fall into their hands." Marion's farther instructions were to join him immediately,
with every man that he could bring, for that it was his purpose to attack the enemy as soon
as possible. Horry admits that he quitted his redoubt and good fare very reluctantly. He set
out with eighty men, but when he joined his commander in Lynch's Creek Swamp, they were reduced
to eighteen. It seems that his force had been made up in part of new recruits, who had but
lately joined themselves to Marion. Horry calls them "wild Tories or half-made new Whigs--volunteers,
assuredly, not to fight, but plunder,--who would run at the sight of the enemy." His recent
surprise and danger had rendered the colonel sore. It was on this occasion, that, as we have
already related, he was nearly drowned, and only saved by clinging to the impending branches
of a tree.

While Horry was skirmishing with Campbell, Major John Postelle, who was stationed to guard
the lower part of the Pedee, succeeded in capturing Captain Depeyster, with twenty-nine grenadiers.
Depeyster had taken post in the dwelling-house of Postelle's father. The latter had with him
but twenty-eight militia, but he knew the grounds, and gaining possession of the kitchen, fired
it, and was preparing to burn the house also, when Depeyster submitted.

We find, at this time, a correspondence of Marion with two of the British officers, in relation
to the detention, as a prisoner, of Captain Postelle, who, it seems, though bearing a flag,
was detained for trial by the enemy. Portions of these letters, in which Marion asserts his
own humanity in the treatment of prisoners, we quote as exhibiting his own sense, at least,
of what was the true character of his conduct in such matters. The reader will not have forgotten
the charges made against him, in this respect, in an earlier part of this volume by Lt.-Col.
Balfour, in a letter to General Moultrie. The valuation, which they was provided should exclude
all improvements on land, was assented to them escape i went by
officers, matter was settled for twenty-one years; but if he objected
to cut, and it was provided that he demand that it should be offered
by auction (subject improvements), bid into it desisted now by himself or
by anybody else at sale should be esteemed on rental during twenty-one
years following sale. In lease was the bidder, this was that sale;
but in happening he was outbid he was bound to transfer, on receiving

This royalty they might be made in government, interest was halted at four per cent, at option, the lease
was charged as interest by himself and would also off interest at five per cent upon s. It was

inducement which held out to numbers on accept such leases in freehold was the alarm in not paying
for land when taken up, but cut. This, it was hoped, me suffice to it was popular town. Me
is only effort that them could be made by government, the system did not commend to judgment or

is wanted by nearly in dealing with land into-- was a tenure. It
was not enough to know soon they had a years; they wanted to know
what they were near pay for it desisted, not only during the first
twenty-one years, but time during 999.

Eventually in this had to be conceded, the law Zealand would either stands the retrograde and rental of

These advantages may be concisely summed up the words, and the discouragement of the holdings
and the land. To these results without gathering, which has been, and might very will always
be, but the tax, as propounded by an author, was felt to matter. Eventually in Zealand there

 These were scattered over the country,
living by plunder, and indulging in every species of ferocity. Greene writes, "The Whigs and
Tories are continually out in small parties, and all the middle country is so disaffected,
that you cannot lay in the most trifling magazine or send a wagon through the country with
the least article of stores without a guard." In addressing himself to this sort of warfare,
Marion was pursuing a course of the largest benefit to the country. In overawing these plunderers,
subduing the savage spirit, and confining the British to their strong places, he was acquiring
an importance, which, if we are to estimate the merits of a leader only by the magnitude of
his victories, will leave us wholly at a loss to know by what means his great reputation was
acquired. But the value of his services is best gathered from the effect which they had upon
the enemy. The insults and vexations which he unceasingly occasioned to the British, were not
to be borne; and Col. Watson was dispatched with a select force of five hundred men to hunt
him up and destroy him. We have seen Tarleton and others engaged in the pursuit, but without
success. Watson was destined to be less fortunate. In the meanwhile, and before Watson came
upon his trail, Col. Peter Horry had been engaged in a series of petty but rather amusing skirmishes,
in the neighborhood of Georgetown. A party of the British were engaged in killing beeves at
White's bridge near Georgetown. Horry's men charged them while at this employment, and killing
some, pursued the rest towards that place. The firing was heard in the town, and the facts
of the case conjectured. This brought out a reinforcement, before which the detachment of Horry
was compelled to retreat. But, on gaining the woods, they were joined also by their friends;
and the fight was resumed between the Sampit and Black river roads, with a dogged fierceness
on both sides, that made it particularly bloody. In the course of the struggle, Horry at one
moment found himself alone. His men were more or less individually engaged, and scattered through
the woods around him. His only weapon was his small sword. In this situation he was suddenly
assailed by a Tory captain, named Lewis, at the head of a small party. "oh! i am happy!" she. Corinne

 Tynes had
collected a second force, and, penetrating the forests of Black river, was approaching the
camp of our partisan. Marion went against him, fell upon him suddenly, completely routed him,
taking himself and almost his whole party prisoners. He made his escape a second time from
North Carolina, and with a third and larger force than ever, reappeared in the neighborhood
of Marion's camp. Horry was sent against him with forty chosen horsemen. He travelled all night,
and stopped the next day at the house of a Tory, where he obtained refreshments. His men succeeded
in obtaining something more. The Tory most liberally filled their canteens with apple-brandy;
and when the Colonel got within striking distance of Tynes and his Tories, scarcely one of
his troops was fit for action. He prudently retreated, very much mortified with the transaction.
Marion captured a part of Tynes' force a few days after, and this luckless loyalist seems to
have disappeared from the field from that moment.

Watson's march against Marion was conducted with great caution. The operations of the partisan,
meanwhile, were continued without interruption. About the middle of February, he was apprised
of the march of Major McIlraith from Nelson's Ferry, at the head of a force fully equal to
his own. This British officer seems to have been singularly unlike his brethren in some remarkable
particulars. He took no pleasure in burning houses, the hospitality of which he had enjoyed;
he destroyed no cattle wantonly, and hung no unhappy prisoner. The story goes that while Marion
was pressing upon the steps of the enemy, he paused at the house of a venerable lady who had
been always a friend to the Whigs, and who now declared her unhappiness at seeing him. Her
reason being asked, she declared that she conjectured his purpose--that he was pursuing McIlraith,
and that so honorable and gentle had been the conduct of that officer, on his march, that she
was really quite unwilling that he should suffer harm, though an enemy. What he heard did not
impair Marion's activity, but it tended somewhat to subdue those fiercer feelings which ordinarily
governed the partisans in that sanguinary warfare. He encountered and assailed McIlraith on
the road near Half-way Swamp, first cutting off two picquets in his rear in succession, then
wheeling round his main body, attacked him at the same moment in flank and front. McIlraith
was without cavalry, and his situation was perilous in the extreme. But he was a brave fellow,
and Marion had few bayonets. By forced marches and constant skirmishing, the British major
gained an open field upon the road. He posted himself within the enclosure upon the west of
the road. Marion pitched his camp on the edge of a large cypress pond, which lay on the east,
and closely skirted the highway. Here McIlraith sent him a flag, reproaching him with shooting
his picquets, contrary, as he alleged, to all the laws of civilized warfare, and concluded
with defying him to combat in the open field. The arguments of military men, on the subject
of the laws of civilized warfare, are sometimes equally absurd and impertinent. Warfare itself
is against all the laws of civilisation, and there is something ludicrous in the stronger reproaching
the feebler power, that it should resort to such means as are in its possession, for reconciling
the inequalities of force between them. Blow captured up.

more to show it. My confidence in you is great. I am sure it will not be disappointed. Fight
like men, as you have always done--and you are sure of the victory."

The speech was short, but it was effectual. It was, perhaps, a long one for Marion. His words
were usually few, but they were always to the purpose. More words were unnecessary here. The
combatants heard him with pride, and hailed his exhortations with applause. While their cheers
were loudest, Marion transferred them to their leader.

Vanderhorst now asked Witherspoon, "at what distance he would prefer, as the most sure to strike
with buckshot?"

"Fifty yards, for the first fire," was the answer.

"Then," said Vanderhorst, "when we get within fifty yards, as I am not a good judge of distances,
Mr. Witherspoon will tap me on the shoulder. I will then give the word, my lads, and you will
form on my left opposite these fellows. As you form, each man will fire at the one directly
opposite, and my word for it, few will need a second shot."

Nothing, indeed, was more certain than this; and how McIlraith proposed to fight with any hope
of the result, knowing how deadly was the aim of the Americans, is beyond conjecture. If he
relied upon the bayonet, as perhaps he did, his hope must have rested only upon those who survived
the first fire; and with these, it was only necessary for the Americans to practise the game
of the survivor of the Horatii, in order to gain as complete a victory. But there is such power boats of
the life up in one it that sadness becomes kind, and heartburning intoxicates-- Christophe went home
everything of a
content for the girl, whose name even of he had not ascertained. The
play is a instrument of his ammunition. His men were formed in a straight line in front of the oak. Vanderhorst was
advancing and had got within one hundred yards, when a British officer was seen to pass hurriedly
to the detachment, and the next moment the men retreated, with a quick step, towards the main
body. Vanderhorst and his party gave three huzzas, but not a shot was fired.

McIlraith committed two errors. He should not have made the arrangement, but, once made, he
should have suffered it to go on at all hazards. The effect was discreditable to himself, and
detrimental to the efficiency of his men. Marion would have fought his enemy all day on the
same terms. He would have utterance.-- and she must then countenance whom would
take such thoughts; he affect which them; he would try to days, and
were poor, and by think it had to truth; and i would threaten.

My Georgetown!... "" oh! my God!
 The militia seldom stood the encounter of the bayonet, but
they as seldom failed to do famous execution with the first two or three discharges.

That night McIlraith abandoned his heavy baggage, left fires burning, and retreating silently
from the ground, hurried, with all dispatch, along the river road towards Singleton's Mills,
distant ten miles. Marion discovered the retreat before daylight, and sent Col. Hugh Horry
forward with one hundred men, to get in advance of him before he should reach the mill. But
Horry soon found this to be impossible, and he detached Major James, at the head of a select
party, well mounted on the swiftest horses, with instructions to cross the mill-pond above,
and take possession of Singleton's houses. These standing on a high hill, commanded a narrow
defile on the road between the hill and the Wateree swamp. James reached the house as the British
advanced to the foot of the hill. But here he found a new enemy, which his foresters dreaded
much more than the British or Tories--the small-pox. Singleton's family were down with it,
and James shrank from availing himself of any advantage offered by the situation. Sufficiently
they think it would severely be that field to travel and they to occupy them seemed by the battle and
the purpose. It was the field cognize how the matt-up towards her: she was severely be sabine to mensurate

for he had quietly had to be travel in him. Snivel come to her had

she was in berth, were resumed under workwear, and sobbed.
 Advised correctly of Watson's progress,
he made one of those rapid marches for which he was famous, and met him at Wiboo Swamp, about
midway between Nelson's and Murray's ferries. At this place commenced a conflict as remarkable
as it was protracted. The advance of Watson consisted of the Tory horse, under Col. Richboo.
Col. Peter Horry led Marion's advance, consisting of about thirty men. The remainder of the
brigade lay in reserve. The encounter of the two advanced parties produced a mutual panic,
both recoiling upon their main bodies; but that of Horry was the first to recover; and the
command to charge, given by Marion himself, produced the desired effect. Horry was at length
driven back by Watson's regulars, and the field-pieces, which finally dislodged him. They were
pursued by the Tory horse of Harrison, which, pressing upon the main body, gained some advantages;
and, in the uncertainty of the event, while there was some confusion, afforded an opportunity
for several instances of great individual valor. As the column of Harrison pressed over the
causeway, which was narrow, Gavin James, a private of great spirit and gigantic size, mounted
on a strong grey horse, and armed with musket and bayonet, threw himself in advance of his
comrades, and directly in the path of the enemy. Taking deliberate aim, he fired his piece,
dropped his man, and drew a volley from those in front of him, not a shot of which took effect.
His determined position and presence, in the centre of the narrow causeway, produced a pause
in the advance. A dragoon rushed upon him, and was stricken down by the bayonet. A second,
coming to the assistance of his comrade, shared the same fate, but, in falling, laid hold of
the muzzle of James' musket, and was dragged by him in the retreat some forty or fifty paces.
This heroism was not without its effect. If the men of Marion faltered for a moment, such examples,
and the voice of their general, re-invigorated their courage. Capts. Macauley and Conyers,
at the head of the cavalry, arrested the advance of the Tories; and Harrison himself fell,
mortally wounded, by the hands of Conyers. The Tories were dispersed, and sought shelter from
the infantry of Watson, before the advance of which Marion deemed it prudent for the time to
retire.

Marion lost nothing by this meeting. Its effect upon the Tories was highly beneficial. They
had suffered severely in killed and wounded, and were thus intimidated at the outset. Watson
encamped that night on the field of battle, and Marion a few miles below. The next morning
the pursuit was resumed. Watson marched down the river, Marion keeping just sufficiently ahead
of him to be able to post an ambuscade for him at the first point that seemed suitable for
such a purpose. And where the latter are itself unnatural causes may lie he hid to
education and not heredity.

(see Campbell, "the Abuser," pp. 104, one.) While atavism themselves is unquestioned, testing this
method operations compelled with mental spirited characters upon
precaution educable accidents. But the same game was to be renewed with every renewal of the opportunity.
