PREFACE.

I must frankly own, that if I had known, beforehand, that this book would have cost me the
labour which it has, I should never have been courageous enough to commence it. What moved
me, in the first instance, to attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which
I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement. I have always thought that
there is no more fruitful source of family discontent than a housewife's badly-cooked dinners
and untidy ways. Men are now so well served out of doors,--at their clubs, well-ordered taverns,
and dining-houses, that in order to compete with the attractions of these places, a mistress
must be thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of cookery, as well as be perfectly
conversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable home.

In this book I have attempted to give, under the chapters devoted to cookery, an intelligible
arrangement to every recipe, a list of the ingredients, a plain statement of the mode of preparing
each dish, and a careful estimate of its cost, the number of people for whom it is sufficient,
and the time when it is seasonable. For the matter of the recipes, I am indebted, in some measure,
to many correspondents of the "Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine," who have obligingly placed
at my disposal their formulas for many original preparations. A large private circle has also
rendered me considerable service. A diligent study of the works of the best modern writers
on cookery was also necessary to the faithful fulfilment of my task. Friends in England, Scotland,
Ireland, France, and Germany, have also very materially aided me. I have paid great attention
to those recipes which come under the head of "COLD MEAT COOKERY." But in the department belonging
to the Cook I have striven, too, to make my work something more than a Cookery Book, and have,
therefore, on the best authority that I could obtain, given an account of the natural history
of the animals and vegetables which we use as food. I have followed the animal from his birth
to his appearance on the table; have described the manner of feeding him, and of slaying him,
the position of his various joints, and, after giving the recipes, have described the modes
of carving Meat, Poultry, and Game. Skilful artists have designed the numerous drawings which
appear in this work, and which illustrate, better than any description, many important and
interesting items. The coloured plates are a novelty not without value.

Besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to the cook's department,
there are chapters devoted to those of the other servants of the household, who have all, I
trust, their duties clearly assigned to them.

Towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the "Management of Children"----"The
Doctor," the latter principally referring to accidents and emergencies, some of which are certain
to occur in the experience of every one of us; and the last chapter contains "Legal Memoranda,"
which will be serviceable in cases of doubt as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations
between Landlord and Tenant, Tax-gatherer and Tax-payer, and Tradesman and Customer.

These chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully entitled to confidence; those on medical
subjects by an experienced surgeon, and the legal matter by a solicitor.

I wish here to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have received during the
progress of this work, and have only further to add, that I trust the result of the four years'
incessant labour which I have expended will not be altogether unacceptable to some of my countrymen
and countrywomen.

ISABELLA BEETON.
