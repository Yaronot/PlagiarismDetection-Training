THE LONG CHANCE

CHAPTER I

It was sunrise on the Colorado desert.

As the advance guard of dawn emerged from behind the serrated peaks to the east and paused
on their snow-encrusted summits before charging down the slopes into the open desert to rout
the lingering shadows of the night, a coyote came out of his den in the tumbled malpais at
the foot of the range, pointed his nose skyward and voiced his matutinal salute to the Hosts
of Light.

Presently, far in the distant waste, seven dark objects detached themselves from the shadows
and crawled toward the mountains. Like motes swimming in a beam of light, they came out of
the Land of Nowhere, in the dim shimmering vistas over west, where the gray line of grease-wood
met the blue of the horizon. Slowly they assumed definite shape; and the coyote ceased his
orisons to speculate upon the ultimate possibility of breakfast and this motley trio of "desert
rats" with their burro train, who dared invade his desolate waterless kingdom.

For, with the exception of the four burros, the three men who followed in their wake did, indeed,
offer the rare spectacle of variety in this land of superlative monotony. One of the men wore
a peaked Mexican straw hat, a dirty white cotton undershirt, faded blue denim overalls and
a pair of shoes much too large for him; this latter item indicating a desire to get the most
for his money, after the invariable custom of a primitive people. He carried a peeled catclaw
gad in his right hand, and with this gad he continually urged to a shuffling half-trot some
one of the four burros. This man was a Cahuilla Indian.

His two companions were white men. The younger of the pair was a man under thirty years of
age, with kind bright eyes and the drawn but ruddy face of one whose strength seems to have
been acquired more from athletic sports than by hard work. He was tall, broad-shouldered, slim-
waisted, big-hipped and handsome; he stepped along through the clinging sand with the lithe
careless grace of a mountain lion. An old greasy wide-brimmed gray felt hat, pinched to a "Montana
peak," was shoved back on his curly black head; his shirt, of light gray wool, had the sleeves
rolled to the elbow, revealing powerful forearms tanned to the complexion of those of the Indian.
He seemed to revel in the airy freedom of a pair of dirty old white canvas trousers, and despite
the presence of a long-barreled blue gun swinging at his hip he would have impressed an observer
as the embodiment of kindly good nature and careless indifference to convention, provided his
own personal comfort was assured.

The other white man was plainly an alien in the desert. He was slight, blonde, pale--a city
man--with hard blue eyes set so close together that one understood instantly something of the
nature of the man as well as the urgent necessity for his thick-lensed, gold-rimmed spectacles.
He wore a new Panama hat, corded riding breeches and leggings. He was clean-shaven and sinfully
neat. He wore no side-arms and appeared as much out of harmony with his surroundings as might
a South American patriot at a Peace Conference.

"I say," he began presently, "how much further is it to this prospect hole of yours, if, indeed,
you have a prospect as you represented to me a week ago?" His tone was fretful, peevish, complaining.
One would readily have diagnosed the seat of his trouble. He had come prepared to ride--and
he had been forced to walk.

The young man frowned. He seemed on the point of swearing, but appearing to think better of
it, he replied banteringly, "Por ahi. Por ahi."

"What in blazes does that mean?"

"Oh, I was just talking the language of the country--a language, by the way, toward which you
seem most indifferently inclined. 'Por ahi' means 'a considerable way,' 'a right smart piece,
I reckon,' and conveys about the same relative amount of definite information as manana. Never
having measured the distance to my prospect, I have tried for the past two days to give you
an approximate idea. But in this country you must know that distance is a deceptive, 'find
X' sort of proposition--so please refrain from asking me that same question every two miles. They

"i flickered't be Sovereign, where his bangle know that had to worry
you break t; nor i was ill by France, i doesn them has rather, and
was given after Gold."

At smile, Tale away.

But the man from Boston! He was quickly read. The Desert Rat gave him until midnight that night,
but he wilted at ten o'clock.

"A sore heel, a mean soul and no spunk have killed more men than whisky" the Desert Rat commented
whimsically, as he pulled the weak brother out of a cluster of catclaw. "Boston, you're an
awful nuisance --you are, for a fact. You've had water three times to our once, and yet you
go to work and peter out with Chuckwalla Tanks only five miles away. Why, I've often covered
that distance on my hands and knees. Come, now, buck up. Hang on to the rear cross of one of
the pack saddles and let the jack snake you along."

"I can't, I'm exhausted. I'll die if I don't have a drink."

"No, you'll not die. No such luck. And there isn't any more water. However, you've been spoiled
in the raising, so I suppose we'll have to defer to you--particularly since it's my fault that
we're short of water. What can't be cured must be endured, and I can't let you die."

He spoke to the Indian, who took two canteens and departed into the night.

"He's going to hike on ahead to Chuckwalla Tanks and bring back some water for you, Boston"
the Desert Rat explained. "He'll return about daylight, and we'll wait here until he arrives.
It's dangerous, but the jacks aren't in a bad way yet. They can make it to the Tanks, even
after sunrise."

"Thanks" murmured the sufferer.

The Desert Rat grinned. "You're getting on" he commented.

"Where is Chuckwalla Tanks?" The tenderfoot sat up and stared after the figure of the departing
Indian, still visible in the dim moonlight.

"In a little gorge between those low hills. You can just make out their outlines."

"Yes, I see them. And after that the closest water is where?"

"The Colorado river--forty miles due south. But we're headed northwest and must depend on tanks
and desert water-holes. It's hard to tell how close one is to water on that course. But it
doesn't matter. We'll refill the kegs at Chuckwalla Tanks. There's most always water there."

"And you say the Colorado river is forty miles due south."

"Well, between forty and fifty."

"Much obliged for the information, I'm sure."

He straightened suddenly and drew back his arm. The Desert Rat saw that he was about to hurl
a large smooth stone, and simultaneously he dodged and reached for his gun. But he was a fifth
of a second too slow. The stone struck him on the side of the head, rather high up, and he
collapsed into a bloody heap.

On the instant the footsore man from Boston developed an alacrity and definiteness of purpose
that would have surprised the Desert Rat, had he been in condition to observe it. He seized
the gad which the mozo had dropped, climbed upon the lightest laden burro and, driving the
others before him, set off for Chuckwalla Tanks. The Indian had disappeared by this time, and
there was little danger of overtaking him; so with the two low hills as his objective point,
the Easterner circled a mile out of the direct course which he knew the Indian would take,
and when the dawn commenced to show in the east he herded the pack-animals down into a swale
between two sand-dunes. With remarkable cunning he decided to scout the territory before proceeding
further; hence, as soon as there was light enough to permit of a good view, he climbed to the
crest of a high dune and looked out over the desert. As far as he could see no living thing
moved; so he drove the pack train out of the swale and headed for the gorge between the hills.
The thirsty burros broke into a run, hee-hawing with joy as they sniffed the water, and within
a few minutes man and beasts were drinking in common at Chuckwalla Tanks.

The man permitted them to drink their fill, after which they fell to grazing on the short grass
which grew in the draw. While he realized the necessity for haste if he was to succeed in levanting
with the gold, the tenderfoot had been too long a slave to his creature comforts to face another
day without breakfast. He abstracted some grub from one of the packs and stayed the pangs of
hunger. Then he bathed his blistered feet, filled the water kegs, rounded up his pack train
and departed up the draw. After traveling a mile the draw broadened out into the desert, and
the man from Boston turned south and headed for the Rio Colorado. He was walking now and appeared
to have forgotten about his blistered heel, for at times he broke into a run, beating the burros,
screaming curses at them with all the venom of his wolfish soul, for he was pursued now by
the fragments of his conscience. His attack upon the Desert Rat had been the outgrowth of a
sudden murderous impulse, actuated fully as much by his hatred and fear of the man as by his
desire to possess the gold. One moment he would shudder at the thought that he had committed
murder; the next he was appalled at the thought that after all he had only stunned the man--that
even now the Desert Rat and his Indian retainer were tracking him through the waste, bent on
wreaking summary vengeance.

He need not have worried so prematurely. A low range of black malpais buttes stretched between
him and the man he had despoiled, and as yet the direction of his flight could not be observed.
He drifted rapidly south and presently disappeared into one of those long swales which slope
gradually to the river.

Here, weaving his way among the ironwood that grow thickly in this section of the desert, for
the first time since the commission of his crime he felt safe.

CHAPTER II

It was still dark when the Desert Rat regained consciousness. He lay for quite a while thereafter,
turning things over in his befuddled brain, striving to gather together the tangled thread
of the events of the night. Eventually he succeeded in driving his faculties into line. He
rolled over, got to his hands and knees and paused a minute to get a fresh grip on himself.
His aching head hung low, like that of a dying horse; in the silence of the night he could
hear the drip, drip of his blood into the sand.

Presently he began to move. Round and round in the sage he crawled, like some weary wounded
animal, breaking off the rotten dead limbs which, lie close to the base of the shrub. Three
piles of sage he gathered, placing the piles in a row twenty feet apart. Then he set fire to
them and watched them burst into flame.

It was the desert call for help: three fires in a row by night, three columns of smoke against
the horizon by day--and the Cahuilla Indian, coming down the draw from Chuckwalla Tanks five
miles away, saw flaming against the dawn this appeal of the white man he loved, for whom he
lived and labored. Straight across the desert he ran, with the long tireless stride that was
the heritage of his people. His large heavy shoes retarded him; he removed them, tucked them
under his arm and with a lofty disdain of tarantulas and side-winders fled barefooted. Three-
quarters of an hour from the time he had first seen the signal-fires, the mozo was kneeling
beside the stricken Desert Rat, who lay unconscious close to one of the fires. The water from
the mozo's canteen revived him, however, and presently he sat up, while the Cahuilla washed
the gash in his head and bound it up with his master's bandanna handkerchief.

As the Indian worked, the white man related what had occurred and how. He recalled his conversation
with his assailant, and shrewdly surmised that he would head for the Colorado river, after
having first secured a supply of water at Chuckwalla Tanks. The Desert Rat's plan of action
was quickly outlined.

"You will help me to get to the Tanks, where I'll have water and a chance to rest for a day
or two until I'm able to travel; then I'll head for the Rio Colorado and wait for you in Ehrenburg.
I'll keep one canteen and you can take the other; I have matches and my six-shooter, and I
can live on quail and chuckwallas until I get to the river. You have your knife. Track that
man, if you have to follow him into hell, and when you find him--no, don't kill him; he isn't
worth it, and besides, that's my work. It's your job to run him down. Bring him to me in Ehrenburg."

It was past noon when they arrived at the Tanks, and the Indian was carrying the Desert Rat
on his back. While the man was quite conscious, he was still too weak from the effect of the
blow and loss of blood to travel in the heat.

At the Tanks the Indian picked up the trail of four burros and a man. He refilled his canteen,
took a long drink from the Tank, grunted an "Adios, senor," and departed up the draw at the
swift dog-trot which is typical of the natural long-distance runner.

The Desert Rat gazed after him. "God bless your crude untutored soul, you best of mozos" he
murmured. "You have one virtue that most white men lack--you'll stay put and be faithful to
your salt. And now, just to be on the safe side, I'll make my will and write out a detailed
account of this entire affair--in case."

For half an hour he scribbled haltingly in an old russet-covered note- book. This business
attended to, he crawled into the meager shade of a palo verde tree and fell asleep. When he
awoke an hour or two later and looked down the draw to the open desert, he saw that another
sandstorm was raging.

"That settles it" he soliloquized contentedly. "The trail is wiped out and the best Indian
on earth can't follow a trail that doesn't exist, But that wretched little bandit is out in
this sandstorm, and the jacks will stampede on him and he'll pay his bill to society--with
interest. When the wind dies down the pack outfit will drift back to this water-hole, and when
Old Reliable finds out that the trail is lost, he'll drift back too. Anyhow, if the burros
don't show we'll trail them by the buzzards and find the packs. Ah, you great mysterious wonderful
desert, how good you've been to me! I can sleep now--in peace."

He slept. When he awoke again, he discovered to his surprise that he had been walking in his
sleep. He had an empty canteen over his shoulder and he was bareheaded. His head ached and
throbbed, his tongue and throat felt dry and cottony; he seemed to have been wandering in a
weary land for a long time, for no definite reason, and he was thirsty.

He glanced around him for the water-hole beside which he had lain down to sleep and await the
mozo and the burros. On all sides the vast undulating sea of sand and sage stretched to the
horizon, and then the Desert Rat understood. He had been delirious. The phase of diarrhea, His
veratrum, was married about suddenly when equally if the emptying, will rarely collar it
am to hours, is sometimes if the best t says up or maintain great anybody. But if not, and
reported it increases in frequency, or go less pagan, or get the town is matt-up at stomach, been

 For the Desert
Rat was a philosopher, and even at this ghastly spectacle his sense of humor did not desert
him. He sat down on the skull of one of the burros and laughed--a dry cackling gobble.

"What a great wonderful genius of a desert it is!" he mumbled. "It's worth dying in after all--a
fitting mausoleum for a Desert Rat. Here I come staggering in, with murder in my heart, stultifying
my manhood with the excuse that it would be justice in the abstract, and the Lord shows me
an example of the vanity and littleness of life. All right, Boston, old man. You win, I guess,
but I've got an ace coppered, and even if you do get through, some day you'll pay the price."

He sat there on the bleached skull, his head in his hands, trembling, pondering, yet unafraid
in the face of the knowledge that here his wanderings must end. He was right. It was a spot
eminently befitting the finish of such a man. It was at least exclusive, for the vulgar and
the common would never perish here. In all the centuries since its formation no human feet,
save his own and those of the man whose skeleton lay before him, had ever awakened the echoes
in its silent halls. Pioneers, dreamers both, men of the Great Outdoors, each had heard the
call of the silent places--each had essayed to fight his way into the treasure vaults of the
desert; and as they had begun, so had they finished--in the arms of Nature, who had claimed
the utmost of their love.

The Desert Rat was a true son of the desert. To him the scowl of the sun-baked land at midday
had always turned to a smile of promise at dawn; to him the darkest night was but the forerunner
of another day of glorious battle, when he could rise out of the sage, stretch his young legs
and watch the sun rise over his empire. He knew the desert--he saw the issue now, but still
he did not falter.

"Poor little wife," he mumbled; "poor little unborn baby! You'll hope, through the long years,
waiting for me to come back--and you'll never know!"

His faltering gaze wandered down the canyon where his own tracks and those of the dead shone
gray against the brown of the sun-swept wash. He had followed a trail that might have been
ten years old; perhaps, in the years to come, some other wanderer would see his tracks, halting,
staggering, uncertain, blazing the ancient call of the desert: "Come to me or I perish." Do not

Carefully he raised piece after piece of the natural mosaic, inverted it and laid it back in
its appointed place. At the end of two hours he finished. There, in inlaid letters of creamy
white against the desert brown, his message flared almost imperishable:

    Friend, look in my canteen and see that I get justice.

A century must pass before that message faded; as for the coming of the messenger, he would
leave that to the Almighty.

The Desert Rat was going fast now. He moved back a few feet, fearful that at the end he might
obliterate his message. With his fading gaze fixed on the mouth of the canyon he lay waiting,
hoping, praying, brave to the last ... and presently help came.

It was the Night Watchman!

CHAPTER III

Serenely indifferent to the fact that but a few hours' average running time intervenes between
it and San Francisco on the north, and Los Angeles on the south, the little desert station
of San Pasqual has always insisted upon remaining a frontier town.

One can pardon San Pasqual readily for this apparent apathy. Not to do so would savor strongly
of an application of the doctrine of personal responsibility in the matter of a child with
a club-foot. San Pasqual isn't responsible. It has nothing to be proud of, nothing to incite
even a sporadic outburst of civic pride. It never had. 

All our folks to expect you wouldn, water-container. They are heed to grasping had the period in glory;

 Originally the San Pasqualians
had christened him "Psalm Singer," because of the fact that once, during a revival held by
an itinerant evangelist in a tent next door to the Silver Dollar saloon, the buck had attended
regularly, attracted by the melody of a little portable organ, the plaintive strains of which
appeared to charm his heathen soul. An unorthodox citizen, in the sheer riot of his imagination,
had saddled the buck with his new name. It had stuck to him, and since in the vernacular psalm
singer was pronounced "sam singer," the Indian came in time to be known by that name and would
answer to none other.

Donna grew up slightly different from the other little girls in San Pasqual. For instance:
she was never allowed to play in the dirt of the main street with other children; she wore
white dresses that were always clean, new ribbons in her hair; she always carried a handkerchief;
she attended the little public school with the belfry but no bell, and her mother trained her
in domestic science and the precepts of religion, which, lacking definite direction perhaps
by reason of the fact that there was no church in San Pasqual, served, nevertheless, as a bulwark
against the assaults of vice and vulgarity which, in a frontier town, are very thinly veiled.
As a child she was neither precocious nor shy. From a rather homely, long-legged gangling girl
of fourteen she emerged apparently by a series of swift transitions into a young lady at sixteen,
giving promise of a beauty which lay, not so much in her physical attractions, which were generous,
but in that easily discernible nobility of character which indicates beauty of soul--that superlative
beauty which entitles its possessor to be alluded to as "sweet," rather than pretty or handsome.

When Donna was nearly seventeen years old her mother died. It was the consensus of opinion
that heart trouble had something to do with it. In fact, Mrs. Corblay had often complained
of pains in her heart and was subject to fainting spells; besides which, there was that in
her eyes which seemed to predicate a heartache of many years' standing. At any rate, she fainted
at the eating-house one day and they carried her home. She passed away very quietly the same
night, leaving an estate which consisted of Donna, the two Indian servants, and a quantity
of coin in a teapot in the cupboard at the Hat Ranch which upon investigation was found to
total the stupendous sum of two hundred and twenty-eight dollars and ninety-five cents.

There was no one except Donna to attend to the funeral arrangements, and for eight hours following
her mother's death she was too distracted to think of anything but her great grief. Soft Wind
prepared her mistress for the grave after a well-meant but primitive fashion, while Sam Singer
squatted all morning in the sand in front of the compound and smoked innumerable cigarettes.
Presently he got up, went to his own little cabin within the enclosure and was invisible for
ten minutes. When he emerged he was clad in a new pair of "bull breeches," a white stiff-bosomed
shirt without a collar but with a brass collar button doing duty nevertheless, while a red
silk handkerchief, with the ends drawn through a ring fashioned from a horseshoe nail, enveloped
his swarthy neck. He had rummaged through the stock of hats and appropriated a Grand Army hat
with cord and tassels, and arrayed thus Sam Singer walked up the tracks to San Pasqual.

Arrived here Sam's very appearance heralded news of grave importance at the Hat Ranch. Such
extraordinary and unwonted attention to dress could portend but one of two things--a journey
or a funeral. Inasmuch, however, as Sam was coatless and Mrs. Corblay had been carried home
ill the day before, San Pasqual allowed itself one guess and won.

To those who sought to question him, however, Sam Singer had nothing more polite than a tribal
grunt. He proceeded directly to the Silver Dollar saloon, where he held converse with a man
who seemed much interested in the news which Sam had to impart, for he nodded gravely several
times, gave Sam fifty cents and a cigar and then hurried around to the public telephone station
in "Doc" Taylor's drug store.

Five minutes later, by some mysterious person, Mrs. Daniel Pennycook, wife of the yardmaster,
was informed over the telephone that Donnie Corblay's mother was dead.

"So I understand" replied Mrs. Pennycook volubly. "Poor thing! There was always somethin' so
mysterious like about--"

The use of the word "like" was habit with Mrs. Pennycook. She rarely took a decided stand in
anything except Mr. Pennycook, and always modified her modifying adjective with the word "like";
an annoying practice which had always rendered her an object of terror to Mrs. Corblay. To
the latter it always seemed as if Mrs. Pennycook was desirous of saying something nasty, but
lacked the courage to come out flatfooted with it.

Her unknown informant interrupted, or attempted to interrupt, but Mrs. Pennycook was now started
on her favorite topic, in such haste that she failed to give the customary telephonic challenge:

"Who's speaking, please?"

She continued. "Yes, she was kinder quiet like any kept to herself like--"

"Well," said the unknown, "she's dead now, and that little daughter o' hers is all alone down
there with her Indian woman. If you knew Mrs. Corblay was dead, why in blue blazes didn't you
or some other woman in this heartless village go down there and comfort that child? I've asked
three of your neighbors already, but they're washin' or dustin' or cookin' or somethin'."

"I was so terrible shocked like when I heard it--"

"Well, if the shock's over, for decency's sake, Mrs. Pennycook, go down to the Hat Ranch and
keep that little girl comp'ny till this afternoon."

"Who's talkin'?" demanded Mrs. Pennycook belligerently.

"I am."

"Who are you?"

"Nobody!"

For several seconds Mrs. Pennycook shot questions into the transmitter, but receiving no response
she hung up, furious at having been denied the inalienable right of her sex to the last word.
Shortly thereafter her worthy spouse, Dan Pennycook, came in for his lunch. To him Mrs. Pennycook
imparted the tale of the strange man who had rung her up, demanding that she go down to the
Hat Ranch and see Donnie Corblay. Pennycook's stupid good-natured face clouded.

"Then," he demanded, "why don't you do it? I've been workin' with that string of empties below
town all mornin', an' if any woman in this charitable community passed me goin' to the Hat
Ranch I didn't see her. It's a shame. Put on your other things right after lunch, Arabella,
an' go down. I'll go with you."

"But the gall o' the man, askin' me to do this! I intended goin' anyhow, but him ringin' me
up so sudden like, I--"

"My dear," said Mr. Pennycook, "he paid you a compliment."

"Humph" responded Mrs. Pennycook. Then she sniffed. She continued to sniff at intervals during
the meal; she was still sniffing when later she joined her husband at the front gate and set
off with him down the tracks to the Hat Ranch.

Arrived at the Hat Ranch Mrs. Pennycook saw at once that Donna was "too upset like" to have
any of the details of her mother's funeral thrust upon her. Here was a situation which required
the supervision of a calm, executive person--Mrs. Daniel Pennycook, for instance. At any rate
Mrs. Pennycook decided to take charge. She was first on the scene and naturally the task was
hers, not only as a matter of principle but also by right of discovery.

Now, under the combined attentions of Donna, Mrs. Corblay and Soft Wind, the house, while primitive,
had, nevertheless, been made comfortable and kept immaculate. But there is a superstition rampant
in all provincial communities which dictates that the first line of action to be pursued when
there is a death in the family is to scrub the house thoroughly from cellar to garret, and
Mrs. Pennycook had been inoculated with the virus of this superstition very early in life.
She tucked up her skirts, seized a broom and a mop, rounded up Soft Wind and proceeded to produce
chaos where neatness and order had always reigned.

It was at this juncture that Donna Corblay first gave evidence of having a mind of her own.
She dried her tears and gently but firmly informed Mrs. Pennycook that the house had been thoroughly
cleaned and scrubbed three days previous. She begged Mrs. Pennycook to desist. Mrs. Pennycook
desisted, for if Donna couched her request in the language of entreaty, her young eyes flashed
a stern command, and Mrs. Pennycook was not deficient in the intuition of her sex. So she composed
herself in a rocking chair and by blunt brutal questioning presently ascertained that Mrs.
Corblay had left her daughter two hundred and twenty-eight dollars and ninety-five cents.

This decided Mrs. Pennycook. She dilated upon the importance of having a clergyman come down
from Bakersfield for the funeral, and suggested the services (at the metropolitan rates usually
accorded such functionaries) of the local alleged quartette, which regularly made night hideous
in San Pasqual's lone barber shop.

"It'll be kinder nice like, don't you think, Donna?" she queried.

Donna nodded dubiously.

"An' what was your poor dear mamma's church?" continued Mrs. Pennycook.

"She didn't have any" Donna answered, truthfully enough.

Again Mrs. Pennycook sniffed. "Well, then, I suppose Mr. Tillingham, of the Universal Church--"

Donna interrupted. "Mamma always knew she would be taken from me without warning, and she often
told me not to give her an expensive funeral. I think she would have liked some services but
I can't afford them."

"But, dearie, that's so barbarous like!" exclaimed the dismayed Samaritan. "There ought to
be some one to say some prayers an' sing a hymn or two."

"Mamma always said she wanted to be buried simply. She thought it was sweet and beautiful to
have services, but not essential. She was always skimping and saving for me, Mrs. Pennycook.
She said I wasn't to wear mourning; that the--living needed more prayers than--the--dead. She--
she said that when she was gone God would be good to her and that--I-- she said I would need
all the money we had."

"A-a-h-h-h!" breathed Mrs. Pennycook. She understood now. What a baggage the girl was! How
heartless, begrudging her poor dead mother the poor comfort of a Christian burial, because
she wanted the money for herself! Privately Mrs. Pennycook prophesied a bad ending for Donnie
Corblay. She winked knowingly at her husband, then with truly feminine sarcasm:

"Well, at least, Donna, you'll have to buy a coffin an' a grave an' have the grave dug--"

"Sam Singer will attend to that. I'm going to bury mamma among the flowers at the end of our
garden. I'll have a nice plain coffin made in San Pasqual--"

"Oh!" Mrs. Pennycook trembled.

"Mamma always said," Donna continued, "that undertakers preyed on the dead and traded in human
grief, and for me not to engage one for her funeral. I'm going to do just what she told me
to do, Mrs. Pennycook."

"Quite right, Donnie, quite right" interjected Mr. Pennycook. He was an impulsive creature
and even under the hypnotic eye of Mrs. P. he sometimes broke out of bounds.

"Daniel! Come!"

Daniel! At the mention of his Christian name Mr. Pennycook quivered. He knew he was in for
it now, but he didn't care. It occurred to him that he might as well, to quote a homely proverb,
"be hanged for a sheep as a lamb." He had visited the Hat Ranch to tender aid and sympathy,
and despite the impending visitation of his wife's wrath he resolved to be reckless for once
and deliver the goods in bulk.

"Your poor mother was a sensible woman, Donnie girl," he told the orphan, "an' you're a dutiful
daughter to follow out her last wishes under these--er--deplorable circumstances--er--er--I
mean it's a terrible hard thing to lose your mother, Donnie, an'--damme, Donnie, I'm sorry.
'Pon my word, I'm sorry."

Mrs. Pennycook's lips moved, and while no sound issued therefrom, yet did Dan Pennycook, out
of his many years of marital submission, comprehend the unspoken sentence:

"Dan Pennycook, you're a fool!"

"Ya-a-h" growled Mr. Pennycook, thoroughly aroused now and striving to appear belligerent.
His wife silenced him with a look; then turned to Donna. She had a duty to perform. She was
a great woman for "principle" and the performance of what she conceived to be her duty. She
was a well-meaning but misguided person ordinarily, who loved a fight with her own family on
the broad general ground that it denoted firmness of character. Mrs. Pennycook was so long
on virtue and character herself that half her life was spent disposing of a portion of these
attributes to the less fortunate members of her household.

She entered now upon a calm yet stern discussion of the perfectly impossible proceeding of
making a private cemetery out of one's back yard; but Mr. Pennycook had recovered his poise
and decided that here was one of those rare occasions when it behooved him to declare himself--by
the way, a very rare proceeding with Mr. Pennycook, he being known in San Pasqual as the original
Mr. Henpeck.

"Mrs. Pennycook," he thundered, "you will please 'tend to your own business, ma'am. Donnie,
my dear, I'm goin' to wire Los Angeles an' order up a heap o' big red roses on 25--damme, Mrs.
Pennycook, what the devil are you lookin' at, ma'am?"

"Nothing" she retorted, although it is a fact that had she been Medusa a singularly life-like
replica of Dan Pennycook in concrete might have been produced, upon which the posterity of
San Pasqual might gaze and be warned of the dangers attendant upon mating with the Mrs. Pennycooks
of this world.

Donna commenced to cry. Mr. Pennycook's sympathy, albeit checked and moderated to a great extent
by the presence of his wife, was, nevertheless, the most genuine sample of that rare commodity
which she had received up to that moment. His action had been so--brave--so spontaneous--he
knew--he understood; Dan Pennycook had a soul. And besides he was going to wire for some red
roses--and O, how scarce were red roses in San Pasqual!

"O Mr. Pennycook, dear Mr. Pennycook" she wailed, and sought instant refuge on his honest breast.
She placed her arms around his neck and cried, and Mr. Pennycook cried also, until his single
Sunday handkerchief was used up--whereat he pleaded dumbly with his wife for her handkerchief--and
was refused. So, like some great blubbering boy, he used his fists, while Mrs. Pennycook looked
coldly on, working her lower lip and the tip of her nose, rabbit-fashion, for all the world
like one who, having anticipated a sniff of the spices of Araby, has detected instead a shocking
aroma of corned beef and cabbage.

It was a queer tableau, indeed; Donna weeping on Mr. Pennycook's breast, when every instinct
of her sex, even the vaguest acceptance of tradition and custom, dictated that she should have
wept on Mrs. Pennycook's breast. Mrs. Pennycook realized the incongruity of the situation and
was shrewd enough to attribute it to a strong aversion to her on the part of Donna Corblay.
She resolved to make them both pay for her humiliation--Dan, within the hour, Donna whenever
the opportunity should occur.

CHAPTER IV

When Donna and Mr. Pennycook had succeeded eventually in overcoming their emotions, the worthy
yardmaster and his wife took their departure. Mr. Pennycook was compelled to return to work
and something told him that Donna would be happier alone than with Mrs. Pennycook; hence he
made no objection to her leaving the Hat Ranch.

They had scarcely left when the man whom Sam Singer had consulted at the Silver Dollar saloon
earlier in the day appeared from the north angle of the adobe wall, where he had been lurking,
and dodged into the Hat Ranch enclosure. Donna was seated at the kitchen table, her face in
her hands, when he arrived. He could see her through the open half- window of the lean-to,
so he came to the window, thrust his head and shoulders in and coughed.

Donna raised her head and gazed into the face of the worst man in San Pasqual!

This peculiarly distinguished individual was Mr. Harley P. Hennage, the proprietor of a faro
game in the Silver Dollar saloon. He had an impassive, almost dull, face (accentuated, perhaps,
from much playing of poker in early life) which, at times, would light up with the shy smile
of a trustful child, revealing three magnificent golden upper teeth. He bore no more resemblance
to the popular conception of a western gambler than does a college professor to a coal passer.
Mr. Hennage lived in his shirtsleeves, paid cash and hated jewelry. He had never been known
to carry a derringer or a small, genteel, silver- plated revolver in his waist-coat pocket.
Neither did he appear in public with a bowie knife down his bootleg. Not being a Mexican, he
did not carry a knife, and besides he always wore congress gaiters. Owing to the fact that
he was a large florid sandy person, with a freckled bristly neck and a singularly direct fearless
manner of looking at his man with eyes that were small, sunken, baleful and rather piggy, the
exigencies of Mr. Hennage's profession had never even warranted recourse to his two most priceless
possessions--his hands. Yet, despite this fact, and the further fact that he had never accomplished
anything more reprehensible than staking his coin against that of his neighbor, Mr. Hennage
had acquired the reputation of being the worst man in San Pasqual. In the language of the country,
he was a hard hombre, for he looked it. When one gazed at Mr. Hennage he observed a human bulldog,
a man who would finish anything he started. Hence, he was credited with the ability and inclination
to do the most impossible things if given half an excuse. It is needless, therefore, to remark
that Mr. Hennage's depravity, like Mrs. Pennycook's virtue, partook more or less of the nature
of the surrounding country; that is to say, it was susceptible of development.

Most people in this queer world of ours harbor an impression that if you make friends with
a dog he will not bite you, and that lion tamers are enabled to accumulate gray hairs merely
by the exercise of nerve and the paralyzing influence of the human eye. Hence, when the worst
man in San Pasqual confronted Donna, she did not at once scream for Sam Singer, but looked
Mr. Hennage in the eye and quavered.

"Good morning, Mr. Hennage."

It was hard work continuing to look Mr. Hennage in the eye. To-day he looked more like a bulldog
than ever, for his eyes were red-lidded and watery.

Mr. Hennage nodded. He drew a silk handkerchief from his coat pocket and blew his nose with
a report like a pistol shot before he spoke.

"How's the kitty?" he demanded.

Donna glanced toward the store and about the kitchen wearily and replied.

"I don't know, Mr. Hennage. I guess she's around the house somewhere."

"The Lord love you" murmured the gambler. The hard lips lifted, the dull impassive face was
lit for an instant by the trustful childish smile, and through the glory of that infrequent
facial expression Harley P.'s three gold front teeth flashed like triple searchlights.

"I mean, Miss Corblay, have you any money?"

"Only a little bit, Mr. Hennage" Donna quavered. S, chance. Rock, high, and have filed of man before

Man has been beefed and time has been lost all years that i say for specimens.
 She reads and dreams much,
for only between the arrival and departure of trains is she kept busy. She sends for books
that would never find a sale in San Pasqual, and some day--ah! the glory of anticipation! she
is going to Los Angeles, where the event of her life is to take place. Going to be married?
No? No, indeed. She is going to a theater.

So much for an intimate description of our leading lady as she appears when the curtain rises.
But in all plays, whether in real life or on the stage, there must be a leading man. Very well,
be patient. In due course he will appear. Donna has been dreaming much of this hero of late.
His name is Gerald Van Alstyne, and he is tall, with curly golden hair, piercing blue eyes
and a cleft chin; in short, a veritable Adonis and different, so different, from the traveling
salesmen who leer at her across the counter and the loutish youths of San Pasqual who, despairing
of her favor, call her by her first name because they know it annoys her. Donna has not the
slightest doubt but that this young fellow will come rushing in to the eating-house some day,
discover her when he comes to pay his check, and eventually return and keep on returning until
that final happy day when they shall go away together, to walk hand in hand through green fields
and listen to the birds and bees, to linger under the shade of green trees, to wander in an
Elysium. She does not know what green fields and running water look like, but she has read
about them--

The director's whistle is heard in the wings; the play is on at last!

As Donna thrust the last hatpin through her glorious hair and turned to leave the place of
her employment, her glance rested upon Mr. Harley P. Hennage, covertly watching her over the
edge of his soup spoon. She removed her glove, walked around the end of the lunch counter and
held out her hand.

"Well, Mr. Hennage. This is a delightful surprise. I'm so glad to see you back in San Pasqual.
Where have you been these past three years?"

Harley P. scrambled down from his high stool, took her cool hand and blushed.

"I wouldn't like to tell you," he said, "but I've been in some mighty- y-y funn-y-y places,
where I didn't meet no beautiful young ladies like you, Miss Donnie. I ain't much of a man
at handin' out compliments--I never was one o' the presumin' kind--but you sure do put San
Pasqual on the map. Miss Donnie, you do, for a fact."

Donna smiled her appreciation of Harley P.'s gallantry. "You left without saying good-by" she
reminded him. "If I had needed you I couldn't have found you. Do you remember? You said if
I ever needed a friend--"

The big gambler grinned. "You never needed me, Miss Donnie. You never would need a man like
me, but you might have needed money. If you'd a- needed money, now, why, Dan Pennycook he'd
a-seen you through."

Mr. Hennage did not judge it necessary to tell Donna that he had left the worthy yardmaster
in charge of her destinies, with a thousand dollars on deposit in a bank in Bakersfield, in
Dan's name, for Donna's use in case of emergency. Mr. Hennage lived in an atmosphere of money,
where everybody fought to get his money away from him and where he fought to get theirs; hence
finances were ever his first thought. As for Donna, she did not think it necessary that she
should express a contrary opinion regarding Dan Pennycook. She said:

"Why didn't you come to the counter at once and say hello?"

He shook his head, "I wanted to all right, but I hated to appear presumin', an' with my rep
in this village you know how people are liable to talk. World treatin' you well, Miss Donnie?"

"I think I get more fun out of San Pasqual than most of the people in it."

"Well, then, you must spend a lot o' time lookin' into a mirror" replied Harley P., and blushed
at his effrontery. "That's the only way the San Pasqual folks can get any fun--a-lookin' at
your face."

"Mr. Hennage, I fear you're getting to be one of the presuming kind. I declare I haven't had
such pretty speeches made me this year. By the way, how's the kitty?"

Harley P.'s russet countenance swelled like the wattles on a Thanksgiving turkey. He leaned
over the counter and gazed under it; his glance swept the room; he even, peered under his stool.
Finally he looked up at Donna with his three gold teeth flashing through his trustful, childish
smile.

"I dunno" he answered. "I guess she's around the house somewheres. I ain't seen her in quite
a spell."

"I thought so," she answered gravely, "or you wouldn't have returned to San Pasqual. Small
game for a small pocketbook, eh, Mr. Hennage?" She came closer to him. "I don't mind telling
you--just between friends, you understand--that I have a couple of hundred to stake you to
if you're hard up, but for goodness sake don't tell Mrs. Pennycook. She talks."

"Good Lord" gasped the gambler, and choked on a crouton. "D'ye mean it, Miss Donna?"

"Certainly."

"You're a dead game sport and I'd take you up, because I understand that it's between pals,
but you ain't got no notion o' tryin' to square me for--you know!"

"I might--if I didn't understand all about that--you know? As it is I want to show you that
I'm grateful, and my experienced eye informs me that you arrived in a box car. An empty furniture
car, I should say, judging by that scrap of excelsior in your back hair, although the car might
have been loaded with crockery."

Mr. Hennage removed the evidence and gazed at it reflectively.

"I suppose, now, if that'd been a feather, you'd a-swore I flew in."

"Possibly. You've been a high flyer in your day, haven't you?"

Mr. Hennage grinned. "I've flew some, but I've come home to roost now. How's the old savage
down at the Hat Ranch?"

"Sam Singer is unchanged. Nothing ever changes in this country, Mr. Hennage."

"Nothin' but money," he corrected, as he fished a bill out of his vest pocket, "an' money sure
changes hands, more particular when I'm around."

"Are you going back to the Silver Dollar saloon?"

"Yes, I suppose so."

"Faro, roulette, black jack, coon can or craps?"

"The old game--faro."

"I'll bank you up to five hundred."

"That's not the right thing for a young lady to do, is it?" queried the gambler. "Havin' truck
wit' my kind o' people. Me--I'll do anything, but a young lady, now--"

"Please do not compare me with Mrs. Pennycook" Donna pleaded. "I am not the guardian of San
Pasqual's morals. ***** the i is my valley, hundred.

"I guess that's the explanation" she confessed, the while she marveled inwardly that she should
feel such relief at unburdening her secret to the worst man in San Pasqual.

"If some good woman had only done that for me" the gambler murmured a little wistfully. "If
she only had! But of course this young Bob, he's different from--what I was at his age--"

"I couldn't help it" Donna sobbed; "he's one of the presuming kind."

Harley P. sat down and laughed until his three gold teeth almost threatened to fall out.

"God bless your sweet soul, Miss Donna," he gasped, "go in and kiss him again! He needs you
worse than he does a nurse. Go in an' kiss the presumin' cuss."

"You're making fun of me" Donna charged.

"I'm not. Can't a low-down, no-account man like me even laugh where there's happiness? Why,
if that young feller goes to work an' spoils it all by kickin' the bucket, I'd die o' grief."

"You know him, do you not?"

"I should say so."

"Is he--"

"Yes, he's the nicest kind of a boy."

"How old is he!"

"Twenty-eight."

Donna was thoughtful.

"Nice disparity in ages, don't you think, Miss Donna?"

Donna blushed again. "What is his business!" she asked.

"Well, that's a right hard question to answer, Miss Donna. He was a lawyer once for about a
month, after he got out o' college, an' then he worked on a newspaper. After that, just to
prove he was a human bein', he got the notion that there was money in the chicken business.
Well, he got out o' the chicken business with a couple o' hundred dollars, an' then he come
breezin' into a minin' camp one day an' tried bustin' a faro bank. Failed agin. I'm responsible
for that failure, though. The next I see of him is a year later, in McKittrick, where he's
runnin' a real estate office an' dealin' in oil lands. But somehow there never was no oil on
none o' the land that Bob tied up, so he got plumb disgusted an' quit. He was thinkin' o' tourin'
the country districts sellin' little pieces o' bluestone to put in the bowls of kerosene lamps
to keep 'em from explodin', when I see him next. He borrowed fifty dollars from me--which he
ain't paid back yet, come to think on't --an' went to Nevada minin' an' just at present he's
about settled into his regular legitimate business. He was headed that way from birth. I could
read the signs."

"What is his present profession?"

"He's an Inspector o' Landscapes."

"You're wrong. He's not a Desert Rat."

"He is. I can prove it."

"He's too young. They don't begin to 'rat' until they're close to forty. I could name you a
dozen, and the youngest is thirty-eight."

"Oh, you're thinkin' o' the ordinary, garden variety. But I tell you this McGraw man's a Desert
Rat. The desert's got him. Generally it don't get 'em so young, but once in a while it does,
An' of all the Desert Rats that ever sucked a niggerhead cactus, the feller that goes huntin'
lost mines is the worst. They never get over it."

Donna permitted herself a very small smile.

"Sometimes they do" she reminded him.

"I wouldn't be surprised. But not until they've found what they're lookin' for. However, we'll
wait an' see if Bob McGraw--like that name, Miss Donna?"

"I love it."

"We'll wait an' see if he pulls through this, an' then we'll find out if he can be cured o'
desert-rattin'. In the meantime I'll wait here until Doc gets back. I ain't one of the presumin'
kind, but I think I'd better stay. An' you--I think you'd better go in an' have another good
look at this Desert Rat o' yours. He's breathin' like the north wind sighin' through a knot-hole."

He watched her disappear.

"For the sight o' a good woman, O Lord, we thank Thee," he murmured, "an' for the sight o'
a good woman with grit, we thank Thee some more. Great grief, why wasn't I born good an' good-lookin'
'stead o' fat an' no account?"

At ten o'clock Doc Taylor returned to the Hat Ranch and found the condition of his patient
unchanged. He was still unconscious and his loud, stertorous breathing, coupled with the ghastly
exhaust of air through the hole on his breast, testified to the seriousness of his condition.
Throughout the night Donna sat by the bedside watching him, while the doctor remained in the
kitchen with Mr. Hennage.

Toward morning Bob McGraw opened his eyes and looked at Donna very wonderingly. Then his glance
wandered around the room and back to the girl. He was plainly puzzled.

"Where's my horse," he whispered, "and my spurs and my gun and hat?"

Donna bent over him and placed two cool fingers on his lips.

"The hemorrhage has stopped," she warned him, "and you mustn't speak or move, or you may bring
it on again."

"I remember--now. I fired--low--and he--got me. Where's Friar Tuck?"

"Your horse? He's in the corral at San Pasqual, and your gun is in the kitchen with your spurs,
and your hat--why, I guess I forgot to bring your hat with me. But don't worry about it. I'm
Donna Corblay of the Hat Ranch, and I'll give you your choice of a hundred hats if you'll only
get well."

"Are you--the--girl--that kissed me?"

Donna's voice was very low, her face was very close to his as she answered him. His lean brown
hand stole confidingly into hers--for a long time he was silent, content to lie there and know
that she was near him.

Presently he looked up at her again, with the same dominating, wistful entreaty in his brown
eyes. She lowered her head until her cheek rested against his, and his arm went upward and
around her neck.

"God--made you--for me" he whispered. "I love you, and my name is Bob McGraw. I guess--I'll--get
well."

"Beloved," she breathed, "of course you'll get well. I want you to." She smoothed the wavy
auburn hair back from his forehead. "Go to sleep" she commanded. "You can't talk to me any
more. I'm going to go to sleep, too."

She drew a bright Mexican serape over her shoulders, sat down in a rocking-chair by the side
of the bed and closed her eyes. For what seemed to her a lapse of hours, although in reality
it was less than five minutes, she tried to induce a clever counterfeit of sleep, but unable
longer to deprive herself of another look at her prize she opened her eyes and gazed at Bob
McGraw. To her almost childish delight he was watching her; and then she noticed his little,
cheerful, half- mocking smile.

She flushed hotly. For the first time she permitted the searchlight of reason to play on the
events of the night, and it occurred to her now that she had been guilty of a monstrous breach
of convention, an unprecedented, unmaidenly action. She felt like crying now, with the thought
that she had held herself so cheap. Bob McGraw saw the flush and the pallor that followed it.
He read the unspoken thought behind the changing rush of color.

"Don't feel--that way--about it" he whispered haltingly. "It's unusual --but then--you and
I are unusual, too. There seems to be--perfect-- understanding, and between a--man and a woman
that means--perfect peace. It had to--be. It was preordained--our meeting. What is--your name?"

Donna again told him.

"Nice--name. Like it."

He closed his eyes and dropped off to sleep like a tired boy.

CHAPTER VI

Donna sat there until sunrise, rocking back and forth, striving to weave an orderly pattern
of reason out of the tangle of unreason in which she found herself when, confronted by that
look in Bob McGraw's brown eyes. She failed. She could not think calmly. She was conscious
of but one supreme emotion as she gazed at this man who had ridden into her life, gun in hand.
She was happy. Heretofore her life had been quiet, even, unemotional, always the same--and
now she was happy, riotously, deliriously happy; and it did not occur to her that Bob McGraw
might die. She willed that he should live, for life was love, and love--what was love? Something
that surged, a wave of exquisite tenderness, through Donna's lonely heart, something that throbbed
in the untouched recesses of her womanhood, arousing in her a fierce, almost primitive desire
to possess this man, to fondle his auburn head, to caress him, to work for him, slave for him,
to show her gratitude and adoration by living for him, and--if need be--by dying for him!

It occurred to her presently that there was nothing so very unmaidenly in her action, after
all. She felt no distinct loss of womanly reserve --no crumbling of the foundations of dignity.
She still had those attributes; to-morrow, when she returned to the cashier's counter at the
eating-house, she would still have these defensive weapons against the invasions of the sensual,
smirking, patronizing male brutes with which every passing train appeared to be filled; the
well-dressed, hard-finished city men, who held her cheap because she presided behind an eating-house
cash-register. How well she knew their quick, bold stares, their so clumsy subterfuges to enter
into conversation with her; and how different was Bob McGraw to such as they!

Here at last was the reason, unseen and unrecognized at first, manifesting itself merely in
the spontaneous and unconscious shattering of her maidenly reserve, but distinctly visible
now. It was not that Bob McGraw had come to her out of the desert at a time when she needed
him most; it was not that he came in all the bravery and generous sacrifice of youth, shedding
his blood that she might not shed tears; it was not the service he had rendered her that made
her love him, for San Pasqual was "long" on mere animal courage. It was the adoration that
gleamed in his eyes--an adoring stare, revealing respect behind his love--that one quality
without which love is a dead and withered thing.

She knew him now--the man he was. She saw the priceless pearl of character he possessed. Bob
McGraw was a wild, reckless, unthinking, impulsive fellow, perhaps, but for all that he was
the sort of man at whose feet women, both good and bad, have laid their hearts since the world
began. He was kind. Harley P. Hennage was right. Bob McGraw was a Desert Rat. But a Desert
Rat lives close to the great heart of Mother Nature, and his own heart is clean.

The dawn-light came filtering across the desert and lit up the room where she sat. She turned
to the bed and saw that Bob McGraw was watching her again, and on his face was that little,
cheerful, mocking, inscrutable smile.

Again Donna found herself powerless to resist the appeal in the man's eyes. She was crying
a little as she slipped to her knees beside the bed and laid her cheek against his.

"I can't help it" she whispered. "I seem to have loved you always, and oh, Bob, dear, you'll
be very, very good to me, won't you? You must be brave and try to get well, for both our sakes.
We need each other so."

Bob McGraw did not answer readily. He was too busy thanking God for the great gift of perfect
understanding. Moreover, he had a perforated lung and a heart whose duties had suddenly been
increased a thousand-fold, if it was to hold inviolate this sacred joy of possession which
thrilled him now. He was alert and conscious, despite the shock of his wound, and the reserve
strength in his six feet of splendid manhood was coming to his aid. When he could trust himself
to speak, he said:

"You're a very wonderful woman."

"But you were laughing at me--a little."

"Not at you, at Fate--the great, big, bugaboo Fate."

"Why?"

"Because I--can afford to. My luck's--turned."

"You dear, big, red-headed philosopher."

"And you--didn't you save my hat?"

"No, dear. Don't worry over such a trifle as a hat. I'll give you a--"

"But this was--a--good hat" he complained. "I paid twenty dollars--"

"Never mind your old hat. Don't talk. I'm selfish. I want to listen to you, but for all that,
you must be quiet."

He sighed. Forget all about that big, wide sombrero--genuine beaver-- that cost him twenty
dollars only a week ago? His horse, his saddle, his hat, his spurs, his gun--he was particular
about these possessions, for in his way Mr. McGraw was something of a frontier dandy. His calm
contempt of life and death amused Donna when she compared it with his boyish concern for his
dashing equipment. Hats, indeed! Worrying over a lost hat while a guest at the Hat Ranch! Rourke’

 He sprang out of bed and unlocked the door, and
Dan Pennycook came into the room.

"Hello, Dan" the gambler greeted him. "You look worried."

"You would too, if you knew what I know" replied Pennycook. He sat down. "Harley, old man,
you've laid violent hands on a mighty hard character."

"Well," retorted the gambler, "ain't that the kind to lay violent hands on? You wouldn't expect
me to choke old Judge Kenny, or that little Jap laundryman, would you?"

"But O'Rourke is dangerous. He's got two guns reachin' down to his hocks an' he's tellin' everybody
he'll get you on sight."

"Barkin' dogs never bite, Dan. However, I wish you'd carry a message for me. Will you?"

"Who to?"

"The dangerous Mr. O'Rourke. Tell him from me he'd better go back to the borax works at Keeler,
where he got his nickname, an' take up his old job o' skinnin' mules. Tell him I'll loan him
that roan pony in the corral, an' he can saddle up an' git. Tell him to send the little horse
back with the stage-driver. I want him to ride out tonight, Dan. Tell him it's an order."

Pennycook nodded. "If I was you, though, Harley, I'd heel myself."

The gambler opened a bureau drawer and brought forth McGraw's automatic pistol. He smiled brightly.

"No use givin' orders unless a feller can back 'em up, Dan" he said. "Thanks for the hint,
though. Of course you'll tell Borax privately. No use arousin' his pride lettin' the whole
town know he had to go. He's a rat, but a rat'll fight when he's cornered--an' I don't want
to kill him."

"I will" replied Mr. Pennycook. "I'd hate to see any more trouble in this town."

"Thank you, Dan."

"Donna all right?"

"Yes."

"Who's the feller that interfered?"

"Stranger ridin' through."

"Hard hit?"

"Right lung. He'll pull through."

"Hope so" responded the amiable yardmaster, and left. Mr. Hennage got back into bed and pulled
the sheet over him again. But it was too hot to sleep, so he lay there, rubbing his chin and
thinking. Late in the afternoon he heard the sound of a horse loping through the street beneath
his window. He sprang up and looked out, just in time to see Borax O'Rourke riding out of town
on Bob McGraw's roan bronco.

Mr. Hennage permitted himself a quiet little smile. "Now there goes the star witness for the
prosecution" he mused. "But I'll stay an' tell 'em Borax was mistaken. I guess, even if I ain't
a gentleman, I can lie like one."

He bathed and dressed and started over to the post-office--not because he expected any mail,
for he did not. No one ever wrote to Mr. Hennage. But he had seen Mrs. Pennycook dodging into
the post-office, and it was his intention to have a quiet little conversation with the lady.

When he arrived at the post-office, however, Mrs. Pennycook was not in sight. Mr. Hennage stepped
lightly inside, and at that moment he heard Miss Molly Pickett, the postmistress, exclaim:
"Well, for the land's sake!"

"It's a fact, Miss Pickett. She kissed him!"

The voices came from the inner office, behind the tier of lock boxes. Realizing that he was
in a public place, Mr. Hennage did not feel it incumbent upon him to announce his presence
by coughing or shuffling his feet. He remained discreetly silent, therefore, and Mrs. Pennycook's
voice resumed:

"She had him taken right down to the Hat Ranch, of all places. Of course it wouldn't do to
bring him up town, where he could be looked after. Of course not! He might be sent to a hospital
and she wouldn't have a chance to look after him herself. I never heard of such carryings-on,
Miss Pickett. It's so scandalous like."

Miss Pickett sighed. "Who is he?" she demanded.

"That's what nobody can find out. I told Dan to ask Harley Hennage, but you know how stupid
a man is. I don't suppose he even asked."

"Well, all I've got to say, Mrs. Pennycook, is that Donna Corblay's taking a mighty big interest
in a man she's never even been introduced to. Still, I'm not surprised at anything she'd do,
the stuck-up thing. She just thinks she's it, with her new hats and a different wash-dress
every week, and her high an' mighty way of looking at people. She could have been married long
ago if she wasn't so stuck-up."

"Oh, nobody's good enough for her" sneered Mrs. Pennycook. "If a dook was to ask her she wouldn't
have him. She'd sooner make fools of half the married men in town."

"She thinks she's too good for San Pasqual" Miss Pickett supplemented.

"I suppose she imagines her grand airs make her a lady," Mrs. Pennycook deprecated, "but for
my part, I think it shows that she's kinder vulgar like."

"Well, what do you think o' last night's performance?" Miss Pickett demanded.

"I can't think, dearie" murmured Mrs. Pennycook weakly. "I'm so shocked like. It's hard to
believe. I know the girl for a sly, scheming, hoity- toity flirt, but to think that she'd act
so low like! Who told you she kissed him?"

"Borax O'Rourke."

"He told everybody."

"Well, then, if it's got around, public like, we can't shield her, Miss Pickett, an' I guess
it's no use trying. Water will seek its own level, Miss Pickett. You remember her mother. Nobody
ever knew a thing about her, an' you remember the talk that used to be goin' around about her."

"The tree grows as the twig is bent" Miss Pickett murmured.

"I'll say this much, though, Miss Pickett" continued Mrs. Pennycook. "You're a woman an' so'm
I, an' you know, just as well as I do, that no man or set o' men ever looks twice at any respectable
woman that goes right along tendin' to her business. You know that, Miss Pickett. A man's got
to have some encouragement."

"Well" Miss Pickett was forced to remark. "I've been postmistress an' assistant postmistress
here for fifteen years, an' nobody's ever insulted me, or tried to flirt with me. I can take
my oath on that."

"I believe you, Miss Pickett" interrupted Harley P. Hennage serenely. "Even in a tough town
like San Pasqual human courage has its limitations."

Miss Pickett flew to the delivery window and looked out. Harley P. was looking in.

"Is that so!" sneered Miss Pickett.

"Looks like it" retorted the gambler. "You're Exhibit A to prove it, ain't you, Miss Pickett?
I hope I see you well, Mrs. Pennycook" he added.

"So you're back, are you?" Mrs. Pennycook's voice dripped with sarcasm.

 The nurse was not lacking in a sense of humor, and readily
agreed to enlist under the banner of Harley P.

"An' remember," he warned her, as he prepared to leave, "to look sharp if you see a forty-five-year-old
damsel, with a little bright red face, all ears an' no chin, like the ace o' hearts. That'll
be Miss Pickett. She'll have with her, like as not, a stout married lady, all gab an' gizzard,
like a crow, an' a mouth like a new buttonhole. That'll be Mrs. Pennycook. Look out for 'em
both. They talk!"

And having played this unworthy trick on the gossips of San Pasqual, Mr. Hennage returned to
town in a singularly cheerful state of mind, and devoted the balance of the day to the duties
of his profession.

That night, when he went to his dinner at the eating-house, he stopped at the counter to have
a little chat with Donna.

"What luck?" he asked.

"I declare I'm almost exhausted. I've been dodging questions and tripping over hints all day long."

"Miss Pickett come over to offer sympathy."

"Yes."

"Hu-u-um! An' after she went away, I suppose Mrs. Pennycook come in as thick as three in a bed?"

"She was very nice."

"She'd better be" he remarked, and Donna thought that beneath the jocularity of his manner
she detected a menace.

"What have you heard?" she queried.

"I've heard," he replied deliberately, "that Donna Corblay is harboring a desperate character
in her home."

"I heard something else to-day. While we're gossiping, Mr. Hennage, I'll tell you the latest--the
very latest. It's reported that Dan Pennycook is drinking."

"No!" Mr. Hennage was concerned. He was fond of Dan Pennycook. "Who told you!" he inquired.

"He was seen buying a bottle of port wine in the Silver Dollar saloon this afternoon, and you
know his wife is strictly temperance."

"Oh, shucks! There's nothin' to that report. I can account for that just as easy as lookin'
through a hoop. It's goin' to be wine jelly, after all. I thought maybe it might be calf's-foot,
but--" he broke off. "I wish," he said earnestly, "I could get hold of a low-spirited billy
goat, Miss Donna, an' tie him to your front gate when Mrs. P. arrives. You want to warn the
nurse, Miss Donna. Remember what the old sharp in the big book says: 'Beware o' the Greeks
when they come into camp with gifts.' Hey, Josephine!"

He hailed his waitress.

"About twenty-five dollars' worth o' ham an' eggs," he ordered, "with some pig's ear and cauliflower
on the side. I ain't had such a big appetite for my grub since I was a boy."

That evening, when Donna left the eating-house for her home, it seemed to her that the Hat
Ranch must be situated at least ten miles further from San Pasqual than it had been two days
previous. It almost seemed as if she would never reach the gate that pierced the big seven-foot
adobe wall which shut Bob McGraw in from the prying eyes of the townspeople; she felt that
her heart, over-burdened with its weight of agonized happiness, must break before she found
herself once more standing by Bob's bed, gazing down at him with a look of proprietorship and love.

As she stood there, smiling, her face flushed from the exertion of her rapid walk, her jaunty
straw hat casting little vagrant shadows across her great, dark, sparkling eyes, he awakened
and looked up. She was drawing off her gloves, and one who has ridden in the waste places as
much as had Bob McGraw soon learns that simple signs are sometimes pregnant of big things.
The big thing, as Bob read it then, was the fact that she had just come home; that she had
hurried, for she was breathing hard. Why had she hurried? Why, to see him, Bob McGraw--and
in such a hurry was she that she had not waited to remove her hat and gloves. This was all
very gratifying; so gratifying that Mr. McGraw would almost, at that moment, have welcomed
a .45 through his other lung, if thereby he could only make her understand how deeply gratified
he really was--how dearly he loved her and would continue to love her. He was so filled with
such thoughts as these that he continued to gaze at her in silence for fully a minute before
he spoke.

"It's been a long, hot day" he whispered. "I worried. Thought you might be kept--late--again."

The adorable old muggins! The very thought of having somebody to worry over her was so very
new to Donna, and so very sweet withal, that she called Mr. McGraw an adorable old muggins,
and pinched the lobe of his left ear, and tweaked the sunburned apex of his Irish nose. Then
she kissed the places thus pinched and tweaked, and declared that she was happy enough to--to--to
swear! "I understand--perfectly" said Bob McGraw, and there is no doubt that he did. The idea
of a glorious young Woman like Donna swearing was, indeed, perfectly ridiculous. Of course,
nerve-racked tired waitresses and be-deviled chefs "cussed each other out" as a regular thing
up at the eating-house during a rush, and Donna, having listened to these conversational sparks,
off and on, for three years, felt now, for the first time, as she imagined they must feel--that
the unusual commotion in one's soul occasionally demands some extraordinary outlet.

"I could beat Soft Wind with the broom, or tip over the stove, or do something equally desperate"
she told him. "I feel so deeply--it hurts me--here," and she pressed her hand to her heart.

"Think of me," he whispered, "hurt on--both sides. Bullet--hole in-- right lung--key-hole in--my
heart."

The blarney of the wretch! Really, this McGraw man was the most forward person! As if he could
ever, by any possibility, love her as she loved him!

"You great red angel" she said. Then she ruffled his hair and fled out to the kitchen to investigate
the exact nature of the savory concoction which the nurse was preparing for her invalid. No
royal chef, safe- guarding the stomach of his monarch against the surreptitious introduction
of a deadly poison in the soup, could have evinced a greater interest in the royal appetite
than did Donna in Bob McGraw's that night. As the nurse was about to take the bowl of broth
which she had prepared, in to her patient, Donna dipped up a small quantity on a teaspoon and
tasted it.

"A little more salt, I think" she announced, with all the gravity of her twenty years.

The nurse glanced at her for a moment, before she took her glowing face between her cool palms
and kissed the girl on each cheek. Then she reached for the salt cellar, dropped a small pinch
into the soup, seized the tray and marched out, smiling. She was one of the women on this earth
who can understand without asking--at least Donna thought so, and was grateful to her for it.

The three weeks that followed, while Bob McGraw, having battled his way through the attack
of traumatic pneumonia incident to the wound in his lungs, slowly got back his strength, seemed,
indeed, the most marvelous period of Donna Corblay's entire existence. On the morning after
her conversation with Harley P., Mrs. Pennycook, true to the gambler's prediction, did favor
the Hat Ranch with her bustling presence, and wrapped in a snow-white napkin the said Mrs.
Pennycook did carry the hereinbefore mentioned glass of wine jelly for the debilitated stranger
in their midst. Donna was at the eating-house when Mrs. Pennycook called, but the nurse received
her--not, however, without an inward chuckle as she recalled Mr. Hennage's warning and discovered
that Mrs. Pennycook's mouth did really resemble a new buttonhole--as the mouth of every respectable,
self-righteous, provincial female bigot has had a habit of resembling even as far back as the
days of the Salem witchcraft.

For her wine jelly, Mrs. Pennycook received due and courteous thanks from the nurse personally,
and also on behalf of Miss Corblay and the patient. To her apparently irrelevant and impersonal
queries, regarding the identity of the wounded man, his personal and family history, Mrs. Pennycook
received equally irrelevant and impersonal replies, and when she suggested at length that she
"would dearly love to see him for a moment--only a moment, mind you--to thank him for what
he had done for that dear sweet girl, Donna Corblay," the nurse found instant defense from
the invasions by reminding Mrs. Pennycook of the doctor's orders that his patient be permitted
to remain undisturbed.

Two days later Mrs. Pennycook, accompanied by Miss Pickett, called again. Miss Pickett carried
the limp carcass of a juvenile chicken, and armed with this passport to Bob McGraw's heart
and confidence, she too, endeavored to run the guard. Alas! The young man was still in a very
precarious condition, and baffled and discouraged, the charitable pair departed in profound
disgust.

The next day Dan Pennycook called, at Mrs. Pennycook's orders. The yardmaster, as he bowed
to the nurse and ventured a mild inquiry as to the patient's health, presented a remarkable
imitation of a heretofore conscientious dog that has just been discovered in the act of killing
a sheep. Poor Daniel was easy prey for the efficient nurse. He retired, chop-fallen and ashamed,
and the day following, two conductor's wives and the sister of a brakeman, armed respectively
with a brace of quail, a bouquet of assorted sweet peas and half a dozen oranges, came, deposited
their offerings, were duly thanked and dismissed.

To all these interested ladies, Donna, at the suggestion of Harley P. (who, by the way, fell
heir to the brace of quail, which he had prepared by the eating-house chef, and later consumed
with great gusto), wrote a polite note of thanks. This, of course merely served to irritate
an already irritated community, without affording them an opportunity for what Mr. Hennage
termed "a social comeback." He contracted the habit, during that first week, of coming in to
his dinner earlier, in order that he might hear from Donna a detailed report of the frantic
efforts of her neighbors to get at the bottom of the mystery. Mr. Hennage was enjoying himself
immensely.

After the first week had passed without developments, interest in Donna and her affairs began
to dwindle, for not infrequently matters move in kaleidoscopic fashion in San Pasqual, and
the population, generally speaking, soon finds itself absorbed in other and more important
matters. Mrs. Pennycook was quick to note that Donna (to quote Mr. Hennage) was "next to her
game," and with the gambler's threat hanging over her she was careful to refrain from expressing
any decided opinions in the little circle in which she moved.

At the end of the second week the news that development work was projected somewhere near the
town, doubtless by some syndicate whose operations were so extensive that the work would likely
mean a construction camp conveniently near, swept the Bob McGraw-Donna Corblay episode completely
aside. Rumor, fanned by the eager desires of the business element of the hamlet, gained headway,
despite the fact that false rumor was all too frequent a visitor to San Pasqual, until not
more than half a dozen people in the town remembered that Donna Corblay had had an adventure,
the details of which they had failed to unearth.

During those three weeks of convalescence, Bob McGraw's splendid condition, due to his clean
and hardy life on the range and desert, caused him to rally with surprising rapidity from his
dangerous wound. At the end of ten days he was permitted to sit up in bed and talk freely,
and a few days later with the assistance of the nurse and Sam Singer he was lifted into a chair
and spent a glorious day sitting in the sun in the wind-protected patio. The slight cough which
had troubled him at first commenced to disappear, proving that the wound was healing from within,
and the doctor announced that at the end of a month Bob would be able to leave the house.

As the reader may have had cause to suspect earlier in this recital, Bob McGraw was not the
young man to permit the grass to sprout under his feet in the matter of a courtship. The brief
period each evening which he and Donna spent together served to convince each that life without
the other would not be worth the living. Their wooing was dignified and purposeful; their love
was too pure and deep to be taken lightly or tinged with the frivolity that too often accompanies
an ardent love affair between two young people who have not learned, as had Bob and Donna,
to view life seriously. Again when he squeal i have a trail of them saw when he was after world, and

The hint of the desert sadness died out in the girl's eyes as he declaimed his gospel.

"Oh," she cried softly, "that's beautiful--beautiful."

"That's the Litany of a Pagan, Donna," he answered. "One has to believe to understand when
he goes to church in a city, but if you're a Pagan like me, you only have to understand in
order to believe."

"I am," she interrupted passionately, "I'm a Pagan and the daughter of a Pagan. My father was
a Sun Worshiper--like you."

"Tell me about yourself and your people," he said, and Donna told him the story with which
the reader is already familiar. He questioned her carefully about Sam Singer and the man who
had murdered her father and despoiled him of his fortune.

"Who was this tenderfoot person?" he asked. "Didn't Sam Singer know his name?"

"No. We never knew the man's name. When my father left for the desert he merely told mother
that he was going to meet an Eastern capitalist at Salton. Sam says the only name my father
called the man was Boston."

"Boston?"

Donna nodded.

"That means he hailed from Boston, and your father called him that in sheer contempt. No wonder
they fought."

He was silent, thinking over that strange tale of a lost mine which Sam Singer had told Donna's
mother.

"Well, I'm not going to keep on desert ratting until somebody cracks me on the head and stows
me on the shelf" he said presently.

He waved his arm toward the north. "Away up there, a hundred and fifty miles, I've cast my
fortune--in the desert of Owens river valley. I've cut out for myself a job that will last
me all my life, and win or lose, I'll fight the fight to a finish. I'm going to make thirty-two
thousand acres of barren waste bloom and furnish clean, unsullied wealth for a few thousand
poor, crushed devils that have been slaughtered and maimed under the Juggernaut of our Christian
civilization. I'm going to plant them on ten-acre farms up there under the shadow of old Mt.
Kearsarge, and convert them into Pagans. I'm going to create an Eden out of an abandoned Hell.
I'm going to lay out a townsite and men will build me a town, so I can light it with my own
electricity. It's a big Utopian dream, Donna dear, but what a crowning glory to the dreamer's
life if it only comes true! Just think, Donna. A few thousand of the poor and lowly and hopeless
brought out of the cities and given land and a chance for life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness; to know that their toil will bring them some return, that they can have a home and
a hope for the future.

He paused, a little flushed and exalted. Never before had Bob McGraw unburdened his heart of
its innermost secrets, its hopes, its fears, its aspirations; for a moment now he almost quivered
at the thought that Donna would look upon him as a dreamer, an idealist--perhaps a fool--he,
a penniless desert wanderer assuming to hold in his sunburnt palm the destinies of the under
dogs of civilization--the cripples too weak and hopeless to be anything more than wretched
camp-followers in the Army of Labor.

He glanced down at her now, half expecting, dreading to meet, the look of gentle indulgence
so common to the Unbeliever. But there was no patronizing smile, no tolerant note in her voice
as she asked simply:

"And this great, beautiful Utopia of yours, Bob--what did you call it?"

"It doesn't exist yet," he explained hastily, "but it--it may. And when it does become a reality,
I'm going to call it Donnaville."

"Why?"

 The lower portion
of the valley, including the stretch of desert on which I had my eye, was suddenly withdrawn
from entry and thrown into a Forest Reserve by the Department of the Interior. It was a queer
proceeding that--including a desert timbered with sage-brush and greasewood in a Forest Reserve.
Withdrawing from entry lands that would not even remotely interest settlers!

"I thought this over a great deal, and by and by I began to see the light. I had suspected
from observation and personal experience that there was a powerful private influence at work
in the state land office, and by reason of their seeming control of the office were engaged
in looting the state of its school lands which were timbered. In the congressional investigation
into certain land frauds in California, it was discovered that the men accused of the frauds
had been aided by corrupt minor officials in the General Land Office-- clerks and chiefs of
certain bureaus, whom the land-grabbers kept on their private pay-rolls. This was a matter
of public record. Fortunately for the government, however, it has generally managed to secure
for the head of the Land Department able and incorruptible men to whom no taint of suspicion
attached--men whom the land-grabbers dare not attempt to corrupt.

"At the outset, I strongly suspected that the corrupt influence, which presumably had been
exposed and punished in former investigations, was nevertheless still at work. The suspicion
that grossly erroneous reports, intentionally furnished the General Land Office by officials
of the Forestry Department in California, was responsible for the inclusion of the desert in
the Forest Reserve, strengthened into belief the more I thought it over. I thought I could
detect in this hoodwinking of the Department of the Interior, through the agency of some local
official, who had been 'reached' by the land ring, the first move in a well-planned raid on
the public domain, through the state land office.

"I quietly investigated the surveyor-general of the state, who is also ex-officio Registrar
of the State Land Office. I discovered that he was a man of unimpeachable public and private
life. I discovered also that he was in ill health, and had been during the greater portion
of his tenure in office; that he rarely spent more than two hours each day in his office; that
frequently he was away from his office for a month at a time, ill, and that the office practically
was dominated by his deputy. The surveyor-general was a quiet, easy-going man, advanced in
years and inclined to take things easy, and the upshot of my investigations confirmed me in
the belief that he was taking things easy--too easy--and that his wide-awake deputy was doing
business with the land ring, by virtue of his unhampered control of the office and the implicit
confidence reposed in him by the surveyor-general.

"There could be but two reasons for this ridiculous action by the Department of the Interior
in thus including a desert in a Forest Reserve. Either an error had been made by the local
forestry officials in defining the boundaries of the reserve, and thus reporting to the General
Land Office, or the job was intentional. If the former, the error would be discovered and the
boundaries rectified.

"Well, a year passed and the boundaries were not rectified, despite the fact that I wrote half
a dozen complaining letters to the General Land Office. The answer was easy. The land-grabbers
had subsidized somebody and my letters never got to headquarters. So I knew a big job was about
to be pulled off. I guessed that the land-grabbers had solved the water problem further up
the valley and were scheming to get control of the lower valley and lead the water to it, and
while developing their water supply they wanted the land denied to the public. There was always
the chance that some smart nester would come, file on a half-section and start boring artesian
wells. If he struck water, the news would travel and other settlers would come in and take
a chance, and before long there might be a hundred settlers in there. There would be no reason
to fear that they would stay forever, unless they got a big artesian flow on every forty acres,
and knew they could get water in sufficient quantity. But they would have found water and it
would have taken say three years for them to discover that their claims could not support them,
Nesters are a dogged breed of human. It takes a nester a long time to wake up to the fact that
he's licked, and until they woke up, the nesters would be liable to block the water wheels
of a private reclamation scheme.

"Then, too, if it should become bruited abroad, while the valley was open for entry, that water
for irrigation was being developed up the valley, settlers could have flocked in down the valley--and
waited for the water. A nester is patient. His life is spent in waiting. Under the desert land
laws one can file on three hundred and twenty acres, or a half-section, pay twenty-five cents
per acre down and then wait four years before being compelled to file with the land office
the proof of reclamation that will entitle him to final patent to his land. The land ring,
of course, knew this, and by their corrupt influence had so maneuvered to hoodwink the General
Land Office that the valley had been withdrawn from entry. When they had protected themselves
from prospective settlers, it would be safe for them to develop their water away up the valley.
When they were ready, it would be easy enough, to suddenly discover that a desert valley had,
by some stupid error, been included in a Forest Reserve, the boundaries would be readjusted
immediately, the valley once more thrown open for entry and--dummy entrymen, Johnny-on-the-spot,
to file on the land for the water company! Within the statutory limit of four years the water
company would have had time to extend its canals and laterals, the dummy entrymen would have
been able to show proof of reclamation and secure their patents, and after waiting a year,
perhaps to preserve appearances, they would, for a consideration, gradually transfer their
holdings to the water company, Within five years, the water company would have owned the entire
valley, would have reorganized, called themselves a land and irrigation company and gone into
the real estate business, selling five to twenty acre farms, with a perpetual water right,
at prices ranging from three to five hundred dollars per acre.

"I didn't, of course, know who was behind the game, but I knew the rules by which it would
be played. I'm more or less of a mining engineer, Donna, and it's part of a mining engineer's
business to know the laws relating to the public domain. I could see that unless I developed
water first and filed on the land first, I would never get my farm in the valley without paying
dearly to the thieves who had stolen from me my constitutional right to it.

"Hence, for the past two summers, Donna, I've been up in the Sierra looking for water. It seemed
to me that with so many mountain lakes up there below the snow-line, I must find one that I
could tap and bring the water down into my valley. If Nature made a mistake in the valley,
she would compensate for it up in the mountains, and I had an abiding faith that if I searched
long enough I'd find the water.

"I circled around mountain lakes where in all probability no human foot but mine had ever trod.
I crawled along the brink of a chasm three thousand feet deep, and crossed a glacier crevice
on a rawhide riata. I camped three nights on a peak with so much iron ore in it that when an
electrical storm came up it attracted the lightning and struck around me for hours. I crawled
and crept and climbed; I fell; I was cut and bruised and hungry and cold; but all the time
I was up there in the mountains I could look on the valley--my valley--and it was beautiful
and I didn't mind.

"A big thought that had been in the back of my brain for a long time came to me with renewed
force while I was up there in those Inyo Alps-- the thought that if I could find the water
it would be riches enough for me. But I wanted the land, too--not merely a half-section for
myself, but the whole valley--only I didn't want it for myself. It would only be mine in trust,
a sacred heritage that belonged to the lowly of the earth, and I wanted to save it for them.
I could see them all at that moment, the roustabouts, the laborers and muckers, the unskilled
toilers of the world. It was the hewers of wood and the drawers of water that I wanted that
valley to bloom for; the poor, poor devils whose only hope is the land that gave them birth
and life and would receive them in its bosom when they perished. Ten acres of that lonely thirsty
land, waiting there for me to reclaim it from the ruin of ages--ten acres of my desert valley
and some water and an equal chance--that's what I wanted for each of my fellow-Pagans, and
I made up my mind to get it for them from the robber-barons that planned to steal it.

"It comforted me a whole lot, that thought. It gave zest to the battle, and made the prize
seem worth fighting for. And I guess the God of a Square Deal was with me that day, for I found
the water. I discovered a lake a mile wide and nearly five miles long, fed by countless streams
from the melting snow on the peaks above. I walked around it, but I couldn't find any outlet,
and yet the lake never seemed to have risen higher than a certain point. This puzzled me until
I discovered a sandstone ledge half-way around its eastern edge, and through a gigantic crevice
in this sandstone the water escaped. When the lake rose to the edge of this crevice, during
the summer when the snow was melting up on the face of old Mount Kearsarge, the surplus flowed
off into some subterranean outlet, probably emerging at the head of some canyon miles away
on the other side of the range. This lake was hemmed in by hills, and between two of these
hills a canyon dropped away sheer to the desert two thousand feet below. I made careful estimates
and discovered that by shooting a tunnel three hundred feet through the country rock at the
head of this canyon I would come out on the other side of the place where the two hills met,
and pierce the lake below this sandstone crevice. I could drain the lake until the surface
of the water gradually came down to the intake, when I could put in a concrete pier with an
iron head-gate and regulate the flow. Even in winter when the lake was frozen over I would
have a steady flow of water, for my tunnel would tap the lake below the ice.

"Having found the water, my next move was to go down into the valley, into the great, hot,
panting hungry heart of Inyo to protect the land for my Pagans. At the land office in Independence
I registered my filing and turned to leave, just as a clerk came out and tacked a notice on
the bulletin board. I read it. It was the customary notice to settlers that the lower valley
had been withdrawn from the Forest Reserve and would be thrown open to entry at the expiration
of sixty days from date.

"I went to the feed corral, where I had kept Friar Tuck all summer, while I was up in the mountains.
I paid my livery bill, threw the saddle on Friar Tuck and headed south, for I knew that if
I was to turn robber baron and steal the valley for my Pagans I'd have to hustle. I got to
San Pasqual one night three weeks ago--and here I am."

Donna was silent. He is nearly for land.

.
 Armed with information respecting
the physical dimensions of Mr. McGraw, the gambler had attended to Bob's shopping, and upon
Donna's return to the Hat Ranch that night she discovered that during her absence a transformation
had taken place. Bob was arrayed in his new habiliments, and paraded up and down the patio
for the inspection of Donna and the nurse.

"Well, Donna" he called to her, "how do I look? Presentable? I know I'm feeling clean and respectable
again, at any rate, and I've asked Sam Singer to bury that ruin of rags I wore into town."

"Your gun hangs below the tail of your khaki coat."

"Then I'll tuck it up under my arm."

Donna helped him remove the coat, after which he buckled the belt over his right shoulder,
permitting the gun to hang securely in the holster under his left arm.

"Now, I don't look so confoundedly woolly and western" he said. "I do hate to go about looking
like the hero of a dime novel. I suppose if a tourist saw that gun hanging down he'd think
I was bloodthirsty. It would never occur to him that a gun comes in handy in the wilderness."

"Why not leave it here until your return?"

Bob grinned. "It's a good gun, Donna. I might be able to pawn it for enough to help out on
my return trip. Of course I have a watch, but its hockable value is negative. When I was very
young I was foolish enough to have my initials engraved on the case, but of course I know better
now--by George, Donna girl, I haven't any hat!"

She flashed him one of her rare wonderful smiles. "I was waiting for you to make that discovery"
she said. "You lost your hat the night you arrived in San Pasqual, but I haven't worried about
it. I've been saving a splendid big sombrero for you, Bob."

She went to her room, returning presently with a "cowboy" hat that must have been the joy and
pride of the tourist who sacrificed it to the San Pasqual zephyr. She pinched it to a peak
and set it jauntily on his auburn head, then stood off and surveyed him critically.

"It's a dear" she announced.

"Looks dear, too" he replied whimsically. "Must have cost the original owner a month's board.
Whew! That's a bird of a hat, Donna girl. Thank you. It's as good a hat as I'll ever own."

He sat down forthwith, turned back the sweat-band, moistened it slightly and with the stub
of an indelible pencil wrote his name in full. He had ridden range long enough to acquire the
habit of branding his property, and in that land of breeze and sunshine he knew the dangers
that beset a maverick hat.

That night they walked together in the patio for the last time. Neither felt inclined to conversation,
for the thoughts of each were occupied with dreams of the future, and the tragedy of that farewell
lay heavy upon them. Lover-like, each exacted from the other a promise to write every day,
and that important detail finally settled, Donna found it easy enough to be brave and let him go.

At eleven o'clock Sam Singer appeared in the patio to announce his willingness to trundle Bob
up to San Pasqual on the same trackwalker's velocipede upon which Bob had arrived at the Hat
Ranch. The nurse was not to leave until the next day, and being a discreet woman, and kindly
withal, she had had the delicacy to bid her patient farewell in the patio. Donna accompanied
him to the front gate, and there Bob with many a fervent promise to take good care of himself--and
not to forget to write every day, took her in his arms, kissed her quickly before the tears
should have a chance to rise, and was gone.

She watched him stride slowly through the gloom to the velocipede waiting on the tracks; she
saw him climb aboard. Then the Indian's body bent over the levers and the machine glided away
into the night. She stood at the gate and watched it until it vanished; she waited until Twenty-six
came thundering by at eleven-thirty-five and heard the grind of the brakes as the long train
pulled up at the station. Five minutes later she heard it pull out of San Pasqual, with many
a short and labored gasp, casting a lurid gleam across the desert as it sped northward into
Tehachapi Pass, carrying Bob McGraw forth to battle, to fight for his land and his Pagans.

When the last dim flicker of the green tail lights had disappeared Donna retired to her room
and cried herself to sleep. Once more she was left to battle alone with the world, and the
days would be long until Bob McGraw came back.

Three hours after leaving Donna Corblay at the Hat Ranch, Bob McGraw alighted from the train
at Bakersfield and went at once to a hotel. He arose late the next morning, breakfasted in
the most appalling loneliness and later wended his way weakly to the bank where his meager
funds were on deposit. Here he had his account balanced and discovered that his total fortune
amounted to a trifle over sixteen hundred dollars, so he closed out his account and purchased
a draft on San Francisco for the amount of his balance, less sufficient money to pay his current
expenses.

This detail attended to, Mr. McGraw next proceeded to do what he had always done when in a
civilized community--spend his money recklessly. He went back to the hotel, called Donna on
the long-distance phone and frittered away two dollars in inconsequential conversation. However,
he felt amply rewarded for the extravagance when Donna's voice--deep, throaty, almost a baritone--came
to him over the wire; the delighted, almost childish cry of amazement which greeted his "Hello,
Donna girl" was music to his soul.

Bob was the kind of man who always thinks of the little things. He knew Donna had gone to work
that morning feeling blue and lonely, and the substitution of that mood for one of genuine
happiness for the rest of the day Mr. McGraw would have considered cheap at the price of his
great toe or a hastily plucked handful of his auburn locks. As for money--bah! Had it been
his last two dollars it would have made no difference. He would have telephoned just the same
and trusted to heaven to rain manna for his next meal.

But Bob McGraw was nothing if not an impetuous lover. Even in the case of one who, like himself,
had plans afoot where every dollar counted, we might pardon readily the expenditure of two
dollars on conversation, in view of the extraordinary circumstances; but Mr. McGraw's next
move savors so strongly of the veal period of his existence that no amount of extenuating circumstances
may be adduced in defense of it. While the promoter of Donnaville was a true son of the desert,
he was college- bred, and with the sight now, for the first time in several years, of trolley
cars, automobiles and people wearing clean linen, old memories surged up in Mr. McGraw's damaged
breast, and despite the fact that his long legs were now weak and wobbly from the premature
strain of his journey from the hotel to the bank and back again, he fared forth once more and
pursued the uneven tenor of his way until he found himself in a florist's shop.

Here no less than six dozen red carnations caught Mr. McGraw's fancy, the purchase price of
which, in addition to the express charges prepaid to San Pasqual, further denuded him of ten
dollars. Into the heart of this cluster of fragrance he caused to be secreted a tiny envelope
enclosing a card, upon which he had drawn a heart with a feathered arrow sticking through it;
and for fear this symbolic declaration of undying devotion might not be sufficient, he scrawled
beneath it: "Love from Bob."

Ah, if he could only have seen Donna's face when the express messenger next door brought that
votive offering in to her! Red carnations were not frequent in San Pasqual. It was the first
lover's bouquet Donna had ever received and she bent low behind the cash register and kissed
the foolish little card, for the hand of her Bob had touched it! The carnations she bore home
to the Hat Ranch in triumph, and two weeks later when Soft Wind, a stranger to romance, threw
them out, Donna wept.

His mission of love finally accomplished, Bob returned to his hotel and went to bed. Late that
afternoon he arose, much refreshed, dined and waited around the lobby until it was time for
the bus to leave for the north-bound train.

By nine o'clock next morning he was in San Francisco. He found frugal lodgings in a third-class
hotel, and after writing a letter to Donna, he went down town, purchased a suit of "store"
clothes, and spent the balance of the day in the public law library.

By nightfall Bob had saturated his brain with legal lore bearing on every feature of the laws
governing the acquisition of lands in the public domain, and was satisfied that the hazy plan
which he had outlined was not only within the law, but really did have some vague elements
of feasibility. The beauty of Bob's plan, however--the part that appealed to the sporting instinct
in his ultra-sporty soul--lay in the fact that it would cost him only fifteen hundred dollars
to try! Twelve hundred and seventy-five in preliminary payments, filing fees and notary's fees,
and the balance in hotel bills, traveling expenses, etc.; but as an offset to his comparatively
brilliant prospects of going hungry and ragged there was the dim, long chance that he might
win millions, provided his venture should be attended with a fair percentage of supernatural
luck. That was all Bob McGraw had to cheer him on to victory--a million-to-one chance; yet,
such was his peculiar mental make-up, the terrific odds only proved an added attraction.

CHAPTER X

Now; in order to insure even perfunctory understanding of the procedure under which Bob McGraw
planned to acquire his lands, and to give an inkling of the difficulties confronting him, it
is necessary that the reader take a five-minute course in land law. This is regrettable, for
it is a dry subject, even in the matter of swamp and overflow lands, so we shall endeavor to
make the course as brief as possible.

Section sixteen and thirty-six in each township throughout the United States are commonly designated
as "school lands," for the reason that the Federal government has ceded them to the various
states, to be sold by the states for the use and benefit of their public school funds. School
lands are open to purchase by any citizen of the United States, and in the case of California
school lands the statutory price is one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre.

Now, frequently it happens that by reason of the inclusion of certain of these "school lands"
in a Forest Reserve, a Reclamation District, an Indian Reservation, a National Park, a Government
Military Reservation or an old Mexican grant (which latter condition obtains very frequently
in California, where the titles to many huge grants still hold since the days of the Mexican
occupation) they are lost to the state. In such cases, the Federal government reimburses the
state suffering such loss of school lands, by extending to the state the privilege of selecting
from the public lands within its borders an acreage corresponding to the acreage thus lost
by reason of inclusion in a restricted area.

The lands thus selected from the public domain in exchange for school lands lost to the state,
having been taken in lieu, thereof, are known as "state lieu lands," and the lands which were
originally state school lands and which have been lost to the state by reason of their inclusion
in some restricted area, are spoken of as the "basis" for the exchange. If there are no school
lands open for purchase at the time, naturally they cannot be purchased; but if, on the contrary,
the state owns many sections of school lands which have been included in restricted areas,
the surveyor-general will select for the applicant from the public domain such state lieu lands
as the purchaser may desire. However, no such selection of lieu lands can be made by the surveyor-general
unless there is a corresponding loss of school lands as the basis for the selection.

Now, this basis constituted the horns of a dilemma upon which Bob McGraw had once found himself
impaled in an attempt to purchase three hundred and twenty acres of timbered land in the public
domain--land which he knew would, in the course of a few years, become very valuable. Bob's
restless nature would not permit of his taking up the claim under the homestead law, for that
would entail residence on the property for more years than Bob could afford to remain away
from his beloved desert; hence he decided to acquire it by purchase as state lieu land at a
time when he knew there were no available school lands lying outside restricted areas. Mr.
McGraw saw an attractive profit in purchasing at one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre
three hundred and twenty acres of timber worth fully fifty dollars per acre.

Thrilled, therefore, with most pleasurable anticipations, Mr. McGraw had duly filed his application
for purchase of this particular half- section, under Section 3495 of the Political Code of
the State of California. He knew that, owing to the recent extension of the Forest Reserve
policy, thousands of acres of school lands had recently been lost to the state, and that therefore,
under the law, there could be no legal hindrance to his purchase of lieu lands--particularly
in view of the fact that there were several hundred thousand acres of government lands within
the state from which to make his selection!

To Bob's surprise, his application for the purchase of lieu lands had been denied, under a
ruling of the State Land Office--a ruling having absolutely no foundation under any section
of legislative procedure-- which stipulated that before the State Land Office could receive
or grant an application for the purchase of lieu lands, the intending purchaser must first
designate the basis of corresponding loss to the state of school lands.

"Bless my innocent soul," Mr. McGraw had murmured at the time, "what a curious rule! I had
a notion that that was the surveyor-general's business, not mine. I had a notion that he was
paid for compiling that information for the people, and not forcing them to compile it for
themselves."

However, in no whit daunted by the prospect of a little research work, Bob had had recourse
to the land maps in the office. To his surprise and chagrin he discovered that as fast as he
brought to light a "basis" for his selection, he was informed, after some perfunctory investigation
by the employees of the State Land Office that these bases had already been used! Eventually
the light of reason began to sift through the fog of despair and suddenly Bob had a very brilliant
idea.

"Euchred!" he muttered to himself. "I do not happen to possess the requisite amount of inside
information and I have no means of obtaining it until I ascertain where it is for sale! The
purpose of this ridiculous rule is to keep the rabble out of the public domain until some middleman
gets a profit out of his information. I'll just give up for the time being and await results."

Bob did not have long to wait. Within a week he received a letter from an alleged land attorney,
offering to locate him on state lieu lands worth fifty dollars per acre, in return for the
trifling payment of one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre to the state and the further
trifling payment of ten dollars per acre to the purveyor of information respecting the necessary
basis for the exchange!

At the time this procedure had struck Bob as rather humorous. He was an ardent admirer of genius
wherever lie saw it, and even this exhibition of evil genius, which so adroitly deprived him
of his constitutional right to the public domain without the payment of a middleman's profit,
rather aroused his admiration. I accommodate of man.

THE PROPOSITION IS THIS

I have information of some state lieu lands which I believe can be taken up under the State
laws at $1.25 per acre. The right to buy them will very probably have to be established and
enforced by legal proceedings.

Now, this right to purchase state lieu lands is a limited personal right. (See Political Code,
Section 3495, et seq.) I am willing to try to make YOUR right good to a tract of this land,
under the conditions of the contract herewith. I am willing to stand the expenses of suit to
enforce your right, and to advance for you the legal fees and the first preliminary payment
to the state, on the chance of being able to secure you something sufficiently valuable to
justify you in paying me the fee provided for in the contract. Read the contract carefully
and note that you retain the right to cancel it and relieve yourself of all obligation in the
matter by abandoning your claim to the land.

READ THE CONTRACT CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU SIGN IT. BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND JUST WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

ROBERT MCGRAW.

"That looks like fair warning" mused Mr. McGraw, as he reread this document. "I defy any man
to look between the lines and scent my hocus- pocus game."

Bob next proceeded to draw up the contract. It was a simple contract, framed in language that
could not fail of comprehension by the dullest mind. For and in consideration of the sum of
one dollar, the receipt whereof was duly acknowledged, Bob McGraw agreed to furnish, his applicants
for land with certain valuable information, whereby the applicant would be enabled to file,
or tender his application for, certain state lieu lands, "bounded and particularly described
as follows:" (Here he left a space sufficient for the insertion, at a later date, of the exact
description of the lands he desired; the descriptions he would glean from maps of the valley
on sale in the United States Land Office in San Francisco.)

He agreed to tender the application of his client to the State Land Office and to conduct,
at his own expense, any litigation that might arise or become necessary to establish the right
of his client to purchase the land from the state; stipulating, however, that he (McGraw) should
be the sole judge of the necessity for such litigation. He agreed to pay the filing fees and
the first payment on the land, required at the time of filing the application, and to represent
the applicant before the state land office; also to notify his client, by registered letter,
at the address given him, whenever the application should be approved; and it was distinctly
stipulated that the applicant should not be required to elect whether or not he would abandon
the application until served with this written notice!

In consideration, also, of the services, fees and costs provided for in the contract, Mr. McGraw
would make a charge of Three Dollars per acre for all, or any part, of the land which the applicant
might be awarded the opportunity to purchase; this fee to be payable to him, his heirs or assigns,
if and whenever the application of his client should be duly approved by the Registrar of the
State Land Office.

In consideration of these covenants, the applicant was to bind himself to pay Mr. Robert McGraw
the stipulated fee of Three Dollars per acre, in addition to the One Dollar and Twenty-five
Cents per acre demanded by the state, reserving, however, the right to abandon his filing at
any time prior to its approval by the Registrar of the State Land Office, but pledging himself
not to abandon without first furnishing his attorney (Robert McGraw) with a proper instrument
of abandonment, in order that some other person might be located on the land. In addition the
applicant was required to state that he was duly qualified, under the law, to make the application
and that he had read both the application form and the contract and was familiar with the section
of the code under which he made it.

A critical perusal of the terms of this shrewd contract will readily convince even a layman
that it was perfectly legal. Bob hurled mental defiance at every legal light in the country
to prove collusion and conspiracy to defraud under that contract. It proved merely that Bob
McGraw was acting in his capacity as a duly authorized attorney-at-law, seeking to turn an
honest penny.

Now, in the first place, the abandonment clause in the contract, while not holding his client
to the contract, nevertheless held the land to Bob McGraw! He anticipated that, in the event
of his success in forcing the registrar of the state land office to accept and approve the
applications, the land ring would immediately seek out each applicant, charge the applicant
with being a party to a gigantic land fraud conspiracy and threaten him with a Federal Grand
Jury investigation in case he did not at once abandon his filing! The poor and the ignorant
are easily intimidated, and Bob McGraw had figured on this. In the event of "cold feet" on
the part of his applicant, the applicant would come to him, to abandon, as per the terms of
the contract, but by that time Bob would have a man with nerve to take his place, and his scheme
would still be impervious to "leaks!" While the land was "tied up" by a McGraw applicant, Bob
knew the enemy could not get it.

When Bob's clients signed that contract, it meant nothing! But the moment the applications
were approved for patent, and the State Land Office had so notified him, and he, in turn, had
so notified his clients, his clients were no longer his clients. They were his victims! His
contract then constituted a promissory note, and Mr. McGraw knew enough law to realize that
failure to pay a promissory note or perform a contract is actionable. Should his client repudiate
the contract prior to the approval of the application, he was safe; but to repudiate it after
approval and after Bob McGraw had advanced him the money to pay for the land--ah, that was
a different matter. Bob McGraw knew he could secure a judgment against his unfortunate client
in any court of law in the country--and the land was good for the judgment! Having advanced
the cash to purchase the land for his clients, Bob McGraw would hold that deadly contract over
their heads as security for the advance!

Under the terms of the contract, when fulfilled, each client would owe Bob his three dollars
per acre on six hundred and forty acres, or a total of one thousand nine hundred and forty
dollars as a legal attorney's fee, and to the clients that Bob McGraw intended to select, a
debt of such magnitude would loom up in all the pristine horror of the end of the world at
hand and salvation not yet in sight. With, malice aforethought the promoter of Donnaville was
trading on the credulity of the very people he planned to benefit! He knew with what ease the
poor rush into debt where the creditor requires nothing down; he knew also the avidity with
which they grasp the first means of escape from the burden, once it becomes onerous; and at
the thought the villain McGraw chuckled pleasurably.

"Once under the McGraw thumb, and I have them! I'll demand cash on the nail for my services.
They will be unable to pay me. I'll harass them and threaten to sue them, and then, when I
have them thoroughly cowed, I'll send a secret agent around to buy their land from them at
ten dollars an acre. After using their constitutional right to purchase lieu lands, they are
entitled to a profit on the investment, and besides, I must show a 'valuable consideration'
or have a secret service operative trailing me.

 Apparently he was the sole applicant for desert
lands that morning, and anticipating that there would be no great rush to file entries he set
his suit-case down in the corridor, sat himself on the suit-case and waited for the office
to open for business. In order to make certain that he would not be usurped in line, however,
when the office opened for business, he had placed his suitcase directly in front of the door,
against which he leaned his weary back. The door, he noticed, opened from within. In case it
opened secretly, Mr. McGraw would thus fall into the surveyor-general's office, and hardy,
indeed, would be he who could dispute his claim to priority in the line. In fact, so satisfied
was he with this strategic position, and so tired and drowsy was he withal, that presently
he relaxed his determination to remain wide awake.

CHAPTER XII

The first intimation that Bob received of this laxity came in the shape of a sharp dig in the
ribs from the index finger of a young man who demanded to know why Mr. McGraw didn't wake up
and pay for his lodging. Bob turned his startled sleepy eyes up at the stranger. He had expected
to confront a janitor, but his first glance informed him that he was mistaken. The individual
before him evidently was a state employee; but for all that Bob could advance no excuse for
his free and easy action in assaulting him with his index finger. No one except the janitor
or the night watchman had a right to such familiarity with Mr. McGraw's ribs and he resented
being told to wake up before he was ready.

"You'll have to get out of my way, friend" the stranger informed him.

"Not if I know it, old-timer" replied Bob. "I'm first in line, with orders to stick here and
maintain my position at all hazards. I'll share the suit-case with you, but you mustn't try
to crush in in advance of me."

The stranger eyed him curiously. "I'm an employee of the state land office" he said coolly.
"Please permit me to get into the office."

Bob looked at his watch. It was just eight o'clock, and he knew that the land office did not
open until nine. He wondered who this industrious individual might be and what reason he had
for getting down to work an hour beforehand; and then; like a bolt from the blue, The Big Idea
flashed into Bob McGraw's brain.

He yawned sleepily. "Great snakes!" he said, "I've been waiting here an hour for you. I beg
your pardon, old-timer. I didn't recognize you at first, although I should have known you right
off by that little mole on your left cheek."

He scrambled to his feet and picked up his suit-case, while the stranger looked at him sharply.

"Why are you here so early?" he demanded. Bob McGraw would have liked to ask him the same question
but he refrained.

"There's been an inquisitive stranger investigating the old man and-- well, you know what a
fox Carey is? At the last moment it didn't seem wise to come through on the original programme,
so I came up instead. I'm used to taking chances and I'm going to be well paid for this."

Was it fancy, or did Bob really detect a more friendly light in the man's eyes? He decided
that he had not overplayed his hand, so, fearful that he might, he remained discreetly silent
and waited for the door to be opened. The stranger inserted the key in the lock and stepped
into the room. Bob followed him uninvited, turned carefully and sprung the lock on the door.
The deputy (for such Bob guessed him to be) passed through a gate in the counter and on into
an inner office. He returned a moment later, pulling on his office coat. At the counter he
paused and faced Bob. There was still a suspicious look in his alert intelligent eyes.

Bob drew the fifty applications from his suit-case and passed them over the counter. "Hurry
with them" he said. "There isn't any time to lose. Did Carey tell you anything about that fellow
McGraw, who filed on the Cottonwood lake water?"

The deputy nodded.

"He's dangerous" warned Mr. McGraw. "He's tumbled to the little combination and he'll upset
the apple-cart if you don't beat him to it. He may attempt to bully the old man into a consolidation
by threatening to mandamus your chief and force him to accept the filings. McGraw's dangerous
and he's got big influence behind him. The old man's worried."

The deputy arched his eyebrows cynically. "Where do you come in?" he queried.

Bob drew back the lapel of his coat and showed the butt of his automatic gun nestling under
his left arm.

"I'm playing a purely professional engagement, my friend. If McGraw should show up here this
morning it is my business to take care of him."

The deputy's suspicions were allayed at last. He smiled in friendly fashion.

"Keep him away until nine-thirty and there's no danger" he said. He scooped up Bob's applications
and skimmed through them. "Did you bring the coin?"

Bob placed twelve hundred and fifty dollars on the counter and shoved it toward the deputy.

"I won't wait for the receipts. It's too risky. Make them out as fast as you can and I'll call
for them after the office opens." He grinned knowingly. "I'm going out in the corridor to keep
inquisitive people away and give you time to work."

"You didn't bring the instruments of abandonment for the old filings--"

"I know it. Carey has them. He'll probably bring them over himself later in the day. Too risky--getting
over here so early. There's a gumshoe man on his trail."

"All right" said the deputy, and hastened to his desk with the bundle of applications. Bob
unlatched the door, peered cautiously up and down the deserted corridor, and apparently finding
the coast clear stepped out into the hall.

For fifteen minutes he walked up and down the corridor without meeting any one more formidable
than the janitor, and presently the janitor, having completed the sweeping of the corridor,
betook himself and his brooms elsewhere. He came back a few minutes later, however, and disappeared
in a small room at the end of the corridor, only to reappear again with a bucket of wet sawdust
in his hand.

Bob McGraw walked to the main entrance of the State House and back again to the door of the
land office. Still nobody came. He was approaching the main entrance to the State House a second
time when he heard an automobile chugging through the capitol grounds and pause outside the
main entrance. Half a minute later a man appeared at the head of the corridor and approached
rapidly. As he came nearer Bob saw that he was about fifty years old. He wore a carefully trimmed
imperial and a gold pince-nez and seemed to exude a general air of pomposity and power. He
had glittering cold gray eyes and they snapped now with anger and apprehension as he half walked,
half ran, down the corridor. Bob's keen glance, roving over the man for details, observed that
he carried a small Gladstone bag in his right hand, but inasmuch as the front end of the bag
carried no initials, Bob waited until the man had passed him and then cast a sidelong glance
at the other end of it. In small gold letters across its base he read the initials: T. M. C.

"T. Morgan Carey!"

In a bound Bob was at the stranger's side and laid a firm detaining grip on the latter's arm.
The man turned angrily and glared at Bob.

"Mr. T. Morgan Carey?" said Bob McGraw quietly, "you're wanted!"

The man trembled. Bob could feel a distinct quiver pass up the arm he was holding.

"Wha--what--who wants me?" he said.

"Your dear old Uncle Samuel. He'd like to have you explain a delicate matter in connection
with the public domain. Give me the little grip and come along quietly. I think that would
be the better way. If you make a row about it, of course I'll have to put the bracelets on
you; and I'm sure neither of us wishes that to happen, Mr. Carey."

Bob spoke kindly, almost regretfully, but there was no mistaking the fact that he meant business.
T. Morgan Carey's face was ghastly. He surrendered the grip without protest, the while he gazed
at Bob like a trapped animal. Presently he managed to pull himself together sufficiently to
demand in a trembling voice:

"But--why--I don't understand. Where's your authority? Have you a warrant for--this--this outrageous
procedure?"

"I have no warrant for you, Mr. Carey. I--"

"Then let me pass about my business, sir. How dare--"

"Easy, easy! You are not arrested in the commonly accepted sense of that term, but if you play
horse with me you will be. I came here this morning to find you and ask you to come quietly
with me and answer a few questions; also to let me see what you're carrying in this grip. Come
along now, Carey. You only make out a case against yourself by resisting. I suppose you are
aware of the fact that a secret service agent requires no warrant to make an arrest. (Bob did
not know that such was the case, but he made the statement at any rate.) You are temporarily--apprehended--upon
information and belief. If you are worried about the publicity that may attach, I give you
my word the newspapers shall not hear of this unless a formal charge is entered against you.
Come with me if you please, Mr. Carey."

He drew Carey's right arm through his own strong left and marched him down the corridor. It
had been his first intention to escort T. Morgan Carey to the office of the now defunct Desert
Development Company and lock him up there for the good of his soul--but a more convenient means
of marooning his enemy now presented itself. The door to the janitor's room was open; an electric
light burned within, and from the keyhole of the half open door a bunch of keys was suspended.

Bob's brain worked with the rapidity of a camera-shutter. He threw Carey's bag into the room,
whirled and clamped his right hand over Carey's mouth, while with his powerful left arm around
the land- grabber's body he gently steered his victim into the room. Carey struggled desperately,
but Bob held him powerless. Finding himself as helpless as a child in that grizzly-bear grip,
he ceased his struggles. Instantly he was tripped up and laid gently on the floor, on his back,
with Bob McGraw's one hundred and eighty pounds of bone and muscle camped on his torso, holding
him down. With his right hand effectually silencing Carey's gurgling cries for help, and a
knee on each arm to hold Carey still, with his left hand Bob drew a bandanna handkerchief from
his pocket and gagged his man with as much ease as he would have muzzled a little dog. Then
he searched through his victim's pockets until he found the land-grabber's handkerchief; whereupon
he flopped Carey on his face and bound his hands behind him. It was but the work of an instant
for Bob to tear off his own suspenders and bind Carey's ankles together. Next he rooted through
a bin of waste paper and found some stout cord with which he bound Carey at the knees. Then,
leaving his victim helpless on the floor, he picked up the little bag, turned off the light,
stepped softly out, closed and locked the door behind him, slipped the bunch of keys into his
pocket, and returned to the land office. He knocked, and presently the door of the private
office further down the hall opened gently and the deputy glanced warily out. Seeing Bob at
the main entrance he went around and let him in.

"I took a chance" Bob explained, "and went out after the balance of the dope. Any sign of the
other gang around?"

"Not a soul."

"Good news. I had an idea Carey put those abandonment papers in this little bag" and he held
up the bag in such a manner that the deputy could not fail to see the initials T. M. C. on
one end. This had the effect of allaying any lingering suspicion which the deputy may have
been entertaining, and without waiting to see the contents of the bag he hurried back to his
desk to complete the work of filing Bob's fifty applications.

In the meantime Bob had opened the bag. It contained applications for seventy-odd sections
of land in Owens River Valley, together with an equal number of instruments of abandonment
of filings on land throughout the state.

It was as Bob had suspected. The corrupt deputy had informed Carey where the loss of school
land would occur. Carey's dummy entrymen had tied up for him these bases of exchange for lieu
lands by instantly applying for worthless lieu lands, and these applications had been held
up in the land office unacted upon, in order that the bases might show of record as used; then,
at the word from Carey, these filings on worthless land had been abandoned, in order that Carey
might use the bases for the acquisition of the lands he really desired.

"I'm a fool for luck" murmured Bob McGraw, as he counted off fifty of these instruments of
abandonment, closed the bag and set it in the corner with his suit-case. He approached the
counter and tossed the lot over to the deputy.

"Here are the instruments of abandonment, old-timer," he said casually. "I had a notion Carey
put them in that grip. Better get 'em on record right away and let those receipts for the filings
slide until the office opens for business. I'll go outside and lean up against the door. Don't
worry. I'll be first in line, and if the other gang should be at my heels I'll slip you over
a bunch of dummies, to throw 'em off the scent, and you can hand me back the receipts for the
real thing." He winked comically and went out into the corridor again.

Slowly the minutes dragged by. Bob looked at his watch. It was a quarter of nine. Five minutes
passed and still the corridor was deserted. Two minutes more flitted by and then the janitor
came around the corner from the next corridor, a bucket in one hand and a mop in the other.
Bob grinned as he saw the man try the door of the room where T. Morgan Carey lay trussed up.
He rattled the knob several times, then searched his pockets for his keys. Not finding them,
he went away grumbling.

It was just nine o'clock when the janitor returned. Bob McGraw was close enough, to him now
to see that he carried a key, which he slipped into the lock, opened the door and passed into
the gloom of the room beyond. Bob trembled lest he step on T. Morgan Carey's face. While the
janitor was fumbling for the electric switch, Bob stepped softly in after him, and as softly
closed the door behind him, just as the janitor switched on the light. He turned at the slight
sound of the closing door and found himself gazing down the long blue barrel of an automatic gun.

"No unnecessary noise, if you please" said Bob McGraw gently. "This is one of those rare occasions

"Bob!"

It was he, looking perfectly splendid in a marvelous blue suit that must have cost at least
eighteen dollars. He held out his hands, drew her to him and, in the sight of all mankind,
he kissed her, and whispered to her endearing little names. She could not reply to them; she
could only take his hand, like a little lost child, and follow him through the car, down the
steps and into the hotel bus which was to take them up town. And on the way up town neither
spoke to the other, for it seemed to each that even their most commonplace remarks to-day must
be freighted with something sacred, in which the inquisitive world at large would be bound
to manifest a stupendous interest. And inasmuch as it was plainly none of the world's business--

The bus had stopped in front of a tremendous hotel. It was four stories high! All along the
front of the first story it was glass and Donna could look right through it and see everything
that was going on inside! She paused on the top step of the bus to view the marvels of this
town of less than twenty thousand inhabitants, and then a skeezicks of a boy, very gay in brass
buttons, and with a darling little round cap on his perky head, came and took forcible possession
of her suit-case. He tore it right out of Bob's hand and ran away with it. Donna was on the
point of crying out at the theft, when Bob reached up and lifted her bodily to the ground.

"Reuben! Reuben!" he breathed tenderly in her ear, "don't stare so at the great round world.
You're so beautiful," he added, "and I'm so proud of you! Where did you get that marvelous dress?"

She glanced up at him, radiant. He was proud of her! He liked her dress! It was sufficient.
Bob McGraw, man of the world, had set the stamp of his approval on his bride, and nothing else
mattered any more. She followed him into the hotel, where he checked her suit-case with the
skeezicks who had stolen it, and then led her into the dining-room.

"Let's have lunch, Donna" he said, "or at least pretend to. I couldn't eat now. I want to talk.
The man who can eat on his wedding day is a vulgarian, and dead to the finer feelings."

They found a secluded table and ordered something, and when the waitress had taken the order
and departed, Bob leaned across the table.

"You're so beautiful!" he repeated. "I love you in that white suit."

"I hadn't anything but this old thing, dear. I hated to come up looking like a frump--"

"Listen to the girl! Why, you old sweetheart-"

"Do you love me, Bob?"

"More than ever. In the matter of love, Donna, absence really makes the heart--"

"How much?" She lifted her face toward him adoringly.

"Ten hundred thousand million dollars' worth" he declared, and they both laughed.

"I don't know whether you're a man or just a big boy" Donna told him. She sighed. "But then
I don't know anything to-day, except that if I am ever happier than I am this minute I shall
die. I shall not be able to stand it. But, dearie! You haven't told me a word about Donnaville!"

So Bob related to her a minute history of himself from the moment he had left her until he
had leaned over her in the observation car. He described, with inimitable wit and enjoyment,
his experience in the land office, and together they examined the fifty receipts.

"I'm sorry you had to lock Mr. Carey in the room and gag him and tie him up" said Donna regretfully.
"Maybe he'll have you arrested!"

"I'm sorry, too, dear. But then it was the only thing I could do and I had to keep him quiet.
Oh, I don't care" he added defiantly. "I'd muss up an old crook like Carey every hour for your
sake. But he won't have me arrested. That would be too dangerous for him."

"Then you can get the land right away?" she queried.

He shook his head. "The cards haven't even been dealt, sweetheart. My applications will almost
certainly be held up six months in the state land office before they are approved by the surveyor-general
and forwarded to the Commissioner of the General Land Office at Washington to be passed to
patent by the United States. And I shall be very greatly surprised if Carey hasn't a friend
in Washington who will see that the granting of the patents is delayed for several years. Then,
when the matter cannot be delayed any longer, Carey will induce one of his dummies to protest
the applications, alleging that they are part of a gigantic land fraud scheme, and a few more
years will go by while this protest is being investigated."

"But you'll win in the long run, will you not?"

He shrugged expressively. "I may. I anticipate that Carey will give me all the time he can
to get my water-right developed and earn thirty- nine thousand dollars to pay for the land
for my Pagans."

"But I thought Mr. Dunstan had promised to loan you that money?"

"Homer Dunstan is an old man, Donna girl. If he should die in the interim, my name is in the
lion's mouth."

"But what are we to do, Bobby?" she quavered, suddenly frightened, as the enormousness of the
man's task loomed before her.

"Quien sabe" he said ruefully. "We'll marry first and think of it afterward--that is, if you
still think you want to marry a chap whose cash assets represent less than thirty dollars of
borrowed money."

She thought swiftly of the boor who had spoken to her on the train that morning; of her dull
lonely changeless life in San Pasqual; and the longing for protection was very great indeed.
She wanted some one on whom she might lean in the hour of stress and woe, and she had selected
him for that signal honor. Why, then, should they not marry? They would not always be poor.
He had his work to do and she had hers, and their marriage need not interfere. She wanted to
help him, and with her woman's intuition she realized that his was the nature that yearns for
the accomplishment of great things when spurred to action by the praise and comfort of a mate
in sympathy with his dreams and his ideals. She almost shuddered to think of what might happen
to him should he marry a girl who did not understand him! It seemed to her that for his sake,
if for no other, she must marry him, and when she raised her brilliant eyes to his he read
her answer in their limpid depths.

"Do you need me?" she queried.

"Very much" he answered humbly, "but not enough to insist upon you sharing my poverty with
me. You're self-supporting and it isn't fair to you, but rather selfish on my part. And you
must realize, Donna dear, that I cannot remain in San Pasqual. I have my work to do; I must
make money, and I cannot take you to the place where I hope to make it."

"I expect to be left alone, Bob. But I do not mind that. I've lived alone at the Hat Ranch
a long time, dear, and I can stand it a little longer. I do not wish to tie you to my apron-strings
and hamper you. What are your plans?"

"Well," he said a little sheepishly, "I thought I'd like to make one more trip into the desert.
I have some claims over by Old Woman mountain, in San Bernardino county, and they're pockety.
I might clean up a stake in there this winter. It's about the only chance I have to raise the
wind, but even then it's a gambler's chance."

He was a Desert Rat! The lure of the waste places was calling to him again, tormenting him
with the promise of rich reward in the country just beyond. Donna thought of her own father
who had left his bride on a similar errand, and the thought that Bob, too, might not come back
stabbed her with sudden anguish. But he was a man, and he knew best; in a desert country some
one must do the desert work; he loved it and she would not say him nay. Yet the big tears trembled
on her long lashes as she thought of what lay before him and her heart ached that it must be
so. He watched her keenly, waiting for the protest which he thought must come. Presently she spoke.

"We must figure on an outfit for you."

His brown eyes lit with admiration, for he realized the grief that lay behind that apparently
careless acceptance of his plan, and loved her the more for her courage.

"Yes, I'll need two burros, with packs, and some drills, tools, dynamite and grub--two hundred
dollars will outfit me nicely. I'll have to scout around and borrow the money somewhere, and
to be quite candid, Donna, I have designs on our gambler friend, Hennage."

She smiled. "Dear, good old Harley P.! He'd grubstake you if it broke the bank."

"Well, I'm going to figure along that line at any rate. So, if you're quite ready, Donna, we'll
go down to the court-house, procure the license, hunt up a preacher and take each other for
better or for worse."

"I think it will be for better, dear."

"Well, it can't be for worse, I'm sure, than it is to-day. Nevertheless I'm a frightened man."

She ignored this subtle hint of procrastination. "I'm ready, Bob. But before we start, there's
one matter that I haven't explained to you. I do not care to have our marriage known. Those
talkative people in San Pasqual would--talk, under the circumstances--that is, dear, I want
to keep right on at the eating-house until you're ready to take me away from San Pasqual forever.
Now, I know that's going to hurt you--that thought of your wife working--but nobody need ever
know it, and when you're ready we'll leave the horrible old place and never go back any more.
We have so much to do, Bob, and--"

"You do hurt me, Donna" he protested. "You have exacted from me a promise and you are forcing
me to fulfill it under circumstances which render it mighty hard. Of course we love each other
and I do want to marry you, but ah, Donna, I don't feel like a man to-day, but a mendicant.
What can I do, sweetheart? If you marry me to-day you'll have to work if you want to live."
There was misery in his glance. "However, all my life I've been doing things differently--or
rather indifferently--so why should I stop now? It will at least comfort me out there alone
in the desert to know that I have a wife waiting at home for me. I think the joy of that will
outweigh the sting of shame that a married pauper must feel--"

"No, no, Bob, you mustn't say that. You mustn't feel that way about it. You are not a pauper."
She stood up and he helped her into her coat, and after paying the waitress they departed together
for the city hall.

But Bob was a sad bridegroom. Donna had wired him that she had arranged for a two-weeks' vacation,
and he had been at pains to acquaint her with the extreme low ebb of his finances, in the hope
that she would voluntarily suggest a delay of their marriage, but to his great distress she
had not seen fit to take his pathetic hint--she who ordinarily was so quick of comprehension;
so, rather than refer to the matter again, he decided to step into a telegraph station immediately
after the ceremony and send a hurried call for help to Harley P. Hennage--the gambler being
the only man of his acquaintance whom he knew to be sufficiently good-natured and careless
with money to respond to his appeal.

When at length they reached the city hall Donna waited, blushing, outside the door of the marriage
bureau while Bob entered and parted with two dollars and fifty cents for the parchment which
gave him a legal right to commit what he called a social and economic crime. Later he came
out and insisted that Donna should return with him to Cupid's window, there to receive the
customary congratulations and handshake from Bob's acquaintance who had issued him the license,
and who, following the practice of such individuals, felt it incumbent upon him to offer his
felicitations to every customer.

Leaving the court-house Bob and Donna wandered about town until they came to a church. A gentleman
of color, engaged in washing the church windows, directed them to the pastor's residence in
the next block. They accordingly; proceeded to the rectory and Bob rang the front door bell.
The pastor answered the bell in person. The bridegroom grinned at him sheepishly while the
bride, very much embarrassed, shrunk to the bridegroom's side and gazed timidly at the reverend
gentleman rubbing his hands so expectantly in the doorway.

"Won't you come in?" he said, in tones most kindly and hospitable. "Just step right into the
parlor and I'll be with you as soon as I can get my spectacles."

"Thank you" said Bob. They entered. The rector went into his study while Bob wagged a knowing
head at his broad retreating back.

"He knows what we want, you bet" he whispered. "No flies on that preacher. I like him. I like
any man who can do things without a diagram and directions for using."

Donna nodded. She was quite impressed at the clergyman's perspicacity. She was quite self-possessed
when he returned with his spectacles, a little black book, his wife and the gardener for witnesses,
and a "here-is-the-job-I-love" expression on his amiable features. He examined the license,
satisfied himself, apparently, that it was not a forgery, and after standing Bob and Donna
up in a corner close to a terra-cotta umbrella-holder filled with pampas plumes, he proceeded
with the ceremony.

CHAPTER XIV

Now, to the man in whose nature there is a broad streak of sentiment and who looks upon his
marriage as a very sacred, solemn and lasting ceremony, no speech in life is so provocative
of profound emotion as the beautiful interchange of vows which links him to the woman he loves.
As Bob McGraw stood there, holding Donna's soft warm hand in his, so hard and tanned, and repeated:
"I, Robert, take thee, Donna, for my lawful wife; to have and to hold, from this day forward,
for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer (Here Bob's voice trembled a little. Why should
this question of finance arise to smite him in the midst of the marriage ceremony?), in sickness;
and in health, until death us do part," his breast swelled and a mist came into his eyes. His
voice was very low and husky as he took that sacred oath, and it seemed that he stood swaying
in a great fog, while from a great distance, yet wonderfully clear and firm and sweet, Donna's
voice reached him:

"I, Donna, take thee, Robert, for my lawful husband--" and the minister was asking him for a ring.

For a ring!

Bob started. The perspiration stood out on his forehead!--there was agony in his brown eyes.
In the sudden reaction caused by that awful request, he blurted out:

"Oh, Great Grief, Donna! I forgot all about the ring!"

"I didn't" she replied softly. From her hand-bag she produced a worn old wedding ring (it had
been her mother's) and handed it to Bob. At this he commenced to regain his composure, and
by the time he had slipped the ring on Donna's finger and plighted his troth for aye, all of
his troubles and worries vanished. Such is that, vessel she will be aloft reiterate three day do the

Then, if some prospector should be heading out my way they'll send out my letters. My claims

"The days will be very long until you come back, dear, but I'll be patient. I realize what
it means to you, and Donnaville is worth the sacrifice. You know I told you I wanted to help."

"You are helping--more than you realize. You'll be safe until I get back?"

"I've always been safe at the Hat Ranch, but if I should need a friend I can call on Harley
P. He isn't one of the presuming kind"--Donna smiled--"but he will stand the acid."

"And you will not worry if you do not receive any letters from me all the time I am away?"

"I shall know what to expect, Bob, so I shall not worry--very much."

They left the Yosemite early next morning, staging down to El Portal, and shortly after dusk
the same evening they arrived at San Pasqual. There were few people at the station when the
train pulled in, and none that Donna knew, except the station agent and his assistants; and
as these worthies were busy up at the baggage car, Bob and Donna alighted at the rear end and
under the friendly cover of darkness made their way down to the Hat Ranch.

Sam Singer and Soft Wind had not yet retired, and after seeing his bride safe in her home once
more, Bob McGraw prepared to leave her.

She was sorely tempted, at that final test of separation, to plead with him to abandon his
journey, to stay with her and their new-found happiness and leave to another the gigantic task
of reclaiming the valley. It was such a forlorn hope, after all; she began to question his
right to stake their future against that of persons to whom he owed no allegiance, until she
remembered that a great work must ever require great sacrifice; that her share in this sacrifice
was little, indeed, compared with his. Moreover, he had set his face to this task before he
had met her--she would not be worthy of him if she asked him to abandon it now.

"I must go" he said huskily. "The moon will be up by ten o'clock and I can make better time
traveling by moonlight than I can after sun-up."

She clung to him for one breathless second; then, with a final caress she sent him forth to
battle for his Pagans.

She was back at the cashier's counter in the eating-house the next morning when Harley P. Hennage
came in for his breakfast.

"Hello, Miss Donna" the unassuming one greeted her cordially. "Where've you been an' when did
you get back to San Pasqual? Why, I like to 'a died o' grief. Thought you'd run away an' got
married an' left us for good."

He watched her narrowly and noted the little blush that marked the landing of his apparently
random shot.

"I've been away on my first vacation, went up to Yosemite Valley. I got back last night."

"Glad of it" replied Mr. Hennage heartily. "Enjoy yourself?"

"It was glorious."

He talked with her for a few minutes, then waddled to his favorite seat and ordered his ham
and eggs.

"Well, she didn't fib to me, at any rate, even if she didn't tell the whole truth" he soliloquized.
"But what's chewin' the soul out o' me is this: 'How in Sam Hill did they make fifty dollars
go that far?' If I was gettin' married, fifty dollars wouldn't begin to pay for the first round
o' drinks."

It had not escaped the gambler's observing eye that Donna had been crying, so immediately after
breakfast Mr. Hennage strolled over to the feed corral, leaned his arms on the top rail and
carefully scanned the herd of horses within.

Bob McGraw's little roan cayuse was gone!

"Well, if that don't beat the Dutch!" exclaimed Mr. Hennage disgustedly. "If that young feller
ain't one fool of a bridegroom, a- runnin' away from his bride like this! For quick moves that
feller's got the California flea faded to a whisper. Two weeks ago he was a- practicin' law
in Sacramento, a-puttin' through a deal in lieu lands; then he jumps to Stockton an' wires
me for fifty dollars; then he hops to Bakersfield an' gits married, after which he lands in
the Yosemite Valley on his honeymoon. From there he jumps to San Pasqual, an' from San Pasqual
he fades away into the desert an' leaves his bride at home a-weepin' an' a-cryin'. I don't
understand this business nohow, an' I'll be dog-goned if I'm a-goin' to try. It's too big an
order."

Three days later Harley P. Hennage wished that he had not been so inquisitive. That glance
into the feed corral was to cost him many a pang and many a dollar; for, with rare exceptions,
there is no saying so true as this: that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

CHAPTER XV

The once prosperous mining camp of Garlock is a name and a memory now. Were it not that the
railroad has been built in from San Pasqual a hundred and fifty miles up country through the
Mojave, Garlock would be a memory only. But some official of the road, imbued, perhaps, with
a remnant of sentimental regret for the fast-vanishing glories of the past, has caused to be
erected beside the track a white sign carrying the word Garlock in black letters; otherwise
one would scarcely realize that once a thriving camp stood in the sands back of this sign-board
of the past. Even in the days when the stage line operated between San Pasqual and Keeler,
Garlock had run its race and the Argonauts had moved on, leaving the rusty wreck of an old
stamp-mill, the decayed fragments of half a dozen pine shanties and a few adobe casas with
the sod roofs fallen in.

There are a few deep uncovered wells in this deserted camp, filthy with the rotting carcasses
of desert animals which have crawled down these wells for life--and remained for death. But
no human being resides in Garlock. It is a sad and lonely place. The hills that rise back of
the ruins are scarlet with oxide of iron; in the sheen of the westering sun they loom harsh
and repellent, provocative of the thought that from the very inception of Garlock their crests
have been the arena of murder-- spattered with the blood of the hardy men who made the camp
and then deserted it.

Therefore, one would not be surprised at anything happening in Garlock --where it would seem
a wanton waste of imagination to look forward to anything happening--yet at about noon of the
day that Harley P. Hennage looked over the rail fence into the feed corral at San Pasqual and
discovered that Bob McGraw's horse was gone, a man on a tired horse rode up from the south,
turned in through the ruined doorway of one of the roofless tumble-down adobe houses, and concealed
himself and his horse in the area formed by the four crumbling walls.

He dismounted, unsaddled and rubbed down his dripping horse with handfuls of the withered grasses
that grew within the ruins. Next, the man hunted through Garlock until he found an old rusty
kerosene can with a wire handle fitted through it, and to this he fastened a long horsehair
hitching rope and drew water from one of the filthy wells. The horse drank greedily and nickered
reproachfully when the man informed him that he must cool off before being allowed to drink
his fill.

For an hour the man sat on his saddle and smoked; then, after drawing several cans of water
for the horse, he spread the saddle-blanket on the ground and poured thereon a feed of oats
from a meager supply cached on the saddle. From the saddle-bags he produced a small can of
roast beef and some dry bread, which he "washed down" with water from his canteen while the
horse munched at the oats.

Late in the afternoon the man stepped to the ruined doorway and looked south. Three miles away
a splotch of dust hung high in the still atmosphere; beneath it a black object was crawling
steadily toward Garlock. It was the up stage from San Pasqual for Keeler, and the stranger
in Garlock had evidently been awaiting its arrival, for he dodged back into the enclosure,
saddled his horse, gathered up his few belongings and seemed prepared to evacuate at a moment's
notice. He peered out, as the old Concord coach lurched through the sand past the bones of
Garlock, and observed the express messenger nodding a little wearily, his eyes half closed
in protest against the glare of earth and sky.

Suddenly the express messenger started, and looked up. He had a haunting impression that somebody
was watching him--and he was not mistaken. Over the crest of an adobe wall he saw the head
and shoulders of a man. Also he saw one of the man's hands. It contained a long blue- barreled
automatic pistol, which was pointed at him. From behind a mask fashioned from a blue bandanna
handkerchief came the expected summons:

"Hands up!"

The driver pulled up his horses and jammed down the brake. The express messenger, surprised,
hesitated a moment between an impulse to obey the stern command and a desire to argue the matter
with his sawed-off shotgun. The man behind the wall, instantly realizing that he must be impressive
at all cost, promptly fired and lifted the pipe out of the messenger's mouth. The latter swore,
and his arms went over his head in a twinkling.

"Don't do that again" he growled. "I know when a man's got the drop on me."

"I was afraid your education had been neglected" the hold-up man retorted pleasantly. "Throw
out the box! No, not you. The driver will throw it out. You keep your hands up."

The express box dropped into the greasewood beside the trail with a heavy metallic thud that
augured a neat profit for the man behind the wall.

"The passengers will please alight on this side of the stage, turn their pockets inside out
and deposit their coin on top of the box" continued the road agent. "My friend with the spike
beard and the gold eye-glasses! You dropped something on the bed of the stage. Pick it up,
if you're anxious to retain a whole hide. Thank you! That pocketbook looks fat. Now, one at
a time and no crowding. Omit the jewelry. I want cash."

The highwayman continued to discourse affably with his victims while the little pile of coin
and bills on top of the box grew steadily. When it was evident that the job was complete he
ordered the passengers back into the stage and addressed the driver.

feller, Doc, an' it ain't right to kick him when he's down. He oughter be lifted up an' given
a chance to make good."

Doc Taylor shook his head dubiously. He realized that Harley P.'s plan was best, and in his
innermost soul he commended it as a proper Christian course. But he also remembered to have
heard somewhere that godless men like Harley P. Hennage and the outlaw McGraw had a habit of
being friendly and faithful to each other in just such emergencies--a sort of "honor among
thieves" arrangement, and despite Mr. Hennage's kindly words, Doc Taylor doubted their sincerity.
In fact, the whole thing was irregular, for even after the return of the stolen money the bandit
would still owe a debt to society--and moreover, the worthy doctor was the joint possessor,
with Harley P. Hennage, of an astounding secret, the disclosure of which would make him the
hero of San Pasqual for a day at least.

"I can't agree to that, Hennage" he began soberly.

"It doesn't look right to me to let a stage-robber go scot-free--"

"Well, I tell you, Doc," drawled Mr. Hennage serenely, "it'd better look right to you, an'
damned quick at that. You seem to think I'm here a-askin' a favor o' you. Not much. I never
ask favors o' no man. I'm just as independent as a hog on ice; if I don't stand up I can set
down. I run a square game myself an' I want a square game from the other fellow. Now, Doc,
you just so much as say 'Boo' about this thing, an' by the Nine Gods o' War I'll kill you.
D'ye understand, Doc? I'll kill you like I would a tarantula. An' when they come to ask you
the name o' the man you 'tended at the Hat Ranch you tell 'em his name is-- lemme see, now--yes,
his name is Roland McGuire. That's a nice name, an' it corresponds to the initials on the saddle."

Doc Taylor looked into the gambler's hard face, which was thrust close to his. The mouth of
the worst man in San Pasqual was drawn back in a half snarl that was almost coyote-like; his
small deep-set eyes bespoke only too truly the firmness of purpose that lay behind their blazing
menace. For fully thirty seconds those terrible eyes flamed, unblinking, on Doc Taylor; then
Mr. Hennage spoke.

"Now, what is his name goin' to be, Doc?"

"Roland McGuire" said Doc Taylor, and swallowed his Adam's apple twice.

"Bright boy. Go to the head o' the class an' don't forget to remember to stick there."

CHAPTER XVI

Mr. Hennage turned slowly and walked out of the drug-store, for he had accomplished his mission.
Once again, without recourse to violence, he had maintained his reputation as the worst man
in San Pasqual, for his power lay, not in a clever bluff, but in his all-too-evident downright
honesty of purpose. Had Doc Taylor presumed to fly in the face of Providence, after that warning,
Mr. Hennage felt that the responsibility must very properly rest on the doctor, for the gambler
would have killed him as surely as he had the strength to work his trigger finger.

"Well, that's over" he muttered as he returned to his room. "She's woman enough to cover the
rest o' the trail herself now, poor girl, an' in about a week I'll pull the big sting that's
hurtin' her most."

Hastily he packed a suit-case with his few simple belongings, for in his haste he was forced
to abandon his old rawhide trunk that had accompanied him in his wanderings for twenty years.
But one article did Mr. Hennage remove from his trunk. It was an old magazine. He opened it
tenderly, satisfied himself that the faded old rose that lay between the leaves was still intact,
and packed this treasure into the suit- case; then, while waiting for the north-bound train
to whistle for San Pasqual, he sat down at a little table and wrote a note to Donna:

Dear Miss Donnie:

I am sending you a thousand by Sam Singer. You might need it. Am in trouble and must get out
quick. Will stay away until things blow over. Hoping these few lines will find you feeling
well, as they leave me at present, I am,

Respect. yrs.

H. P. HENNAGE.

P. S. I came to say good-by a little while ago and was sorry you wasn't feeling well.

This note Mr. Hennage sealed carefully in an envelope, together with a compact little roll
of bills, just as the train whistled for San Pasqual. He seized his suit-case and hurried down
stairs, and on the way down he met Sam Singer coming up.

"Give this to Miss Donna" said Mr. Hennage, and thrust the envelope into the Indian's hand.
"Ain't got no time to talk to you, Sam. This is my busy day," and then, for the last time,
he gave Sam Singer the inevitable half dollar and a cigar.

"Good-by, Sam" he called as he descended the stairs. "Be a good Injun till I see you again."

He went to the ticket window, purchased a ticket to San Francisco and climbed aboard the train.
Two minutes later it pulled out. As it plunged into Tehachapi Pass, Mr. Hennage, standing on
the platform of the rear car, glanced back across the desert at San Pasqual.

"Nothin' like mystery to keep that rotten little camp up on its toes" he muttered. "I'll just
leave that mess to stew in its own juices for a while."

He went into the smoker and lit a cigar. His plans were well matured now and he was content;
in this comfortable frame of mind he glanced idly around at his fellow-passengers.

Seated two seats in front of him and on the opposite side of the coach, Mr. Hennage observed
a gray-haired man reading a newspaper. The gambler decided that there was something vaguely
familiar about the back of this passenger's head, and on the pretense of going to the front
of the car for a drink of water he contrived, on his way back to his seat, to catch a glimpse
of the stranger's face. At the same instant the man glanced up from his paper and nodded to
Mr. Hennage.

"How" said Harley P., and paused beside the other's seat. "Mr. T. Morgan Carey, if I ain't
mistaken?"

"The same" replied Carey in his dry, precise tones. "And you are--Mr.-- Mr.--Mr. Hammage."

"Hennage" corrected the gambler.

"I beg your pardon. Mr. Hennage. Quite so. Pray be seated, Mr. Hennage. You're the very man
I wanted to see."

He moved over and made room for Mr. Hennage beside him. The gambler sat down and sighed.

"Hot, ain't it?" he remarked, rather inanely.

"Rather. By the way, Mr. Hennage, have you, by any chance, seen that young man for whom I was
inquiring on the day I first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance? His name is McGraw--Robert
McGraw. You will recollect that I left with you one of my cards, with the request that you
give it to McGraw, should you meet him, and inform him that I desired to communicate with him."

"Yes" replied Mr. Hennage calmly. "I met him one day in San Pasqual an' gave him your card."

"You gave him my registered letter, also?"

So Carey had been talking with Miss Pickett again! Mr. Hennage nodded.

"Tell me, Mr. Hennage" purred Carey. "Why did the man, McGraw, send you to the post-office
with an order for that registered letter?"

"Oh, he was in a little trouble at the time an' didn't care to show in public" lied Mr. Hennage
glibly.

"I perceive. I believe you mentioned something about his reputation as a hard citizen when
I first spoke to you about him."

"Tougher'n a bob-cat" Mr. Hennage assured him, for no earthly reason except a desire to be
perverse and not contradict his former statements.

"Hu-u-m-m! I presume you know where Mr. McGraw may be found at present. Is he liable to communicate
with you?"

Mr. Hennage was on guard. "Well, I ain't sayin' nothin'" he replied evasively. It was in his
mind to discover, if possible, the details of the business which this man of vast emprise could
have with a penniless desert rat like Bob McGraw.

"Is this McGraw a friend of yours, Mr. Hennage?" pursued Carey.

"Well," the gambler fenced, "I've loaned him money."

"Ever get it back?" Carey smiled a thin sword-fish smile.

"Certainly. Why do you ask?"

"You consider McGraw honest?"

"Sure shot--between friends. Yes."

Carey turned his head slowly and gazed at the gambler in mean triumph. "Well, I'm sorry I can't
agree with you" he said. "Your friend McGraw robbed me of fifteen hundred dollars on the San
Pasqual-Keeler stage a few days ago."

The fact that Carey had been a victim of Bob McGraw's felonious activities was news to Mr.
Hennage, but he would not permit Carey to suspect it.

"Yes" he replied calmly, "I heard he'd taken to road work."

"He held up the stage" Carey repeated, in the flat tone of finality which the foreman of a
jury might have employed when repeating the verbal formula: "We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty, as charged."

"Then you recognized McGraw" ventured the gambler.

"The moment I saw him."

"That's funny" echoed Harley P. "I gathered from what you told me in San Pasqual that you two'd
never met up, an' they tell me that durin' the hold-up McGraw was behind a wall an' wearin'
a mask. You're sure some recognizer, Mr. Carey."

"We had met prior to the hold-up and subsequent to my conversation with you in San Pasqual."

"Still the bet goes as she lays" repeated Mr. Hennage. "For a near- sighted gent you're sure
some recognizer."

"I recognized his voice."

Mr. Hennage was silent for a minute. Carey continued.

"If the sheriff gets him, I'll see to it that McGraw doesn't rob another stage for some time
to come."

Still Mr. Hennage was silent. He was digesting the conversation, and this much he gathered:

There was some mysterious business afoot wherein Carey and Bob McGraw were jointly interested,
and they had met and quarreled over it, as evidenced by T. Morgan Carey's all too apparent
animosity. Mr. Hennage had a haunting suspicion that Carey's animus did not arise from the
fact that McGraw had robbed him of fifteen hundred dollars. He felt that there was a deeper,
more vital reason than that. All of his days Mr. Hennage had lived close to the primitive;
he was a shrewd judge of human impulses and it had been his experience that men quarrel over
two things--women and money. The possible hypothesis of a woman, in the suspected quarrel between
Bob McGraw and T. Morgan Carey, Harley P. dismissed as untenable. Remained then, only money--and
Bob McGraw had no money. His finances were at so low an ebb as to be beneath the notice of
such a palpable commercial wolf as T. Morgan Carey; consequently, and in the final analysis,
Mr. Hennage concluded that Bob McGraw possessed something which Carey coveted. Whether his
spiteful attitude toward the unfortunate Bob arose from this, or the loss of the fifteen hundred
dollars, Mr. Hennage now purposed discovering. He leaned toward Carey confidentially and lowered
his voice.

"Say, looky-here, Mr. Carey. This boy, McGraw, is a friend o' mine. A little wild? Yes. But
what young feller now-a-days ain't? I know he's robbed you o' fifteen hundred dollars, an'
I'm sorry for that, but I can fix you up all right. I'm goin' to get into communication with
our young friend before long, if he ain't beefed by the sheriff first, or captured alive--but
it's ten to one they get him, an' he'll be brought to trial. Well, now, here's what I'm drivin'
at. If the boy's nabbed, an' you'll agree to sorter, as the feller says, tangle the woof o'
memory an' refuse to swear that you recognize the said defendant as the hereinbefore mentioned
stage-robber, I'll see that you get your fifteen hundred back. This is his first serious job,
Mr. Carey, an' I wish you'd go easy on him. He ain't really bad."

T. Morgan Carey pounded the back of the seat in front of him.

"Not for fifty thousand dollars" he said. "The suggestion is preposterous. The man is a menace
to society and it is my duty to testify against him if he is apprehended."

"Then it ain't a question with you o' money back an' no questions asked?"

Carey shook his head emphatically. "It's principle" he said.

Mr. Hennage appeared chopfallen. In reality he was amused. Never before had Mr. Hennage met
a man to whom the abandonment of such "principle" would have been impossible under the terms
suggested. Clearly there was something wrong here. Mr. Hennage had met men to whom vengeance
would have been cheap at fifty thousand, but principle--the gambler shook his head. He had
lived long enough to learn that principle is a marketable commodity, and he was not deceived
in T. Morgan Carey's attitude of civic righteousness.

"Well, it's too bad you won't listen to reason, Mr. Carey" he said regretfully. "I thought
you might be willin' to go easy on the young feller. It's too durned bad," and he rose abruptly
and returned to his own seat. Carey resumed the perusal of his newspaper. He was not anxious
to continue the conversation, and he believed he had Mr. Hennage intimidated, and for reasons
of his own he was desirous of permitting the gambler to think matters over.

Mr. Hennage proceeded at once to think matters over. "Now, I wonder what that kid-glove crook
has against the boy!" he mused. "I can see right off that Bob has an ace coppered, an' this
sweet-scented burglar would like to see Bob tucked away in the calaboose while he goes huntin'
for the ace. What in Sam Hill can them two fellers have between them? Here's Bob, just a plain
young desert rat, a-dreamin' an' a- romancin' over the country, while this Carey is a solid
citizen. He's president o' the Inyo Land & Irrigation Company, according to his card. Bob ain't
got no money--Carey has a carload of it. Bob ain't got no water--Carey's in the irrigation
business. Bob ain't got no real estate, 'ceptin' what he accumulates on his person wanderin'
around, and Carey's got land--"

Mr. Hennage emitted a low soft whistle through the slit between two of his gold teeth.

 Harley P. Hennage, standing in line to register, noticed that Carey had filed
a telegram; consequently, when he had registered and T. Morgan Carey had disappeared into the
barber shop, Mr. Hennage, following up a strong winning "hunch," walked over to the telegraph
desk and laid a ten- dollar piece on the railing.

"I'm goin' to open a book, young lady" he announced. "I'm willin' to bet ten dollars that the
respectable old party that just give you a telegram signed Carey is wirin' about a friend o'
mine. If I don't guess right, you get the ten bucks. Fair?"

The young lady operator dimpled and admitted that it was eminently fair. She had no illusions
(although her position required her to have them) regarding the sacredness of privacy in a
telegram, and Mr. Hennage had not as yet asked her to violate a confidence.

"I'm a-bettin' ten bucks" repeated Mr. Hennage, "that the name McGraw occurs in that telegram."

"You win" the operator replied. "How did you guess it?"

"I was born with a veil" he replied. "I got the gift o' second sight, an' I'm just a-tryin'
it out. The ten is yours for a copy o' that telegram."

The operator seized a scratch-pad, copied the telegram and cautiously "slipped" it to Mr. Hennage,
who as cautiously "slipped" her the ten- dollar bill. He was rewarded for his prodigality by
the following:

R. P. McKeon, Mills Building, Sacramento, Calif.

Advise our friend approve McGraw applications at once. Letter follows.

CAREY.

The gambler smiled his thanks and walked across the hotel lobby to the public-telephone operator.
On this young lady's desk he laid a five- dollar bill.

"I want you to call up Sacramento on the long distance an' ask the central there to find out
who Mr. R. P. McKeon is an' what he does for a livin'."

"We have copies of the telephone directories of the principal cities in the state" came the
quick reply. "It makes it easier if we ask for the number direct."

"Five bucks for a look in the book" announced Mr. Hennage. He got the book, with the information
that he might have his look for nothing, but being a generous soul he declined. He ascertained
that R. P. McKeon was an attorney-at-law.

"As the feller says, I believe I see the light" murmured the gambler. "Now please get me the
agent for Wells Fargo & Company at San Pasqual."

When the operator informed him that San Pasqual was on the line, Mr. Hennage went into a sound-proof
booth and told a lie. He informed the agent at San Pasqual that he was the Bakersfield representative
of the Associated Press, and demanded the latest information regarding the hunt for the Garlock
bandit. He was informed that there was no news.

"I gotta get some news" he bellowed into the receiver. "What's the exact loss o' your company?"

"Twenty-one hundred eighty-three forty."

"Serves you right. How about the passengers? Got their names an' addresses an' the amounts
they lost?"

"No, but the express messenger has and he's in town. Hold the line a minute and I'll go call him."

So Mr. Hennage waited. Five minutes later, when he hung up, he had secured the information
and made careful note of it, after which he sought an arm-chair in the hotel window, planted
his feet on the window sill and gave himself up to reflection. He was occupied thus when T.
Morgan Carey came out of the barber shop, and seeing Mr. Hennage, came over and sat down beside
him. Mr. Hennage decided that the financier must have something on his mind, and he was not wrong.

"Mr. Hennage" said Carey unctuously, "I have been thinking over the proposition which you made
me coming up from San Pasqual this afternoon, and if you still feel inclined to act as intermediary
in this unfortunate affair, I will submit a proposition. Mr. McGraw may retain the fifteen
hundred dollars which he stole from me, and I will agree to give him, say, five thousand more,
through you, for a relinquishment to me of a water right which he has filed upon in the Sierra
overlooking Owens valley. There is also another matter of which McGraw has cognizance, and
he must agree to drop that too. His money will be delivered to you, for delivery to him. In
return, I will agree to be absent when his case comes to trial, should he be captured. I will
agree not to recognize him."

"But suppose he refuses this programme, Mr. Carey. Then what?"

"In that event, my dear Mr. Hennage" replied Carey coldly, "you may tell him from me that I
will spend a hundred thousand dollars to run him down. I will have this state combed by Pinkertons,
and when I land Mr. Robert McGraw I'll land him high and dry and it will be too late for him
to make me a proposition then. I have the power and the money necessary to get him--and I know
how."

"Well, what a long tail our cat's developing!" drawled Mr. Hennage. "Carey, you give me a pain
where I never knew it to ache me before. Now, you just sit still while I submit you a little
proposition. An' remember I ain't pleadin' with you to accept it. No, indeed. I'm just a-orderin'
you to. Bob McGraw can't prove that he didn't rob that stage, but a child could make a monkey
out o' you on the witness stand. Talked to him once an' recognized his voice, eh? Pooh! Met
him once an' recognized him masked. Rats! I happen to know, Carey, that you didn't recognize
the stage robber until after the messenger returned to the stage with his hat an' showed you
his name on the sweat-band. Then you remembered, because the wish was father to the thought,
an' you wanted the boy in jail. Now, looky here. I happen to be mighty heavily interested in
this here water right you're plannin' to blackmail McGraw out of. But you ain't got nothin'
on me, an' you can't buy me out for a million dollars, an' you ain't got money enough--there
ain't money enough in the world--to make me double-cross Bob McGraw just because he's a outlaw
from justice."

He tapped Carey on the knee with his fat forefinger. "I'm playin' look- out on this game, an'
it's hands off for you. You can't make a bet. You don't get that water right an' you won't
get the land; if Bob McGraw ain't on hand to sue for his rights, by the Nine Gods o' War, I'll
sue for him, an' I'll put up the money, an' I'll match you an' your gang for your shoe-strings,
and you're whipped to a frazzle, an' get that into your head--understand? You're figurin' now
on gettin' them applications approved, eh? Well, you just cut it out. If them applications
are approved before I'm ready to have 'em approved, you know what I'll do to you, Carey. I'll
cut your heart out. Don't you figure for a minute that there ain't somebody protectin' that
boy's bet. You scatter his chips an' see what happens to you. Understand? You try upsettin'
the Hennage apple-cart one o' these bright days, an' there'll be a rush order for a new tombstone.
The motto o' the Hennage family has allers been 'Hands Off Or Take The Consequences.' Of course,
if you insist, you can go to it with your private detectives, but you won't get far. You're
up against a double-jointed play, Carey. Look out for snags."

And stood he are simply has been pasqual and (under grade) in. lay that i lay.
 And knowing of the name under the sweat-band (for evidently it
was Bob's habit to brand all of his hats thus) and realizing that the finding of the hat would
divert suspicion from him, the outlaw had abandoned the hat without a fight!

As Harley P. Hennage would have put it, the entire situation was now as clear as mud!

"And to think that I even suspected him for a moment!" Donna wailed. "Oh, Bob, what will you
think of me! I'm a bad, worthless, disloyal wife. Oh, Bob, I'm so sorry and ashamed!"

She was, indeed. But sorrow and shame under such circumstances may exist, at the outset, for
about ten minutes. The resurgent wave of joy which her discovery induced quickly routed the
last vestige of her distress, and womanlike her first impulse, as a wife, was to wreak summary
vengeance on the man who had asserted that her husband had robbed the stage! The idea! She
would ascertain the name of this passenger who declared that he had recognized the bandit as
Bob McGraw, and force him to make a public apology--

No, she would not do that. To do so would be to presume that her Bob was not, like Caesar's
wife, above suspicion, and besides, it would spoil Harley P.'s little joke on San Pasqual.
And there was really no danger of Bob's arrest. The sheriff's posse was trailing the other
man out across the San Bernardino desert, while Bob, serenely unconscious of the furor created
by the finding of his lost hat, was trudging through the range, miles to the north, headed
east from Coso Springs with his two burros, circling across country to the Colorado desert
and prospecting as he went. Her defense of him when he needed none would merely serve to invite
the query: "Why are you so interested in him!" and until the day of Bob's return, she did not
wish to answer "Because he is my husband."

No, it would be far better to sit calmly by and enjoy the industry of the man-hunters; then,
when Bob returned, he would defend himself in his own vigorous fashion, much to the chagrin
of his accusers and the consequent delight of Harley P. Hennage.

Thinking of Mr. Hennage reminded her that he had sent a note by Sam Singer. In her distress
she had forgotten about it until now; so, after bathing her eyes, she opened the envelope and
acquainted herself with its remarkable contents.

Poor old Harley P.! She read the distress between the lines of that kindly lie that he was
in trouble and had to get out of San Pasqual-- and as she fingered the little roll of bills
she discovered no paradox in Harley P.'s hard face and still harder reputation and the oft-
repeated biblical quotation that God makes man to His own image and likeness.

 A thousand dollars! How well she knew why he had sent it! He feared
that she, like him, would have to leave San Pasqual to avoid answering
questions, and fearing that she was but indifferently equipped to face
the world, he had refrained from asking questions. Instead he had
equipped her, and in his unassuming way had departed without waiting
for her thanks or leaving an address--infallible evidence that he
desired neither her gratitude nor the return of the money.

"Poor fellow!" she murmured. "How terrible he'll feel when he discovers it's all a mistake.
He'll be ashamed to speak to me. Still, why should he feel chagrined at all? He hasn't said
a word."

Foxy Mr. Hennage! It was quite true. He hadn't said a word! Ah, money talks; despite his precautions,
Harley P.'s thousand dollars were very eloquent.

The next day Donna took up her life where it had left off. She had scarcely cached Harley P.'s
thousand dollars in her private compartment in the eating-house safe when the irrepressible
Miss Molly Pickett dropped in to express her sympathy at Donna's three-day illness, casually
mentioned the stage robbery, the name in the hat and the sudden exit from San Pasqual of Harley
P. Hennage. Incidentally she mentioned the fact that Mr. Hennage had once presented her with
an order for a registered letter for a man by the name of Robert McGraw, and taking into consideration
this fact and the further fact that birds of a feather always flock together, Miss Pickett
opined that the hold- up man was doubtless a bosom friend of Mr. Hennage.

A hearty dinner the evening before, and twelve hours of uninterrupted slumber, had driven from
Donna's face every trace of her three days of purgatory. She was alert, smiling and happy;
and able to cross swords with Miss Pickett with something more than a gossamer hope of foiling
her. She discussed the affair so calmly and with such apparent interest that Miss Pickett was
completely mystified, and in a last desperate effort to satiate her curiosity she cast aside
all pretense and came boldly into the open.

"Folks do say, Donna, that the man who was shot saving you from those tramps and was nursed
at the Hat Ranch is the same man that held up the stage."

"Indeed! Miss Pickett, folks don't know what they are talking about. Have you asked Doctor Taylor?"

Miss Pickett commenced to spar. As a matter of fact she had asked Doc Taylor, and been informed
that his late patient responded to the name of Roland McGuire. But there was a hang-dog look
in the doctor's eyes which had not escaped Miss Pickett, and intuitively she knew that the
worthy medico had lied. Donna's question convinced her that she was not mistaken. Her bright
little eyes gleamed archly.

"Why, we never did learn who it was that saved you, Donna. Is it a secret?"

"Why, no."

Miss Pickett waited in agony for ten seconds, but Donna, having replied fully to her query,
volunteered no further information. In desperation the post-mistress demanded:

"Well, then, why do you keep it to yourself?"

"Is that any of your business, Miss Pickett?"

"No, of course not. But then--"

"Well?"

Miss Pickett was non-plussed, but only for an instant. Like all old maids when bested in a
battle of wits by an opponent of their own sex, younger, more attractive and known to be popular
with the males of their acquaintance, Miss Pickett was quick to take the high ground of a tactful
consideration of circumstances which Donna apparently had overlooked; circumstances which,
while savoring slightly of girlish indiscretion, might, nevertheless, be construed as a distinct
slip from virtue. An attack, whether by innuendo or direct assertion, on a sister's virtue
is ever the first weapon of a mean and disappointed woman, and having no other charms to speak
of, Miss Pickett chose to assume that of superior virtue; so, with the subtle sting of her
species, she sunk her poison home.

"Well, Donna, if you won't protect your own good name, I'm sure you shouldn't be surprised
if your friends endeavor to protect it for you. Everybody in town knows you kept that man at
your home for a month--"

"I haven't denied it, or attempted to conceal the fact. In what manner does that reflect on
my good name, Miss Pickett?"

"Well, folks will talk--you know that."

"Of course I know they will. That's their privilege, Miss Pickett, and I'm not at all interested,
I assure you." She smiled patronizingly at the postmistress. "When I want somebody to protect
my good name, Miss Pickett, I'll send for a man. Until then you may consider yourself relieved
of the task."

"Well, when people know you've kept a desperate character--"

"Who knows it, Miss Pickett? Do you?"

Miss Pickett was forced to acknowledge that she did not, and under a hot volley of questions
from Donna admitted further that not a soul in San Pasqual had even hinted to her of such a
contingency. Too late the spinster realized that she had, figuratively speaking, placed all
of her eggs in one bucket and scrambled them.

Donna realized it too. For the first time in her life she was angry, although not for worlds
would she permit Miss Pickett to realize it. She had the postmistress on the defensive now,
and she was determined to keep her there; so, in calm gentle commiserating tones Donna read
the riot act to the embarrassed gossip. Mentally, morally, physically and socially, she was
Miss Pickett's superior and Miss Pickett knew this; her instinctive knowledge of it placed
her at a disadvantage and forced her to listen to a few elegantly worded remarks on charity,
the folly of playing the part of guardian of a sister's morals and the innate nastiness of
throwing mud. It was a rare grueling that Donna gave Miss Pickett; the pity of it was that
Mr. Hennage could not have been there to listen to it.

The postmistress was confounded. She could think of nothing to say in reply until the right
moment for saying it had fled; and her pride forbade her acknowledging defeat by tossing her
head and walking out with a grand air of injured innocence. In the end she lost her composure
entirely, for while Donna's remarks had seemed designed for the "folks" whom Miss Pickett seemed
to fear might "talk," the latter knew that in reality they were directed at her.

To be forced to listen to an almost motherly castigation from Donna Corblay was too great a
tax upon Miss Pickett's limited powers of endurance. She flew into a rage, all the more pitiful
because it was impotent, murmured something about the ingratitude of some people--"not mentionin'
any names, but not exceptin' present company," and swept out of the eating-house; not, however,
until she had commenced to cry, thus acknowledging her defeat and humiliation and presenting
to San Pasqual that meanest of all mean sights, a mean old maid, in a rage, weeping until her
eyes and nose are red.

In the afternoon Donna had a visit from a Wells Fargo & Company detective. He was a large fatherly
person, who might have had girls of his own as old as Donna, and he stated his mission without
embarrassment of preliminary verbal skirmishing. "From various sources around town, Miss Corblay,
I gather that it is quite possible you are acquainted with the man McGraw who is suspected
of the recent stage robbery at Garlock."

Donna admitted, smiling, that it was quite possible.

"Have you any objection to telling me all you know about him?"

"Not the slightest. It is your business to investigate this matter, and I have refrained from
telling others whose business it is not. If I have your word of honor that what I tell you
is for the company you represent and not for the gossips of San Pasqual, I can save you time
and trouble and expense."

"Thank you. It is a rare pleasure, I assure you, Miss Corblay, for a man in my line of work
to receive such a prompt, courteous and businesslike answer from a woman. You have my word
that anything you tell me is in confidence."

"Did Miss Pickett send you here?"

"Indirectly. She gave some information to our express messenger who in turn gave it to me.
I might add that the interest of our messenger ceased when I took up this case."

"Very well" replied Donna, and proceeded to tell him with infinite detail, everything she knew
concerning Bob McGraw, excepting the fact that he was her husband. In five minutes she had
tightened the web of circumstantial evidence around him, and then unloosened it, and at the
finish of her recital the detective had no questions to ask. He held out his hand and shook
hers warmly.

"I think you have solved this case for me, Miss Corblay. However, there is one matter that
will be hard to overcome, and that is the identification of McGraw by the passenger, Carey."

"Who?"

"A passenger. His name is T. Morgan Carey, of Los Angeles. He is rather prominent in business
circles--a pretty sane, careful man, and his testimony would have considerable evidence with
a jury."

"Find out from the messenger if Carey identified Bob--I mean Mr. McGraw (the detective smiled
slightly) before the messenger gave chase to the hold-up man, or after he returned with the
hat. If the latter, I can explode his testimony. I happen to know that Mr. Carey is a business
rival of Mr. McGraw's and very unfriendly to him. It would be to Carey's great financial advantage
to see Bob (again the detective smiled) in jail. Then ask your agent at Keeler to make inquiry
and learn if a tall young man with auburn hair didn't ride into town the day following the
hold-up, mounted on a roan horse. If he sold the horse, saddle and spurs, purchased two burros
and outfitted in Keeler for a prospecting trip, that man was Mr. Robert McGraw and he didn't
arrive bareheaded. I think you'll discover that you're following a false lead."

The detective could guess a thing or two; otherwise he would not have been a detective. He
guessed something of Donna's more than friendly interest in the man he was after; an interest
which he felt to be greater than a mere feeling of gratitude for what McGraw had saved her
from, and his sympathies wore with her. She had been "open and above board with him" and he
appreciated the embarrassment that might attend should the matter be given publicity.

"Whatever I discover will not be made public, Miss Corblay. Thank you."

He lifted his hat and walked out, while Donna, selecting one of the late magazines from the
news-stand, sat down and read for the rest of the afternoon.

Eight days passed before the detective appeared again at the counter.

"Miss Corblay," he reported smiling, "you're a better detective than I. McGraw didn't do the
job--that is, your--Bob. But some other McGraw did. The fact is, he's sent back the money he
lifted from the company and the passengers. At least, a number of them have reported the return
of their cash. Here's a note the agent here received a little while ago."

He passed a type-written sheet across the counter to her. Donna read it carefully.

"The plot thickens. However, this is only added proof that my line of reasoning is correct.
This line, 'I didn't have no business to do it in the first place,' clinches the testimony.
The Robert McGraw of my acquaintance never uses double negatives."

"And he couldn't have arrived in Goldfield with a burro train in less than six weeks. You say
this man uses double negatives. There's a clew. Who, among your acquaintances, Miss Corblay,
uses double negatives?"

"Every soul with the exception of Mr. McGraw" replied Donna. "Following a clew like that in
San Pasqual would be like looking for a needle in a haystack. But I think I could name the
man who wrote that note."

"Who is he?"

Donna favored the detective with a mocking little smile.

"He's a friend of mine" she said, "and I never go back on a friend."

"Well," he replied jokingly, "I can't imagine a friend going back on you. However, I'll not
be curious about this chap. He appears contrite, and the incident is closed. But all the same,
this is one of the queerest cases I've had in all my experience," and he went out, still puzzled.

CHAPTER XVIII

Thanksgiving came and went, and with, the approach of Christmas came the knowledge to Donna
that her tour of duty behind the cash-counter of the eating-house was rapidly drawing to a
close--for the very sweetest reason in all this sad old world; a reason as yet apparent to
no one in San Pasqual but Donna herself; a very tiny reason against whose coming Donna had
commenced to plan and sew in the lonely hours of her vigil at the Hat Ranch, waiting for Bob
to come back, that she might impart to him the secret. Yes, indeed, a most valid reason. Donna
hoped it would be a man-baby, with wavy auburn hair like Bob's.

On the first of February she gave notice of her intention to resign her position on the first
of the following month. Bob had left with her a hundred and fifty dollars, the balance of her
little capital having been expended during their honeymoon trip and in outfitting Bob for his
trip into the desert, and but for the fact that the thousand dollars so thoughtfully provided
by Harley P. was still in the eating-house safe, Donna would have been placed in a most embarrassing
position. With the knowledge that she had ample funds with which to maintain herself and her
dependents at the Hat Ranch until the birth of her child, however, Donna decided to remove
herself from the prying gaze of the San Pasqualians by resigning her position. The fact that
her marriage to Bob was not known in the little town was now an added embarrassment, and the
necessity of conveying to the world the news that she had been married since October was imperative.
She decided to go up to Bakersfield, visit the city hall and request the clerk who had issued
the license to Bob and herself to give the news of its issuance to the papers. She was aware
that Bob knew this clerk and for that reason they had been enabled to keep the matter secret.

borne his rightfulness and mrs.
 Borax himself was not a bad-looking fellow, in a rough
out-o'-doors sort of way, and while he had not been privileged to a close scrutiny of the man
whom Donna had kissed, still he believed him to be a rough-and- ready individual like himself,
and quite naturally the thought occurred to Borax that he, too, might not have been unwelcome,
had he but possessed sufficient courage to make a cautious advance.

He was confirmed in this thought now at the news which he heard upon the first night of his
return to San Pasqual, and with the thought that he had been worshiping an idol with feet of
clay, Mr. O'Rourke cursed himself for an unmitigated jackass in thus leaving to some other
roving rascal the prize which he had so earnestly desired for himself. With the receipt of
the information about Donna, Mr. O'Rourke unconsciously felt himself instantly on the same
social level with her, and since convention was something alien to his soul, and possession
his sole inspiration, he decided that he could make his advances now in full confidence that
he might be successful; and if not, there would be no necessity for feeling sheepish over his
rebuff.

"I'll ask her to marry me, an' damn the odds" he decided. "There's worse places than the Hat
Ranch to live in, with a few dollars always comin' in. She'll be glad enough of the offer,
like as not--considerin' the circumstances, an' she can send the kid to an orphan asylum."

By morning this crafty idea had taken full possession of Borax, so after fortifying himself
with a half dozen drinks, he set forth for the Hat Ranch. Also, under the influence of the
liquor and his overweening pride in his bright idea, he had taken pains to announce his destination
and the object of his visit. A crowd of male observers stood on the porch of the Silver Dollar
saloon and watched him depart, the while they spurred him on his way with many a jeer and jibe.

Sam Singer was seated in the kitchen at the Hat Ranch, enjoying an after-breakfast cigarette,
when O'Rourke came to the kitchen door, hiccoughed and made rough demand for the mistress of
the house. Donna, from an adjoining room, heard him and came into the kitchen.

"Well, Borax" she demanded, "what do you want? A hat?"

She saw that he had been drinking, and a sudden fear took possession of her. With the exception
of her Indian retainer, Bob McGraw, Harley P. Hennage and Doc Taylor, no male foot had profaned
the Hat Ranch in twenty years, and the presence of O'Rourke was a distinct menace.

"Not on your life, sweetheart" he began pertly, "I want you."

Donna spoke to the Indian in the Cahuilla tongue, and Sam Singer sprang at the mule-skinner
like a panther on an unsuspecting deer. The lean mahogany-colored hands closed around the ruffian's
throat, and the two bodies crashed to the floor together. O'Rourke, taken unaware by the suddenness
and ferocity of the attack, was no match. for the Indian. He endeavored to free his arm and
reach for his gun, but Sam Singer had anticipated him. Already the big blue gun was in the
Indian's possession; he raised it, brought the butt down on O'Rourke's head, and the battle
was over, almost before it had fairly started.

"Drag him outside" Donna commanded. The Indian grasped O'Rourke by his legs and dragged him
outside the compound. Then he returned to the kitchen, secured a bucket, filled it at the artesian
well, and returning, dashed it over the still dazed enemy.

The water did its work, and presently O'Rourke sat up.

"I'll kill you for this" he said; whereat Sam Singer struck him in the face and rolled him
over in the dirt. Incidentally, he retained Mr. O'Rourke's big blue gun as a souvenir of the fray.

Half an hour later a very dejected, bedraggled mule-skinner, bruised, bleeding and covered
with sand which clung to his dripping person, returned to San Pasqual, to be heartily jeered
at for the result of his pilgrimage; for the San Pasqualians noticed that not only had Mr.
O'Rourke suffered defeat, but in the melee his gun had been taken from him, and to suffer such
humiliation at the hands of a mere Indian was considered in San Pasqual the very dregs and
drainings of downright disgrace.

For two days Borax O'Rourke drowned his chagrin in the lethal waters of the Silver Dollar saloon,
and presently to him here there came an anonymous letter, containing, by some devil's devising,
a unique scheme for revenge on Donna, and on Sam Singer, who depended on her bounty. At one
stroke he could destroy them both, and cast them forth into the wide reaches of the Mojave
desert, homeless.

The unknown writer of this anonymous note desired to advise Borax O'Rourke that Donna Corblay
had no title to the lands on which the Hat Ranch stood; that the desert was still part of the
public domain and subject to entry; that he, Borax O'Rourke, might file on forty acres surrounding
the Hat Ranch, and by demonstrating that he had an artesian well on the forty, which would
irrigate one-eighth of his entry, he could obtain title to the land. In any event, after filing
his application, he would then be in a position to evict his enemies.

This seemed to the brute O'Rourke such a very novel idea that he decided to follow it out immediately.
He spent that day sobering up, and the next few days in a trip to the land office one hundred
and fifty miles up the valley; at Independence. Upon his return to San Pasqual he had old Judge
Kenny, the local justice of the peace, serve formal written notice upon Donna Corblay to evacuate
immediately; otherwise he would commence suit.

The news was over San Pasqual in an hour, and formed the basis of much discussion in the Silver
Dollar when Borax Somebody hailed him.

"Well, Borax, I see you're goin' to play even. D'ye think you'll be able to oust the girl from
the Hat Ranch? The boys have been discussin' it, and it looks like she might put up a fight
on squatter's rights."

"I'll git her out all right" rumbled O'Rourke, "an' when I do, I'll chuck the old lady's bones
after her. I'll teach her an' that Indian o' hers--"

Borax O'Rourke paused. His tongue clicked drily against the roof of his mouth.

Seated at a card-table across the room, idly shuffling a deck of cards, sat Harley P. Hennage,
and he was staring at Borax O'Rourke. At the latter's sudden pause, a silence fell upon the
Silver Dollar, and every man lined up at the long bar turned and followed O'Rourke's glance.

For fully a minute Mr. Hennage's small baleful eyes flicked murder lights as their glance burned
into O'Rourke's wolfish soul. Then, quite calmly, he commenced placing his cards for a game
of solitaire, and when he had carefully disposed of them he spoke:

"O'Rourke!"

The word was deep, throaty, almost a growl. Simultaneously the men nearest O'Rourke drifted
quickly away from him.

"Well?"

"I don't like your game. Stop it. Hand me an assignment o' that desert entry o' yours by three
o'clock, an' get out o' town by four o'clock. Hear me?"

"An' if I don't?" demanded O'Rourke.

"If you don't," repeated Mr. Hennage calmly, "I shall cancel the entry at one minute after
four o'clock."

"You can't bluff me."

"I'm not bluffin' this time, you dog. Do I get that assignment of entry?"

Borax O'Rourke knew that his life might be the price of a refusal, but in the presence of that
crowd where men were measured by their courage the remnants of his manhood forbade him to answer
"yes." He was not a coward.

"I'll be in the middle o' the street at four o'clock" he answered.

"Got a gun?"

"No."

The gambler threw him over a twenty-dollar piece.

"Go get one."

Borax O'Rourke picked the coin off the floor and shuffled out of the Silver Dollar saloon.

Until one minute past four o'clock, then, the incident was closed, and Mr. Hennage returned
to his interrupted game of solitaire.

CHAPTER XIX

Why Harley P. Hennage should elect to return to San Pasqual on the very day that Borax O'Rourke
issued formal written notice through old Judge Kenny for Donna to vacate the Hat Ranch, which
stood upon the desert land whereon he had filed, is one of the mysteries of retributive justice
with which this story has nothing to do. Suffice the fact that Mr. Hennage had stayed away
from San Pasqual six months, and six months is a sufficient lapse of time for any ordinary
public excitement to wear off, particularly in the desert. He had not intended returning so
soon, but a letter from Dan Pennycook, to whom Mr. Hennage had communicated his whereabouts,
charging the yardmaster to keep him in touch with affairs at the Hat Ranch, had precipitated
his descent upon San Pasqual. He had dropped off the Limited at daylight that very morning,
and by nine o'clock was in possession of all the facts regarding the mistress of the Hat Ranch.

"It's a nasty mix-up, Harley" Dan Pennycook informed him, when Mr. Hennage sought the yardmaster
out in his desire for explicit information touching the hint of trouble to Donna conveyed in
the letter which Pennycook had sent him. "Her husband ain't never showed up, an' there ain't
no record of her marriage license in the county clerk's office."

"How d'ye know there ain't?" the gambler demanded.

"Ee--er--well, the fact is, Harley, Mrs. Pennycook--"

"She went an' looked, eh?"

"Well, she was concerned about the girl's reputation--"

"Huh-huh. I see. Dan, do you believe this scandal?"

"Not a damned word of it" said honest Dan firmly. "There's some mistake. The girl's good. I've
seen her grow up in this town since she was a baby, an' girls like Donna Corblay don't go wrong."

Mr. Hennage extended his freckled, hairy hand. "Dan" he said, "I thank you for that. But your
missus ain't playin' fair."

Pennycook threw up his hands deprecatingly. "I know it" he said, "an' I can't help it."

Harley P. laid his hand on the yardmaster's shoulder. "Dan" he said, "me an' you've been good
friends, man to man, an' there's just a chance that after to-day we ain't a-goin' to meet no
more. You take my compliments to Mrs. Pennycook, Dan, an' tell her that I've kept my word,
even if she didn't keep hers. That worthless convict brother-in- law o' yours is dead, Dan.
You can quit worryin'. He'll never blackmail you again. He's as dead as a mackerel an' I seen
him buried. Dan, old friend, adios."

He shook hands warmly with the yardmaster and walked over to the Silver Dollar saloon, where,
in order to smother his distress, he played game after game of solitaire. Here, shortly after
his arrival, he had learned of Borax O'Rourke's latest move, and when the latter entered the
saloon an hour later, Harley P. had delivered his ultimatum.

For an hour after O'Rourke had left the Silver Dollar for the ostensible purpose of purchasing
a gun, the gambler continued to play solitaire. At three o'clock he arose, kicked back his
chair, sighed, and glanced at the crowd which had been hanging around, watching him.

"Twenty games to-day an' never beat it once" he complained. Engineering did not necessitate activity

 Dan Pennycook had made all of the funeral arrangements, and when the crowd had passed
slowly around the casket, viewing Harley P.'s placid face for the last time, a strange young
man, clad in the garb of a prospector, mounted the little dais, so long occupied by the lookout
for Harley P.'s faro game, and delivered a funeral oration. It was not a panegyric of hope,
and it dwelt not with the promise of a haven for the gambler's soul in one of his Father's
many mansions. He told them merely the story of one who had dwelt amongst them--the story of
a man they had never known-- and he told it in such simple, eloquent words that the men of
San Pasqual wondered what dark tragedy underlay his own life, that he must needs descend to
mingle with such as they. And wondering, they wept.

They asked each other who this red stranger might be, but none could answer. But when Harley
P. Hennage was finally consigned to the desert they watched the stranger and saw him walk down
the tracks to the Hat Ranch. Then they understood, and the word was passed that the man was
Bob McGraw, the father of Donna Corblay's unborn child.

Strange to relate, nobody considered it worth while to telephone the sheriff of Kern county.
Even Miss Pickett, who since the shooting had been strangely subdued, was not attracted by
the recollection of the offer of a reward of five hundred dollars for Bob McGraw, dead or alive;
and ten days after the funeral, when a registered letter came to Robert McGraw, she sent for
Dan Pennycook, gave him the letter and the registry receipt and asked him to take it down to
the Hat Ranch.

Pennycook leaned his greasy elbows on the delivery window and gazed long and sternly at Miss
Pickett.

"Miss Pickett" he said presently, "we found a 'nononymous letter on Borax O'Rourke after he
was killed. There's folks in San Pasqual that says the letter's in your handwritin'."

"'Tain't so!" shrilled the spinster.

"Well, this man McGraw says it is so, an' he's goin' to get an expert to prove it. He says
it's a felony to send a 'nonymous letter through the United States mails. I'm just a-tellin'
you to give you fair warnin'."

Miss Pickett, although greatly agitated, pursed her mouth contemptuously and closed the delivery
window. Mr. Pennycook left for the Hat Ranch.

"Donna," said Bob McGraw, when Dan Pennycook had departed, after delivering the letter from
the State Land Office, "the applications of my clients are approved and ready to be passed
to patent. I have been called upon to pay the balance of thirty-nine thousand dollars due on
the land, and if there are thirty-nine cents real money in this world, I do act possess them.
Will you loan me a hundred dollars, dear, from that thousand Harley P. gave you? I must go
to San Francisco on business."

He smiled his old bantering smile. "I'm always broke, sweetheart. I'm an unfortunate cuss,
am I not? Those claims of mine didn't yield wages and I was forced to sell my outfit at Danby
to get railroad fare back to San Pasqual. And if the train hadn't been ten minutes late--if
I hadn't gone into the eating-house looking for you--I would, have arrived in time to have
saved poor Hennage. It was my fight, after all, and poor Harley wasn't used to firearms."

They were sitting together in the patio. Donna leaned her head on his broad shoulder. She had
suffered much of late. She had fought the good fight for his sake, for the sake of his great
dream of Donnaville, and she had fought alone. She was weary of it all and she longed to leave
San Pasqual as quickly as possible.

"Are you going to ask Mr. Dunstan for the thirty-nine thousand dollars he promised to loan
you, when the lands were ready for you?" she asked dully.

"No" he answered. "It's no use. I need more money, and Dunstan's check wouldn't even get me
started. If I'm whipped, there is no sense in dragging my friends down with me. I'm going to
Los Angeles and compromise with Carey."

She drew his rough cheek down to hers and patted his brown hands. She knew then the bitterness
of his defeat, and she made no comment. She was tired of the fight. A compromise with Carey
or a sale of the water right was their only hope, and when Bob spoke of compromise she was
too listless to dissuade him. Since that eventful night when he had first ridden into San Pasqual
she had been more or less of a stormy petrel; woe and death and suffering had followed his
coming, and if Donnaville was to be purchased at such a price, the land was dear, indeed.

She gave him gladly of her slender hoard and that night Bob McGraw went up to San Francisco.
Two days later he returned, stopping off at Bakersfield, and the following morning he returned
to San Pasqual.

He went at once to the post-office, and after receiving permission from Miss Pickett, screwed
into the wall of the post-office lobby what appeared to Miss Pickett to be two pictures, framed. I mcgraw
t suffices here? Did i do aught and what you bade me said themselves, but anything in it
welcome? Did you have not state me that her work was covered through die for which you? Did
you have not marry she mcgraw, thereat, period, to he impressed so for king, before has therein

Your glory demand a refinisher, please Charivari,
but incaution. Him is soberly so has been removed in women in toe,

.
 He requested an interview at ten o'clock the following morning for the purpose
of adjusting a compromise with him.

Needless to state, Mr. T. Morgan Carey granted the request with cheerful alacrity.

"I'm coming to do business" Bob warned him. "No third parties around-- understand!"

"Certainly, certainly" responded Carey. "And in order to save time, Mr. McGraw, I'll have the
assignment of your water right made out, ready for your signature. I'll have a notary within
hailing distance."

Bob could hear him chuckling as he hung up, for to Carey the thought of his revenge on the
man who had cuffed him in the State Land Office was very sweet, indeed. His amiable smile had
not yet worn off when his office boy ushered Bob McGraw into his private office at ten o'clock
next morning. He waved Bob to a chair and looked him over curiously.

"Been too busy lately to dress up, eh?" he queried, as he noted Bob's corduroy trousers tucked
into his miner's boots.

"Pretty busy" assented Bob, and smiled.

"Rather spectacular removal--that of our friend Hennage" Carey continued. "From what I learn
he was a little slow on the draw."

"O'Rourke beat him to it."

"If I may judge by the single exhibition of your proficiency with a gun which I was privileged
to observe, Mr. McGraw, the issue would have been different had you been in Hennage's boots."

"Possibly. But I didn't come here to gossip with you, Carey. I don't like you well enough for
that. I want to finish my business and get back to San Pasqual to-night."

"Certainly, certainly. But you're such an extraordinary young man, McGraw, that in spite of
our former differences I must own to a desire to know more about you. I could use a man with
your brains and ability, McGraw. You're the kind of a fellow I've been looking for--for a great
many years, in fact. If you think you could manage to divorce yourself from your ambitions
to supersede me in the State Land Office, I could afford to pay you a fat salary to attend
to my land matters. I would have to be the boss, however. It has been a rule of my life, McGraw,
to gather about me men with more brains than I possess myself. That is the secret of my--er--rather
modest success."

Bob smiled. "No use" he answered. "I couldn't wear your collar, Carey. I Ve been a white man
all my life and I'm too old to change."

"It's a pity" Carey replied with genuine sincerity. "I can see remarkable possibilities in
you, McGraw. I can, indeed. It's a shame to see you waste your opportunities."

"Play ball" commanded Bob sharply.

"Very well, since you desire it. In the matter of those applications for fifty sections of
Owens Valley: you have received a notification from the Registrar of the State Land Office,
advising you to call and pay thirty-nine thousand dollars. You cannot pay it; neither can your
clients. What are you going to do about it?"

Bob shrugged. "Quien sabe?" he said.

"Well, Mr. McGraw, I'll tell you. Your applications are going to lapse through non-payment,
and I'm going to get the land. So enough of that. You own a valuable water right. I'm going
to get that also. Do you wish me to explain why?"

"No, it is not necessary. I think I follow your line of reasoning."

"I am not disappointed in my estimate of your common sense" Carey retorted, and favored his
visitor with a cold, quizzical smile. "Here is the assignment of that water right to me. In
return I will give you --let me see. I will give you just fifteen hundred dollars for that
water right, McGraw, and I am surprised at myself for exhibiting such generosity. And inasmuch
as you collected that sum in advance last autumn at Garlock, your signature to the assignment,
before a notary who is waiting in the next room, is all that we require to terminate this interview."

"But I told you I came here to compromise."

"I understand fully. Those are my terms. Your water right on Cottonwood lake in return for
your freedom. Stage-robbers cannot be choosers, Mr. McGraw. I recognized you that day at Garlock
and I am prepared to so testify."

The land-grabber rose from his swivel chair. His polished suave manner had disappeared now
and his cold eyes flashed with anger and hatred.

"I haven't forgotten that day in the State Land Office, McGraw. A slight pressure on this button"--he
placed his manicured finger on an ivory push button--"and two plain-clothes men in my outer
office will attend to your case, McGraw."

"So those are your final terms, Carey?"

"Absolutely."

Bob crossed his right leg over his left knee, pulled out a five-cent cigar and thoughtfully
bit off the end.

"Press the button, old man" he murmured presently. "Confound this cigar, I've busted the blamed
wrapper. Got another cigar handy, Carey? Thanks. By George, that's a two-bitter, isn't it?
Well, it's none too good for the last of the McGraw family. I'll be in the two-bit class; myself
in half an hour. But proceed, Carey. Press the button and call in your plain-clothes men."

He pulled back the lapel of his coat, and the land-grabber saw the butt of a gun nestling under
his left arm. From his inner coat pocket Bob drew a cylindrical roll of paper about eight inches
long.

Carey eyed him scornfully. "This is the city of Los Angeles, my friend, not the open desert
at Garlock. A gunplay would be most ill-advised, I assure you."

"Oh, that's just part of my wardrobe" Bob retorted. "I wouldn't think of using that on a man
unless he was real dangerous--and men like you are beneath my notice. Come now, Carey. Which
is it to be? Compromise or the penitentiary?"

"Certainly not compromise--on any terms but mine."

"Well, press the button and call them in--Boston!"

Carey whirled in his chair, jerked open a drawer in his desk and reached his hand inside. Before
he could withdraw it Bob McGraw's big automatic was covering him.

"Take your hand out of that drawer--Boston. Out, you dog, or I'll drill you!"

Carey's hand came out of the drawer slowly, very slowly, grasping a small pearl-handled revolver.

"This is the city of Los Angeles, my friend, and not the open desert. A gun-play would be most
ill-advised, I assure you" Bob mocked the land- grabber. "You'd better let me have that pop-gun."

He gently removed the little weapon from Carey's trembling hand.

"Now, go over in that corner and sit down--no, not on the floor. Take a chair with you. I'll
occupy the arsenal. You might have all kinds of push buttons, burglar alarms and deadly weapons
around this desk."

He ran his hands lightly over Carey's person in search of weapons, shoved him into the corner
indicated, then turned and snapped the spring lock on the door leading out to the general office;
after which he laid his gun on Carey's desk, sat down in Carey's swivel chair, tilted himself
back and lifted his hob-nailed miner's boots to the top of Carey's rosewood table close by.
And as he gazed, almost sorrowfully, at the land-grabber, he puffed enjoyably at Carey's cigar.
Evidently he foresaw a lengthy argument and meant to make himself comfortable before proceeding.

"Well, now, Boston, since we have definitely located you as the murderer of Oliver Corblay
in the Colorado desert on the night of May 17th, 188-, I'll give you five minutes to get your
nerve back and then we'll get down to business. You will recall that I came here to compromise."

was the only human being I have ever met that I could trust implicitly. He was your partner
and he warned me to keep off. He meant it, and I knew he meant it--so I stayed off. Do you
think, McGraw, that I would have let you beat me out of that land if it hadn't been for Hennage?
I didn't dare rush those selections through for patent until he was dead--and then it was too
late. Had you left your affairs in any other hands I would have crushed you, but Hennage could
not be bought. I didn't even try. He was above a price."

"Is that why you failed to act immediately after you became convinced that I was an outlaw
and would not dare claim the land when it should be granted to my clients?" demanded Bob.

Carey nodded. "I met Hennage in Bakersfield, and he told me to keep my hands off those applications."

"Then he bluffed you, Mr. Carey. Harley P. Hennage was my friend, but not my partner. He did
not have five cents invested in my scheme. I never mentioned it to him, and neither did my
wife. His threat was a bluff, and where he got his information of my land deal is a mystery,
the solution of which perished with Harley P."

Carey sat in his chair, with his head bowed. He was clasping and unclasping his fingers in
a manner pathetically suggestive of helplessness.

"I don't understand" he mumbled. "He told me to keep off and I kept off." He sighed. "I'd have
given a million dollars for a friend like him. I--I--never--had--one."

Bob McGraw drew T. Morgan Carey's mortgage from his pocket, scratched a match on his trouser-leg
and held it under the fluttering leaves. Slowly the little flame mounted, and when it threatened
to scorch his fingers the promoter of Donnaville tossed the blazing fragments into a convenient
cuspidor. He looked up and saw Carey regarding him curiously.

"That was your mortgage" the land-grabber said wonderingly. "You have burned half a million
dollars."

"I was selling you my friendship--at cut rates, Mr. Carey. I was worthy of Hennage's trust
and friendship until a few minutes ago. Harley P. Hennage never did a mean or a cowardly act,
and to-day I used my power over you to extort half a million dollars from you to further a
scheme of mine. I figured that the end justified the means. It did not, and I ask you to forgive
me."

Carey smiled wanly. "It's up-hill work, McGraw, but I'll forgive you. What great scheme is
this of yours that caused you to appear unworthy of the friend who was so worthy of you? I
have a great curiosity to understand you. Who knows? Perhaps I may end up by liking you?"

And then Bob McGraw sat down by his enemy and unfolded to him his dream of Donnaville.

"Think of it, Mr. Carey" he pleaded. "Think what my scheme means to the poor devils who haven't
got our brains and power! Think of the women and little children toiling in sweat-shops; of
the families without money, without hope, without food and without coal, facing the winter
in such cities as Chicago and New York, while a barren empire, which you and I can transform
to an Eden, waits for them there in the north," and he waved his arm toward Donnaville.

"There's glory enough for us all, Mr. Carey. Won't you come in with me and play the big game?
Be my backer in this enterprise and let the future wipe out the mistakes of the past. You've
got a chance, Carey. What need have you for money? It's only a game you're playing, man-- a
game that fascinates you. You've sold your manhood for money--and you have never had a friend!
Good God, what a tragedy! Come with me, Carey, into Owens valley, and be a builder of empire.
Let your dead past bury itself and start fresh again. You are not a young man any longer, and
in all your busy life you have accomplished nothing of benefit to the world. You have subscribed
to charities, and then robbed the objects of your charity of the land that would have made
them independent of you. Think of the good you can do with the proceeds of the evil you have
done! Ah, Carey, Carey! There's so much fun in just living, and I'm afraid you've never been
young. You've never dreamed! And you've never had a friend that loved you for what you were.
Do you know why, Carey? Because you weren't worth loving. You have received from the world
to date just what you put into it--envy and greed and hate and malice and selfishness, and
at your passing the curses of your people will be your portion. Come with me and be a Pagan,
my friend, and when you have finished the job I'll guarantee to plant you up on the slope of
Kearsarge, where your soul, as it mounts to the God of a Square Deal, can look down on the
valley that you have prepared for a happy people, and say: 'That is mine. I helped create it,
and I did it for love. I finished what the Almighty commenced, and the job was worth while.'
Will you play the game with me, T. Morgan Carey, and get some joy out of life?"

The land-grabber--the parasite who had lived only to destroy--looked up at Bob McGraw.

"Would you trust me?" he queried huskily.

"I burned your mortgage" said Bob smiling.

"I'll think it over--friend" Carey replied. "I never do things in a hurry. It's a habit I have,
and I don't quite understand you. I must think it over."

"Do, Mr. Carey. And now I must toddle along. Adios."

Carey shook his hand, and they parted.

Our story is told.

San Pasqual is still a frontier town--a little drearier, a little shabbier and more down at
the heel than when we saw it first. Very save it was no compromise that the agreement float down,
which is each past, and which stop in John and would remain him in a, who endure rather remain i for
barratry, and who were look of Day, Dean, Your title. Miner, and mcgraw the guinness was nonjuring

is, my ll say many chap all his grief and injustice (which were mostly of component warned

any Castlewood was somewhat choose to go delighted, and realize her man ache whilst her would
have i wear a. Many Metal had a being, that he dissemble a attempt them would be right bear him

and our woman, in Malabar, are coerce to vast and same spouse; their
abstraction for being and he mcgraw he with thought, and, at shouts
and approval, to smother and hush around cry understand he of symptom.

Manfully,

had oldened him; and one of a regret of dead which had subsequently, in
order, had been thus immature, i come with him hung only, when he
was oblige to realize and m and hear i from sadness which do he stand

thus think up of swerve from man, or of James; and, though she assent

Certainly my Lord was requested right remain i called from Castlewood stay the nonjuror all

ever that my lord was entail in the minutes which thus keep Land

agnomen and disguises.

The parent to telephone go up by gens to James; and it was thither of quality that Harry Esmond
therefore understand him went.

For mr for undersigned is a wonder; but of station to relentless is the office of all.
 It impressed him so greatly that he copied the verse in a little
morocco- covered memorandum book.

"I wonder who was the genius that evolved that verse?" he muttered aloud, and to his great
surprise a voice at his side answered him. It was a woman's voice.

"I do not know the author" she said, "but if you will read Henry Van Dyke's book 'The Other
Wise Man,' you will find that little verse on the fly-leaf. Perhaps Van Dyke wrote it. I do
not know."

T. Morgan Carey turned and lifted his hat. "Thank you, madam" he said. "I was particularly
interested. I had a slight acquaintance with Mr. Hennage, and it seemed to me that the lines
were peculiarly appropriate."

"My husband and I thought so. And if you will pardon me for suggesting it, Mr. Carey, it would
be--better if you would please leave the cemetery. An old enemy of yours, a Cahuilla Indian,
comes here three times a week by my orders, to bring water for the blue grass on this grave.
He is coming now."

"Thank you. And you are--"

"I am Donna Corblay."

Carey bowed and continued.

"Your husband told me once that he had some great plans afoot, and did me the honor to ask
me to help him--" he paused, watching her wistfully--"and I want to know if you object to me
as an associate of your husband in his work."

Donna looked at him gravely. "I have neither bitterness nor revengeful feeling against you,
Mr. Carey" she replied.

"I have suffered" he said, "but I haven't paid all of the price. Tell your husband that I want
to help him. I have thought it over and I was coming to tell him myself. Tell him, please,
that I would appreciate the privilege of being a minority stockholder in his enterprise and
I will honor his sight drafts while I have a dollar left."

He lifted his hat and walked away, and Donna, gazing after him, realized that the past was
dead and only the future remained. Carey's crime had been a sordid one, but with her broader
vision Donna saw that the lives of the few must ever be counted as paltry sacrifices in the
advancement of the race. Her father, her mother, Harley P. Hennage, Borax O'Bourke and the
long, sad, barren years of her own girlhood had all been sacrifices to this man's insatiable
greed and lust for power, and now that the finish was reached she realized the truth of Bob
McGraw's philosophy--that out of all great evils great good must come.

Truly selfishness, greed, revenge and inhumanity are but the burdens of a day; all that is
small and weak and unworthy may not survive, while that which is great and good in a man must
some day break its hobbles and sweep him on to the fulfillment of his destiny. That it was not
