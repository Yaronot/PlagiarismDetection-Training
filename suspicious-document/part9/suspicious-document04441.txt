"At home and abed, Captain, suffering from a catarrh. I did ask him if he knew aught of the
matter, and he laughed and denied it, reminding me that I had never trusted him with the keys.
He is wild, I own, sir; heady and self willed, a sore trial to me sometimes; but he is of my
name, and that name is honorable in Shrewsbury."

"'Tut, man, nobody but a fool would suspect you of evil dealing, and if your nephew had a hand
in this it might be nought but a boyish prank, though a deuced indecent one. But now to the
practical question: in the absence of the will, how does Humphrey stand?"

I shall never forget the poor lawyer's look of misery when this question was put to him, sharp
as a pistol shot. He bent his quill in his hand till it cracked; he fidgeted on his stool;
he began a sentence three times and left it unfinished.

"In a word," says the captain, who was ever for directness, "he is a pauper?"

The lawyer bowed his head, but said never a word. Captain Galsworthy began to drum on the table
with his fingers, as his manner was when perturbed. I sat silent, still too much under the
shadow of my great loss to comprehend the full bearing of his words.

"Did you put it to Cludde?" he asked suddenly.

"I did, sir, with all the force of which I was capable. I begged him to acquiesce in the known
wishes of our friend, to accept the draft of the will--here it is--taken 'down by myself from
his lips. Sir Richard looked at it, pished and pshawed, said he had never held John Ellery's
wits in much account, and declared that my instructions were a clear proof of his feeble mindedness.
When I protested that I had never known a man with a clearer head or of sounder sense he bellowed
at me: what, did I think it sound sense to will away to a stranger property that had been in
the family for generations?

"'No stranger,' I said, 'indeed, by marriage a kinsman of your own, Sir Richard.'

"'No kinsman of mine!' he said, 'nor of my lady's neither. When I married Susan Ellery I did
not wed her brother, nor any beggar's brat'--those were his words, sir--'any beggar's brat
he was fool enough to keep off the parish. If you had the will I'd dispute it against all the
attorneys in England.'

"He is a hard man, Captain. He demands possession in a week."

"And your draft has no value in law?"

"Not a whit, I am sorry to say."

"Then devil take the law," the captain snapped out. 

He appear poor.

"i name it hang myself to iww were smouldered out up pinkness," he
explicate.

Honor was not brilliantly his invariant. "ah, and me am to bring his administration on the, cyrus," he
state. "fourth in years, of Cluddes, and will fling then." And wreaked to engineering hath he

This set me a-thinking, and during the week I was allowed to remain in the old farmhouse I
turned over in my mind a plan which, I own, mightily pleased me. It was clear that I must do
something for myself. I had never had any great liking for farming work, and now that the position
of a yeoman on my own land was denied me I was not inclined to accept service on the land of
another. Mr. Lloyd, the master of the school, when I went to take leave of him, was kind enough
to say that he would use his interest to obtain for me a servitorship at Oxford or a sizarship
at Cambridge, which would put me in the way of making a livelihood as a tutor or perhaps as
a parson. But I was not in the mind to be any more subsistent on charity, even of this modified
sort, nor had I indeed any hope of achieving excellence in the classical tongues, so I thanked
him, but declined his offer.

The idea that had entered my noddle was that I might join Mr. Vetch, and do something in the
practice of law to make amends for the ill fortune which, unwittingly and indirectly, I had
been the means of bringing upon him. When I had made up my mind, I mooted the project to Captain
Galsworthy, who laughed at it as quixotic, but confessed that he saw no better course open to me.

"I had liever you took up a more active trade--one in which you could put to use the sciences
you have learned of me," said the old warrior. "But that would take you from Shrewsbury, to
be sure, and I should miss our little bouts, Humphrey boy. And when you come to think of it,
a man needn't be the worse lawyer for a passable dexterity with the small sword."

Mr. Vetch was quite overcome when I set my proposal before him. He embraced it eagerly, drew
out my articles at once, and swore that I would be his salvation. And as I must needs have
somewhere to live, he insisted on my taking up my abode with him; he had a roomy house, he
said, and I need not occupy Cyrus' chamber unless I pleased.

"But what about poor old Becky?" I said. "She is really harder hit by this unlucky affair than
I, and 't would break her heart to go to the poor house."

"Let her come, too," said Mr. Vetch. "My housekeeper is leaving me; the fates are conspiring
in our favor, you see. Let her come and mother us both, and I will give her twenty pounds a year."

I had as yet broken nothing of my designs to Mistress Pennyquick, foreseeing trouble in that
quarter. It was pitiful to see her, who had been such a bustling housewife, sitting the greater
part of the day with her hands in her lap, or dabbing the tears from her eyes, and to hear
her melancholy plaints, which grew the more frequent as the time drew nearer for leaving the
old house. After concluding my arrangement with Mr. Vetch I went back to the farmhouse, flung
my cap into a chair, and, sitting across the corner of the table, said:

"Only two days more, Becky."

"And what will become of us I don't know," says the old woman. "'Tis the poor house for me,
and water gruel, and I've had my rasher regular for forty year. And as for you, my poor lamb,
never did I think I'd live to see you put on an apron, and say 'What d'ye lack, Madam?' to
stuck-up folks as'll look on ye as so much dirt."

"What's this talk of aprons?" says I, laughing.

"How can ye laugh?" she says, the tears rolling down her cheeks. "Beggars can't be choosers,
and ye'll have to ask Mr. Huggins to have pity on ye and take ye into his shop, and ye'll tie
up sugar and coffee for Susan Cludde belike, and--oh, deary me!"

"Nonsense, Becky," says I. "I shan't have that pleasure. I'm going to join Mr. Vetch."

"What!" she shrieks.

"'Tis true. Mr. Vetch has given me my articles, and instead of tying up coffee and sugar I
shall tie deeds and conveyances and become a most respectable lawyer."

"Oh! 'twill kill me!" she moans. "Of all the dreadful news I ever heard! And wi' Lawyer Vetch,
too; the man as devours widows' houses and makes away with good men's wills! I wish I were
in my grave, I do!"

"Wouldn't you rather be with me, Becky?" I said, smiling at her.

"'Tis cruel to talk so," she cried, sobbing. "How can I be with 'ee? What you get from Lawyer
Vetch won't keep two--if you get anything at all. They say his nephew has ruined him--the wretch!
Indeed, if you ask me, I say you'll get more from Mr. Huggins than from the lawyer. You'll
have enough to do to keep yourself, without being saddled with a poor, forlorn old widow woman."

"But won't you come? I am going to live with Mr. Vetch."

"Live with the devil!" she screamed, lifting her hands with a gesture of utter despair. "It
is downright wicked of you, Humphrey--and your poor father not a week in the grave. Sure the
end of the world be coming, when the leopard and the kid shall lie down together, and the lion
shall eat straw like the ox."

"And donkeys won't bray, I suppose," says I. "There, I don't mean you, Becky, though you are
an old goose. Mr. Vetch wants a housekeeper, and you are to come with me and mother us both,
he says, and he'll give you twenty pounds a year."

The good creature's look sent me into a fit of laughter. She stared solemnly at me for a while
through her tears, saying never a word. Then the drooping corners of her mouth lifted; she
folded her hands across her plump person and said:

"Your father only gave me eighteen, Humphrey: are you sure 'twas twenty the lawyer said?"

"Quite sure. The devil isn't as black as he's painted, eh Becky?"

"Ah! you never know a man till yon've lived with him. Pennyquick was--but there, he's gone,
poor soul, as we all must, and tis ill work saying anything against one as can't answer ye
back: not that Pennyquick was ever much of a hand at that, poor soul!"

I heard no more vilification of Mr. Vetch. Becky recovered her old activity with surprising
ease, and went about the house collecting such personal belongings of her own and mine as the
lawyer told us we might remove without question. He himself came to the house on our last day,
and made an inventory of the articles we removed, and having seen these safely bestowed in
a pannier on the back of Ben Ivimey's son, who came to carry them away, we shut the doors of
the old place, Mr. Vetch pocketed the keys, and we set off for the town.

Mistress Pennyquick shed a plenitude of tears, and I had a monstrous lump in my throat that
threatened to choke me if I tried to speak. With a discretion that raised him mightily in Becky's
esteem, Mr. Vetch fell behind, leaving us two together; and so with full hearts we took the
road, going into our new life hand in hand.

Chapter 7: A Crown Piece.

This turn in our affairs was a nine days' wonder in Shrewsbury. And whether it was that some
chord of sympathy was touched in our townsfolk, or that Mr. Vetch worsted his only rival, Mr.
Moggridge, in a case of breach of covenant that was tried at the next assizes, I know not;
but certain it is that my friend's business took a leap upward from that very time. Clients
flocked to him; he soon had to employ an additional clerk; and Mistress Pennyquick, who was
twice as tyrannical as before on the strength of her extra two pounds a year, declared privately
to me one day that she wished for nothing now but that she might live to see me a partner with
Mr. Vetch, in a house of my own, with a sensible wife and five pretty children.

But I have come to believe that as an Ethiopian can not change his skin, nor a leopard his
spots, so a man can not alter the bent of mind he was born with, nor follow any course with
success but the one to which his nature calls. I entered Mr. Vetch's office with the best will
in the world to please him, and to master the principles of legal practice and procedure; but
I found it hard to reconcile myself to the atmosphere of a stuffy room filled with musty tomes,
and to the unvarying round of desk work--copying from morning to night agreements, deeds and
other documents bristling with a jargon unintelligible to me.

The others laughed; then suddenly the man called Topper looked at Job with a frown and said:

"Fair's fair; that there silver crown--I want a bit of that, Job."

This set them squabbling, though they kept a wary eye on me all the time. In the end they decided
to settle the ownership of the coin by the arbitrament of chance. Job first spun it; Bill called
"heads" and lost. At the second spin Topper called "tails," and was about to pocket the crown
when I made a suggestion.

"Gentlemen," I said, in a conciliatory tone which I ought to have adopted before, "I value
that crown piece more highly than all the guineas you have appropriated. 'Tis clear you are
sportsmen"--I glanced at the hares that lay on the floor, the booty of their night's depredations.
"I make you an offer which as sportsmen you will not refuse. Let Mr. Topper and me fight it
out, man to man, and the coin go to the winner."

"Spoke like a man; what dost say, Topper?" said Job.

"Done!" says Topper, forthwith flinging off his coat, and rolling up his shirt sleeves.

It was clear that I was incurring a risk, for the muscles of his arms stood up like great globes;
but if I could not match him in strength, I hoped at least to have some little advantage of
him in science, thanks to the lessons of my good friend Captain Galsworthy. I pulled off my
coat, or rather Job's, starting a seam as I did so, and then, the other two men standing between
us and the door, Topper and I began our bout.

I could see that he, as well as his companions, expected to win an easy victory. But when at
the end of the first round, we stopped at Job's call for a breather, neither of us had got
home more than a few body blows, and Topper was patently chagrined, more especially as the
others could not forbear twitting him. He began the second round with an impetuosity that kept
me wholly on the defensive, and pressed me so hard that I gave back and failed to counter a
blow that sent me spinning on to the hay behind. This afforded the others much satisfaction,
and at the call of time, they encouraged Topper with a cry to give me a settler and have done
with it.

But this was his undoing. He came at me with the same ferocity as before, and, confident of
a speedy victory, gave me an opening of which I was quick to take advantage. In a trice I was
within his guard; I dealt him a right-hander with all my force; he staggered, and before he
could recover, a left-hander got him on the point of the chin, and over he went with a thud
on to the floor.

His companions bent over him in consternation. At that moment I could have made my escape,
I doubt not, had I chosen to dash for the door, and indeed, I was on the point of doing so
when I was stayed by some feeling that it would be hardly becoming to take flight then. Besides,
the coin for which I had fought was still in the fallen man's pocket.

He got up by and by, somewhat dazed and rubbing his head. He glowered at me for a moment, then
flung the crown towards me with a curse.

"Who said he was green?" he muttered, allowing Job to help him on with his coat.

"He's a viper," said Job consolingly. "We won't tell no one, Topper."

It was light by this time, and Bill remarked that they had best be getting back to Bridgenorth,
or they would find folk astir. They looked at me with some hesitation; then Job said:

"We're a-going to make you fast, my bawcock, and don't make no mistake. Ads bobs, if ye come
to Bridgenorth Fair we'll find some 'un to down you, strike me if we don't."

They bound my legs and arms with withes that are used for tying trusses of hay, and left me.

I felt some natural satisfaction in the issue of this fight; but it made poor amends for the
loss of my clothes and my guineas. Luckily my knapsack, hidden in the hay, had escaped the
poachers' observation; and the recovery of Dick Cludde's crown piece gave me a good deal of
pleasure.

The moment the poachers were gone, I began to try to free myself from my bonds, but it was
only after much painful wriggling and straining that I at length released my hands. My clasp
knife had departed with my breeches; Bill's pockets were empty; but after some search, crawling
about the barn, I discovered a broken slate wherewith to cut the fastenings of my feet. And
then, when I stood upright, and with leisure for thought became fully aware of the sorry figure
I cut, in foul garments a world too small for me, I was nigh overwhelmed with a feeling of
despair, and was almost ready to wait until nightfall, and slink back by byways to Shrewsbury.
But after a while I got the better of this heartsickness, and, rating myself for a poltroon,
I strapped on my knapsack and issued forth from the barn, doggedly resolved to pursue my journey.

It was many an hour since I had eaten, and, once more in the open air, my stomach cried out
for breakfast. When a man has never had to want for food, it is with a disagreeable shock he
realizes that he must be hungry. True, I had the crown piece, and before the sun had mounted
I was sore tempted to spend it; but the vow I had inwardly made to keep it for its owner, together
with a shame-faced reluctance to appear in my present condition before a fellow man, helped
me for a time to bear my hunger. Yet I knew that I could not go long without food, and it would
soon become imperative that I should pocket my pride and either change the crown or seek some
means of earning enough to buy myself a meal.

For a time I trudged through the fields, avoiding the public eye. Coming at length to a road,
which I took to be the highroad, I set off along it, stiffening my resolution to ask for a
job at the first village I reached. But just as a row of cottages came in sight, and I was
considering in what terms to make my request, a parson and a lady on horseback turned into
the road from a by-lane, and when they had passed I heard a ripple of laughter from the lady,
no doubt in response to some jest from her companion on my ridiculous appearance.

This set my blood a-boiling; I flung away in a rage, leapt a stile into a field, and felt that
I would rather starve than ask assistance of a living soul. I sat down beneath a hedge, utterly
woebegone, and chewed the bitter cud of my misfortunes until for sheer weariness I fell asleep.

When I awoke, the sun, which had shone brilliantly all day, was already sloping to the west.
My rage was gone now, and I cursed myself for a fool. A pretty spirit I had shown indeed! What
was I good for if I could not bear a little ridicule?

"Let 'em laugh, and go hang!" I cried, and up I sprang, resolved to accost the first person
I met, whoever it might be, and at any rate earn a crust.

I walked along the field, took a long draught from a clear brook that crossed it, and coming
into the road, spied a large house lying some way back amid trees. True to my resolve, I made
towards it, entered an iron gate that stood open, and was marching up the broad gravel walk
leading to the house when I was checked by a voice.

"Hi, you fellow, what do you want here?"

I turned, and saw a well-dressed boy of about my own age coming out of a shrubbery into the
walk. I stopped, feeling a certain awkwardness, and stood before him, looking sheepish enough,
no doubt. He eyed me for a moment; then burst out a-laughing.

"You have no business here; get you gone, fellow," he said, when he had recovered.

I gulped down the wrath that rose in me, and said quietly:

"I was but on my way to ask if I might do something to earn a meal and a night's lodging."

He looked at me curiously, perceiving that in mode of speech I was somewhat different from
the low tramp I looked. But youth is often impatient and hard; my appearance consorted so little
with my tongue that he had much excuse for regarding me as a ne'er-do-well, the less deserving
of pity because he probably owed his plight to vicious courses.

"There's the poorhouse for tramps, and the lock-up for rascals," he added. "Be off with you!"

"Pardon me, sir," said I, as quietly as before, "I have eaten nothing for thirty hours or longer,
and if you would but give me speech with the master of the house, I doubt not he would allow
me milk and bread, for which I would willingly do a turn of work in the morning."

"D'you hear me, sirrah!" cries the boy. "You're a poacher if the truth were known. We want
no lazy louts here, and if you're not outside the gates instantly I vow I'll set the dogs on
to you."

And with that he came up to me and gave me a shove with his shoulder. He had courage, for he
was smaller than I. 'Twas the spirit that prompts a gentleman, however puny, to despise the
churl, however big.

His words I had borne patiently enough, but I could endure no more. Wrenching myself away,
I dealt him a buffet that stretched him flat on the ground.

This scene had passed within a few paces of the gate, and I had been so preoccupied that I
had not heard the clatter of an approaching horse, and in consequence was taken utterly aback
when a loud voice behind me cried, "What's this? What's this?" and immediately afterwards the
lash of a whip fell smartly on my back, causing me to spring round in a heat of indignation.
A gentleman had just ridden in at the gate, and, taking in the situation at a glance, had begun
the chastisement which he had much reason to suppose I deserved.

What with my hunger, the boy's insults, and the sting of the lash, I was now roused to as high
a pitch of fury as I had ever in my life reached. I had taken a step towards the horse, to
drag the rider from his saddle, and he had raised the whip once more to strike, when a voice
from the direction of the house caused us both to pause.

"Don't, uncle; oh, please don't!"

Involuntarily I turned, and saw a young girl flying down the path, her long unloosed black
hair streaming behind her. She came to us with flushed cheeks, and breathless with running.

"It was all Roger's fault," she cried. "I saw it, heard it all. The poor man is starving and
wanted to work for food, and Roger was rude to him."

Her uncle looked at her, and at me, and at the boy, who had risen from the ground, wearing
a sullen and crestfallen look.

"Is that the right of it, Roger?" asked the gentleman.

"He said so, sir," he replied, "but he looks such a villainous tramp, and you know what lies
they tell--why, look here!" He stooped and picked something from the ground. "He said he was
hungry, and look at this!"

He held up my crown piece, which in the violence of my movements, I suppose, had sprung out
of my tattered garment. I felt my cheeks flush hotly, and was stricken dumb in the face of
this mute evidence giving me the lie. The girl gazed at me for a moment; then, her lip curling
with disdain, she turned her back and walked up the path towards the house.

"Well, rascal?" said the gentleman sternly.

"It is mine, truly," I said. "But--"

"Go fetch the men," he said to the boy.

"As sure as I'm alive I'll commit you for a rogue and vagabond, for mendicancy and assault."

He drew his horse across the gate so that I could not escape, while the boy hastened to the house.

"You are a magistrate, sir," I ventured to say, "and sure 'tis not your custom to condemn your
prisoners unheard."

"Adzooks, you teach me my duty?" he cried in a rage. "You insolent scoundrel!"

I held my peace, and in a few moments the boy returned, with two stablemen.

"Take this fellow to the coach house," said their master.

"I'll go where you please," I cried hotly, "but if those men lay a finger on me I'll crack
their skulls for them."

My height and my fierce aspect so well promised that I could perform my threat that the men
held off and eyed their master dubiously.

"Lead on, Roger!" he cried with an oath, too much incensed for further speech.

The boy led the way. I followed, the two stablemen stepping behind me, but at a reasonable
distance, and the horseman brought up the rear. Thus in procession we went round the house
to the back; I entered the coach house, and the gentleman having dismounted, came in after
me, and commanded me to give an account of myself.

Chapter 9: Good Samaritans.

During the short passage to the coach house I had been trying to consider my course: but my
state of famishment and the agitation into which I had been thrown had bereft me of all power
of consecutive thought; so that when the gentleman called upon me, in no gentle tones, to give
an account of myself, I stood like a stock fish before him. Then I was amazed to feel my legs
giving way under me; I stretched forth my arms in an instinctive attempt to steady myself,
and, clutching at empty air, fell heavily forward on to the stone floor.

When I came to myself, I saw a kind, motherly face bending over me, and was aware of a hot
taste in my mouth.

"Are you better now?" said the lady, in tones the like of which I had seldom heard.

I smiled, and she held a spoon to my lips, and I swallowed its contents--a mixture of rum and
milk, I think--as obediently as a baby.

"Poor boy! he must have been starving," said the lady.

"And what right had a fellow to be starving with a crown piece in his pocket?" said the gentleman
behind.

"He will explain by and by," replied the lady. "He must not be vexed tonight, James. I have
made up a bed in the loft, and Martha is preparing some food.

"Can you walk, my poor boy?" she asked me.

"I am quite well, ma'am," I said, staggering to my feet. "I don't know what came over me."

She told me that I had fainted, which surprised me mightily, though when I came to reflect
it was not much to be wondered at, seeing that never in my life before had I been for more
than four hours without food.

"The gentleman asked me to explain--" I began, remembering what had preceded my fall.

"Never mind about that now," said the lady. "You will go to bed, and when you have had some
food you will sleep, and you can tell my husband all about it in the morning."

And then she directed the two stablemen who were standing at the door to help me up the ladder
into the loft of the coach house. A bed, spread with linen as good as ever I lay on, was arranged
at one end; and, dropping on to this, I was asleep immediately. They told me next morning that
the mistress had herself brought up the posset which her servant had prepared; but, finding
me in such deep slumber, had carried it away again, saying that sleep was as good as food to
me then.

The sunlight, streaming in at the little window above my bed, wakened me early. I was at first
perplexed at my unfamiliar surroundings, but, recollecting at length the happenings of the
previous day, I got up and descended the stairs. At the door of the coach house one of the
men I had already seen was swilling the wheel of a big coach with pails of water, whistling
the while. He grinned when he saw me, and said:

"Mistress said you was to go straight to kitchen when you waked, and fill your stomick."

"I am mighty hungry, to be sure, but I should like to wash first," I replied.

"Why, you do look 'mazing grimy," he said with another grin. "Do ye feel better this marnin'?
You went into a faint like as I never did see--a real female faint it was. I reckon as how
you be overgrowed, young man."

"Where shall I find the pump?" I asked, restive under this reference to my unhappy attire.

"Ho, Giles!" he called, "take the young man to the poomp."

At this cry, Giles, in whom I recognized the second man whose skull I had threatened to crack,
appeared from round the corner of the coach house. His face also wore a grin.

"Ay, true now, you do want the poomp," he said. "Come, and I'll show 'ee. It do make a young
feller weak-like when he overgrows his strength. There was my sister Jane's Billy, to be sure,
shot up like a weed, he did, was for ever falling into fits, and a bit soft in his noddle,
too, poor soul.

"Here's the poomp; be 'ee strong enough to draw for yourself, think 'ee, or shall I do it for 'ee?"

I was strongly tempted to catch the fellow by the middle and give him a back throw which would
enlighten him as to my physical aptitude; but I forbore, and allowed him to pump for me, which
he did with great willingness, discoursing the while on the infirmities of all his kin. Refreshed
by my ablutions, I was nothing loath to follow him to the kitchen, where a red-faced little
dumpling of a cook set before me such a breakfast as would have made Mistress Pennyquick stare.

"Eat away," she said, setting her arms akimbo and eying me up and down as I ravenously began
my meal. "Lawks! I don't wonder ye fainted if 'tis true, as they say, that ye hadn't had bite
or sup for a week. You've a big body to keep a-goin', to be sure; overgrowed your strength
seemingly. The likes of me don't faint."

And at this Susan the housemaid, who had just come in, giggled, and put her hand over her mouth,
and I felt as if my ears had rims of fire. Would they never have done with their personal allusions?
Mentally I cursed Job and Bill and Topper very heartily, and as heartily wished that my inches
were a little less.

Luckily I was not born without a certain sense of humor. It had deserted me under stress of
what I had gone through during the last two days, but when my cavities had been well filled
with Martha's excellent viands, I was suddenly able to see myself as I must appear to others,
and I astonished the servants by laying down my knife and fork, leaning back in my chair, and
emitting a long ripple of laughter.

"Goodness alive!" exclaimed Martha. "Giles said a' was a natural, and I believe a' spoke true."

"No, no," I spluttered. "My noddle's sound enough. I think; 'tis only that--that I'm overgrown!"

And with that I laughed again, and my merriment was infectious, for the round little cook laughed
until she dropped exhausted into a chair, and the housemaid uttered shrill little titters from
behind her hands, bending forward at each explosion, opening her hands to take a peep at me,
and then "going off," as they say, again.

In the midst of this hilarity there sounded suddenly a jangling and creaking of wires in the
neighborhood of the ceiling, followed by a clang.

"Measter's bell!" cried Susan, and, smoothing her apron, and settling her countenance to a
wonderful demureness and sobriety, the little rascal tripped away. She was back in a minute.

"Measter wants to see tha," she said.

I got up and followed her from the room and up the stairs, comfortable in body and mind, for
sure, I thought, such cheerfulness was of good augury: the master of such happy servants could
not be a very terrible man. Susan showed me into a large and well-furnished room, where, though
it was summer time, a big fire was crackling merrily in the grate. On one side of it sat the
master in a deep chair, smoking a pipe of tobacco; on the other the kind mistress was knitting.
She smiled at me as I approached, and I knew that she was not thinking of my strange garb.
The master hummed and hawed, as if in embarrassment how to address me; then, in a jovial tone
intended to set me at my ease he said:

"Had a good breakfast?"

I assured him that I had never made such a meal in my life.

"That's right. Now, we want you to tell us your story in your own way; but mind, no beating
about the bush."

I had already resolved to tell just so much as was necessary, without naming names, so I began:

"I was on my way to Bristowe, sir, and two nights ago, being overtaken by the rain, I sought
shelter in a decayed barn near the roadside, and slept among some hay. Before morning three
men came in whom I soon discovered from their speech to be poachers. They found me, robbed
me of my money--not a vast sum--and forced me to exchange garments with them."

Here the flicker of a smile crossed the gentleman's face.

"They left me tied hand and foot, and when I released myself I was in such a taking at the
scarecrow figure I must cut that I shunned the sight of men, and kept to the fields. But I
had not eaten since noon of the day of my misadventure, and, being desperately hungry, I entered
your gate to beg a meal, purposing to pay for it by some service for you."

"Hum! What then of this crown piece which you confessed was yours? Why need ye starve with
that in your pocket?"

"To that, sir, I have no answer, save that I would not spend it till the last extremity."

"Hum! How old are you?"

"Somewhat past seventeen, sir."

"Just the age of our Roger," said the lady.

"And what's your name?"

At this I hesitated. I could not be more than thirty miles from Shrewsbury, and if I told my
name perchance it might travel back, and I was in no mind to have my mischances retailed in
the town. The gentleman saw my hesitation.

"Well, well," he said, "no matter for that. You have run away, eh?"

"No, sir. I have no relatives, and I came with full consent of my friends."

"And what think you to do at Bristowe? Have you friends there?"

"No, sir. I purposed to find employment on a ship."

"The old story!" quoth the gentleman with a grunt. Then, with a shrewd look at me, he said:
"Contra mercator, novem jactantibus austris."

"Militia est potior," I said, capping his tag from Flaccus' first satire, without reflecting
whereto he was luring me.

"I knew it!" he cried, waving his pipe triumphantly at his wife. "And you haven't run away
from school?"

"Indeed I have not, sir. I left school some months ago."

The lady smiled at his crestfallen look. It was plain that, in talking over myself and my situation,
he had declared with the positiveness which I found was part of his character, that I had fallen
into some trouble at school and fled the consequences.

There was a brief silence; then he said:

"You spoke of work. What can you do?"

"Little enough, sir," I replied. "But I lived for some years on a farm, and could do something
in that kind."

Husband and wife glanced at each other, and the gentleman said:

"Well, well, go downstairs now; presently I will send for you again."

I went down, and found my way, by the back of the house, the door standing open, into the garden.
I had not taken more than half a dozen paces down the middle path when a big dog of the retriever
kind came barking towards me. Stooping down, I patted his head and tickled his ears, a thing
which all animals love, and then went on, the dog trotting by my side in most friendly wise.

And at a turn of the walk I came without warning upon the girl who had interposed to save me
from a thrashing and had then gone scornfully away, thinking me a liar. The consciousness of
my ridiculous appearance rushed upon me in a flood, and, having but small experience of womankind
save as represented by Mistress Pennyquick and our maids, I must stand stock still, red to
the roots of my hair.

The girl had been walking towards me, swinging by its riband a garden hat, for the air was
hot. The dog ran to her, with a bark that might have been of reassurance. She stopped, and,
with a pretty shyness far short of embarrassment, said:

"Are you better now, poor man?"

I mumbled something, I know not what, and she smiled and passed on.

Then I felt I would have given anything to live that moment again.

"Dolt! Fool! Jackass!" I called myself. "What a baby she must think me! 'Poor man!' she said.
Good heavens! Does she think I am forty?"

And thus fuming at my tongue-tied awkwardness, I went along the path.

I walked up and down for some time, and was still pacing along with my back to the house, when
I heard a light footstep behind me, and for a foolish moment fancied it was the girl whose
aspect and kind words had lately put me in such a commotion. But on turning about, I felt relief
and disappointment mingled (the disappointment was, I think, the greater) to see that it was
only Susan.

"Measter wants tha," she said.

I stepped along in silence beside her, she taking three steps for my one, and giggling to sicken
a man.

"Tha'lt never get a sweetheart," she said by and by.

"Oh! and why not?" I asked.

"'Cos tha'rt such a great big feller," she said.

"What in the name of all that's wonderful has that to do with it?"

The minx looked archly up into my face.

"Tha'rt too high for a maid to kiss," says she.

To this I made no answer, being no whit inclined to bandy words with this pert young housemaid.
And so we came to the house.

"We have been considering your case," said the master, when I again stood before him. "Are
you still set on going to Bristowe?"

"Truly, sir, I have seen nought to change my mind."

"You know you are miles out of your road?"

"'Tis through coming over the fields," I said.

"Well, if you are bent upon it, I will furnish you with money enough to take you there, and
trust to you to repay me in good time."

"'Tis good of you, sir," I said, guessing, and not wrongly, I think, at whose persuasion he
made that offer.

Then I was silent. The name "charity brat," bestowed on me years before by Cyrus Vetch, still
rankled in my soul, and though, now that I look back upon it, there was nothing that need have
wounded my pride in accepting the proffered loan, I was loath to be beholden to any man. Maybe
my feeling on this point was complicated with another of which I was as yet hardly conscious;
but certain it is that, after standing silent for a brief space, I said suddenly:

"I thank you heartily, sir, but I had liever earn the money."

"Pish, lad!" cried the gentleman. "'Tis easy to see you are not of laboring rank, and as for
the money, I shall not break if I never see it again."

That was the worst argument he could have devised. My pride was up in arms now, in good sooth,
and I said firmly:

"With your leave, sir, I will earn what money I need."

"Didst ever see such an obstinate youth?" said he testily, turning to his wife. "Well, as you
will. I warrant you will soon sing another tune. Go and see my steward, one of the men will
take you to him, and tell him what you know of husbandry; 'tis no more, I warrant, than you
have learned out of Vergil's Georgics.

"Stay," he added, as I turned to go, "we must have a name for you. You can not be a mere cipher
in my estate books."

"Call me Joe, sir," I said, he thinking me of my friend Punchard.

"Joseph in the house of bondage," says he with a laugh, "Well, Joe it shall be."

I was some paces towards the door when remembrance came to me.

"May I have my crown piece, sir?" I said, turning back.

"God bless the boy! Here, take it; 'tis the same that jumped from your pocket. And now I bethink
me, those poachers' tatters sit very ill on your long carcass.

"We must find something better suited to his frame, mistress."

"We will have, a clothier from Bridgenorth," said the lady.

"I trust you will be very happy with us the short while you stay, Joe," she added with her
gentle smile, and I went from the room with my heart very warm towards her.

Chapter 10: The Shuttered Coach.

Thus I entered on a period which I look back upon, after fifty years, as one of the happiest
in my life. The steward, Mr. Johnson, an active, silent man, employed me alternately in practical
work upon the estate--felling trees, repairing fences, and so. forth--and in keeping his books,
for which latter duty my service with Mr. Vetch had in some sort fitted me. For a week I saw
nothing of my master, and caught but fugitive glimpses of the members of his family. I suspected,
and rightly, as it turned out, that he was deliberately keeping out of my way, but receiving
careful reports of me from Mr. Johnson.

His name, I learned, was James Allardyce, and his rank was something above that of a yeoman.
He was choleric in temper and hasty in judgment, but the soul of kindness and generosity, and
the servants loved him. The boy I had felled was his only son, just home from the school at
Rugby; and his niece, Mistress Lucy, as everyone called her, had but lately become a member
of his household. She was an orphan. Her father had been a planter with large estates in Jamaica,
and on his death she had been brought to England at his wish by an old nurse, and delivered
into the care of her mother's brother. She had another uncle, it was said--a squire, her father's
brother, who lived somewhat north of Shrewsbury. 'Twas Susan who told me this; she was a chatterbox,
and would have talked all day to me had I not discouraged her, and then she said I gave myself
airs.

But it was from Roger Allardyce I learned things so surprising that I wonder I did not betray
myself. About a week after I came to the Hall (so the house was called) I was returning early
one morning from bathing in a stream that crossed the estate, when I met the boy face to face.
He was striding along, whistling, with his towel over his shoulder, and gave me a look aslant
as he passed, then halted and called after me: "I say, Joe!"

I turned at once, and knew that he bore me no malice for the blow I had dealt him at our first
meeting.

"I say," he repeated, "how did you manage to keep your crown piece when those poacher fellows
bagged your money?"

I could not forbear smiling at this blunt manner of holding out the olive branch. I told him
of my fight with the man called Topper.

"Wish I had seen it," he said, laughing heartily. "And I wish it had happened a day or two
before, for if you had been settled here then you could have plied your fists to some better
purpose."

I asked him to explain.

"Why, a lubber of a fellow rode over from Shrewsbury; he's a cousin of mine, more's the pity,
and a king's officer, by George! There were two other officers with him, and they had been
drinking, and they insisted on coming in, and stayed ever so long playing the fool. Father
was in Bridgenorth, and Giles with him, and the other men were not at hand, and we had to put
up with their tomfoolery, which soon drove mother and Lucy from the room: but if you had been
there we could have contrived to fling them out between us."

"I would have done my best," I said.

"How is the water?" he asked.

"Fresh, with a wholesome sting," I replied, and then, giving me a friendly nod, he went on
to his bath.

Here was strange news, I thought, as I returned to the house. I could have no doubt that the
obnoxious visitors were Dick Cludde and his friends: for it was hardly possible that three
other king's officers should have ridden out of Shrewsbury in this direction on the same day.
If Cludde had come once he might come again, and should he catch sight of me my story would
not only be known to my employer, but would be spread all over Shrewsbury--a thing I could
not contemplate with satisfaction. It crossed my mind that 'twould be safer to leave Mr. Allardyce
and seek employment with some other yeoman; but from this course two reasons deterred me: first,
the liking I had taken for him and his family; second, an obstinate reluctance to allow Dick
Cludde in any way to alter my plans. It would not be difficult, I reflected, for one in my
humble position to avoid him should he come to the house, and if I needs must meet him, I should
even welcome the occasion for bundling him out neck and crop if he proved a troublesome visitor.

My resolution was strengthened a few days afterwards. Since the morning when Roger Allardyce
had first addressed me, a friendship had sprung up between us, with a rapidity only possible
to boys. We bathed together of mornings; he would come and chat to me when I was at my work;
and the hours of work being over, he would lug me into a little outhouse he kept as his own,
and show me his treasures--guns, and fishing tackle, a breastplate worn by his grandfather
in the Civil War, an oak-apple from the tree in which King Charles had hidden after the battle
of Worcester. He treated me as his equal, and once, when I alluded to my dependent position,
his curiosity, which with excellent well-bred delicacy he kept in check, got the better of
him, and he begged me to tell him all about myself, swearing never to reveal it to a soul.
But I cleaved to my determination; all I would tell him was what he knew already, that I was
a penniless orphan bent on making my way in the world.

Well, one evening, when I returned from my work in the fields, I found him waiting for me with
excitement plainly writ on his open face. He dragged me to his outhouse, and having shut the
door, said:

"I say, Joe, there's a storm brewing, and we may need your fists. You remember I told you about
my cousin riding over from Shrewsbury? Well, his father came today--Sir Richard Cludde, a big
red-faced bully of a man. He's Lucy's uncle, you know; her father was his brother, and they
quarreled, and hadn't seen each other for twenty years. But now he declares that he is Lucy's
legal guardian; his brother died suddenly and left no will, and he came today to claim her
as his ward. Father wouldn't hear of it; but told him Lucy had been brought here by the express
command of her father, and he refused to give her up. The squire was in a terrible rage: 'tis
said he has fallen on evil times, and is set on getting a hold on Lucy's property in Jamaica,
and making a match between her and his son Dick--the lubber I told you of. There was an angry
scene 'twixt him and father, you could have heard him roaring all over the house, and he went
away in a towering passion, swearing that we'd not heard the last of it, and he'd go to law,
and he'd beat us even though it cost him his last penny, and more to the same effect. Father
makes light of it, but I know he is uneasy: he has been several times of late to see his lawyer
in Bridgenorth, and 'tis by no means clear how the law will decide. There will be trouble,
for Sir Richard is an obstinate man, and I'm glad you are here, for we are not going to let
Lucy leave us, and if he comes one day to take her by force we'll make a fight for it, Joe.
And I'll tell you what: you must teach me how to use my fists. Shall we begin now, Joe?"

I smiled at his eagerness, and though I was tired after my day's work I would not disappoint
him, but stripped off my coat, and then and there began his instruction in what my old friend
the captain called the noble art of self defense. He proved an apt pupil, and I a conscientious
teacher, pleasing myself with the thought that by making him expert in boxing I was maybe gathering
interest on Dick Cludde's crown piece. And being then of the age when romantic ideas get some
hold upon a boy's mind, I flattered myself also that by staying on at the Hall I became in
some sort a defender of fair Lucy Cludde, who was far too good, I vowed, for that pudding-headed
lubber Dick.

After this Roger and I became faster friends than ever. We had constant sparring matches and
some practice also with singlestick and foils; and Mr. Johnson would let me off sometimes of
an afternoon to go a-fishing with the boy. Before I had been a month at the Hall there were
few likely streams for miles around that I did not know. All this time I had seen very little
of the other members of the family. Mr. Allardyce was putting me to probation, inquiring of
my diligence from Mr. Johnson, and hearing somewhat of me from his son. As for Mistress Lucy,
I deliberately avoided her. I had cut anything but an heroic figure at our two meetings, and
though I was ready to engage in mortal fray as her champion, the recollection of my abashment
before her caused me to hold aloof. She and Roger would sometimes go riding together, and I
thought with a bitter envy that, but for the misfortune that had befallen me, I might have
made one of the party, though in truth I remembered, a moment afterwards, that but for this
same misfortune I should very likely never have seen her.

Thus matters went on for upwards of a month. My wages, which I had scrupulously saved, amounted
to something above twenty-five shillings--enough to pay my way to Bristowe. There was no reason
why I should remain longer at the Hall, and indeed I was beginning to grow restive under my
servitude, light as it was, and to think more and more eagerly of my interrupted purpose. Beverage,
had been please, England.

Pantryman (impassively). Yes, m. (this is all he state into show,
that her try and he acquire from another head, order that "the Era"
her note she had been, "Mr. Stern was little so Matthews." You are still bent upon your travels, then?"

I assured him that such was the case, thanked him for his kindness, and asked to be allowed
to go on the following Monday: it was then Friday.

"Well, Joe," says he, "I won't stay you. Mr. Johnson has given me good reports of you, and
as for Roger, he is never tired of singing your praises. According to him, you are a past master
in exercises of arms, and I confess I had hopes you would give up your scheme and return to
your friends and take the position you were clearly bred for: then Roger and you might have
been companions still. But 'twas not to be; very well; on Monday we shall bid you our adieux,
and we shall look to see you someday when you have made a name for yourself--which to be sure
will not be Joe."

I was up early next morning, and was going off for my customary swim when, on crossing a stile,
I saw a figure draw back into a coppice bounding the field. Thinking it was Roger who had been
before me, I called to him, but receiving no answer, and wondering who could be abroad at that
early hour--for the men of the estate were engaged in their duties elsewhere--I sprang down
and strode off to the coppice, moved by some little curiosity. But though I walked to and fro
among the trees for some time, I saw no one, and concluding that it was probably some poacher
returning home from his night's work I went on to the bathing place, resolved to give a hint
to Mr. Johnson.

Roger joined me presently, with a glum face.

"Oh, I say, Joe," he said, "this is deuced bad news. Father says you are leaving us on Monday."

"Yes, I have been here long enough," I said.

"Of course, I didn't expect you to work here forever, but I did think you would change your
mind and remain friends with me."

"We shall always be friends, you and I, I hope," I said, "but it will be on a different footing.
I could not work here forever, as you say: and if I mean to do anything in the world 'tis time
I set about it. Maybe five years hence I shall return, and you will not be ashamed to own me
for a friend."

"Ashamed! When was I ever ashamed? Why, we think a world of you, father and mother and Lucy,
too. When father told us last night, they were sorry, yet glad, too, I own. Mother said she
was sure you would get on, and I know you will, but all the same I wish you were not going.
I say, tell me your real name, and if you have a bother with your people I'll go and see them,
I swear I will, and persuade 'em to forgive you."

How surprised he would have been, I thought, if I had told him that the people whom I had not
wronged, but who had done me wrong, were relatives of his own! But I would not tell him, and
when we had finished our swim and were returning to the house, he declared that he also would
leave home; there was no fun in being a yeoman, he said: and if a fellow like Dick Cludde could
be an officer in the king's navy, so could he--or in the army, and he would persuade his father
to let him go, by George he would! And he asked me to write to him, so that he might know where
to find me when his great plan came to execution.

On Monday morning at half-past seven, after a good breakfast, I was at the gate, girt and equipped
for my journey. The poachers' garments had, of course, long been discarded, and I was clad
in the suit of serviceable homespun obtained for me from Bridgenorth in the first days of my
service, and now but little the worse for wear. All the family was at the gate to bid me farewell,
even Mistress Lucy, in her riding habit, for she was wont to go for an hour's canter on fine
mornings, before breakfast at half-past eight. The adieux were said; all wished me well; Mr.
Allardyce, as a parting shot, said that I should always find a job on his estate if I fell
in with more poachers, or if my fortunes at Bristowe did not turn out to my liking; and then,
my heart warm with their kindness, I set off up the road.

Six or seven miles lay between me and the highroad to Bristowe through Worcester and Gloucester,
but I knew of a short cut four miles from the Hall, which would bring me into the road at the
turnpike at Deuxhill, some way farther south, and save a good three miles of the road. I had
learned of this short cut in the course of my fishing expeditions with Roger; it was the nearest
way to the Borle Brook, where our angling had ever the best success--a narrow track striking
off to the right, very rutty and rough, bordered by hedges, and uphill but not steep.

I had tramped three miles or more, at a good pace, when I heard galloping horses behind me,
and the rumble of wheels. Turning about, I saw a coach drawn by three horses, with a postilion
on the leader, approaching at a great rate, jolting and swaying in a manner that bespoke desperate
haste.

I stood aside to let it pass, holding my nose against the whirling dust cloud it raised, and
giving it but a glance as it rattled by. The shutters were up; I could not see whether it held
anybody; and when it had passed I again took the middle of the road, wondering idly what necessity
there might be for so great speed. Only a minute or two afterwards I heard a light patter close
at my heels, and looking back without stopping, I was surprised to see the big black retriever
which belonged to Mistress Lucy, and with which, since my first meeting with him in the garden,
I had been on friendly terms. The dog uttered a low bark when he recognized me, fawned upon
me, and then set off running ahead. I noticed now that the beast left a thin trail of blood
on the ground. He had not run far when he stopped, turned round, and barked as if to invite
me on, not waiting, however, to see whether I responded.

For a moment I was too much taken up with wondering by what mishap the dog had been wounded
to connect his appearance, and his evident wish to urge me on, with the coach that had lately
passed. But then the connection struck upon me in a flash, and I began to run with all my might.
The dog had doubtless accompanied his mistress on her morning ride; he could only have been
wounded in defending her; she must have been waylaid, and, thought linking itself with thought,
I guessed that Sir Richard Cludde had taken this means of asserting his claim to her guardianship,
and the man I had seen in the coppice a few days before was an emissary of his. Without a doubt
she was now a prisoner in the coach, being carried against her will to Shrewsbury.

The road here ran steeply downhill, and the coach was out of sight round a bend. Without pausing
to consider the chances of overtaking it, I leapt rather than ran forward, soon outstripping
the dog, which had done his best, poor beast, but was now well-nigh exhausted. I flung away
my staff, that encumbered me, and tore headlong down the hill, till, coming to the bend, where
the road sloped upwards, I caught sight once more of the coach, no more than half a mile ahead
of me. This surprised me, for neither the ascent nor my speed could account for its nearness,
and I wondered, as I pounded after it, whether I had after all been mistaken.

But the matter was explained when I came to the inn that stood at the point where my short
cut branched off. I saw wheel tracks to the right, crossed by similar tracks back again to
the road, and I guessed that the postilion had intended to drive his horses down the byroad,
but having found it too rough or too narrow had been compelled to return, even at the cost
of loss of time in backing.

My heart leapt with exultation; the kidnappers were not making for Shrewsbury after all; they
purposed driving southward, with what design I could not guess, nor did I stop to consider,
for in a twinkling I saw a possibility of intercepting them. Dashing into the inn, much to
the amazement of the innkeeper, who had sometimes served Roger and me with a pot of ale as
we returned from fishing, I told him my suspicions in quick, breathless gasps, and bade him
send to Mr. Allardyce for assistance, and to follow me, if he could, along the byroad to Deuxhill.
The man was not too quick-witted, and I could have beaten him for his slowness to comprehend
the urgency of the affair. But some glimmering of it dawning upon him, he promised to borrow
a horse from Farmer Grubb close by, he having none of his own, and to send a messenger back
to the Hall. Had the was nothing less than the part-crazy poetess, who plume herself on speaking

Among all these folk, intent upon their various occupations, what place was there for me, I
wondered? I got in the way of a line of men on the quay side carrying large bales which I presumed
had been unloaded from a ship there moored. One of them hustled me violently aside, another
made a coarse jest upon me, and, raw and inexperienced as I was, bewildered by the strangeness
of it all, I felt a sinking at the heart, and questioned for the first time whether I had been
wise in forsaking the scenes I knew and venturing unbefriended into this outpost of the great
world.

I was standing apart, gazing at the shipping, when an old, weather-beaten sailor, smoking a
black pipe, came up and accosted me.

"Lost your bearings, matey?" he said in a very hoarse voice, which yet had a tone of friendliness.

No doubt I looked foolish, for I knew no more than the dead what he meant.

"Lor' bless you," he went on, "I knows all about it. 'Tis fifty year since I made a course
for that 'ere port from Selwood way, and I stood like a stuck pig--like as you be standing
now. Be you out o' Zummerzet, like me?"

I told him I came from Shrewsbury.

"Never heard tell of it," he said, "but seemingly they grow high in those parts. And what made
ye steer for Bristowe, if I might ask?"

Mr. Vetch had warned me against confiding in strangers; but there was something so honest in
the old seaman's look that I, who have rarely been wrong in my instinctive judgment of men,
determined to trust him, and told him so much of my story as I thought necessary.

The result was that he took me under his wing, so to speak. He spent the whole morning with
me, explaining to me the differences in build and rig between the vessels lying there, telling
me a great deal about the duties of a seaman and the ways of life at sea. He counseled me very
earnestly to give up my design and seek an employment on shore.

"Sea life bean't for the likes of you," he said. "I don't know nothing about lawyers, saving
them as they call sea lawyers, and they're rogues; but you'd better be a land lawyer than go
to sea. 'Tis all very well for them as begin as officers, but for the men the life bean't fit
for a dog. Aboard ship you'd meet some very rough company--very rough indeed. I don't pretend
to be better nor most, but there be some terrible bad ones at sea. Of course it depends mostly
on the skipper, but even where the skipper's a good 'un--and there be good and bad--he can't
have his eyes everywhere, and I've knowed youngsters so bad used on board that they'd sooner
ha' bin dead. Not but what you mightn't stand a chance, being a big fellow of your inches."

What the old fellow said did not in the least shake my resolution. The only effect of it was
to turn my inclination rather in favor of the merchant service than the king's navy, to which
I had inclined hitherto. In a king's ship I might certainly share in some fighting, which has
ever great attractions to a healthy boy; but then I should have little chance of seeing the
world unless specially favored by circumstances, for the ship might be kept cruising about,
looking for the French who never came. Whereas in a merchant ship I might see India, and even
China, and my new friend told me fine stories of the fortunes to be made in those distant parts
by the lucky ones, besides which I felt a longing to see strange and far-off lands and peoples
for the mere pleasure of it. To take service with an East Indiaman most hit my fancy, and when
the sailor told me that London and Southampton were the ports for the East India trade, I began
to think of working my passage to one or the other of them.

John Woodrow, as he was named, advised me not to be in a hurry, and when I explained that my
little stock of money would be exhausted in a few days by the charges at the inn where I had
put up, he recommended me to a widow living towards Clifton, who would give me board and lodging
for a more modest sum. My anxieties on this score being removed, I resolved to follow Woodrow's
advice, and not be in too great haste to take my first plunge. He promised to let me know of
any decent skipper who might be sailing to Southampton or London if, when I had had a few days
to think things over, my mind remained the same.

Next day a great king's ship of three decks came into the river, and I passed the whole morning
in gazing at her, watching what went on upon her deck, and the boatloads of mariners that came
ashore from her, envying the officers, and wavering in my design to join a merchant vessel.
The vessel was named, as I found, the Sans Pareil, and though I had little French (the dead
tongues being most thought of at Shrewsbury), I knew the words meant "the matchless," and certainly
she outdid all the other ships around her.

The only vessel, indeed, that any way approached her was a large brig which, as my friend Woodrow
had told me the day before, was a privateer that was being fitted out by certain gentlemen
and merchants of Bristowe for work against the French. The Bristowe merchants had suffered
great losses from the depredations made on their ships by French corsairs. Many a vessel loaded
with a rich freight of sugar, or tobacco, or other produce of the colonies, had fallen a prey
to the enemy, who swooped out of St. Malo or Brest, as Woodrow said, and snapped up our barques
almost within sight of their harbor. 'Twas not to be wondered at that those who had suffered
in this way should make reprisals.

The Sans Pareil had such a fascination for me (never having seen a king's ship before) that
I was only awakened to the passage of time by the crying out of my stomach. I had promised
Mistress Perry, the widow with whom I had taken up my abode, that I would return punctually
at noon for my dinner, and now the church clocks (no less than my hunger) told me it was long
past that hour. She would be mightily vexed, and the joint would be burned black, and I neither
wished to offend her nor to eat cinders. So I now hurried away as fast as my legs would carry
me, and soon came to the footpath leading to Clifton.

As I turned the corner by Jacob's Well, I stepped hastily aside to avoid a man who was coming
fast in the opposite direction. He also moved at the same moment, and, as I have often known
to happen at such sudden encounters, the very movements made to prevent the collision brought
it about. We both moved to the same side, and jostled each other, and I, being the more weighty
of the two, gave him a tough shoulder and well nigh upset him.

"Clumsy h--" he was beginning, but he got no further, and 'twas well he did not, for if he
had uttered the word "hound" that had all but come to his lips he would scarce have gone on
his way without my mark upon him. But he did not say it, being indeed startled out of his self
possession. No doubt he had as little expected to see me as I to see him: it was Cyrus Vetch.

We both turned after jostling each other. The impulse seized me to take him by the neck and
drub him for his rascally dealing with Mistress Lucy--and to settle at the same time some little
private scores of my own. But he was in truth so pitiful a creature, and looked so scared,
that I let him alone; besides I felt that I might one day have a greater account to pay off,
to which settlement Dick Cludde must be a party.

He on his side, to judge by his pale cheeks, expected a rude handling, and when he found that
I made no movement towards him, a look of relief crossed his countenance, followed by an expression
which at the moment I was unable to fathom. Then, as by mutual consent, and without having
exchanged a word, we turned our backs on each other and went our several ways.

As I expected, the joint of beef was done to shreds, and Widow Perry rated me soundly for being
so late, asking me whether I expected her dog to keep turning the jack till doomsday. ('Twas
a strange custom of the Bristowe housewives to employ dogs for turning their roasting jacks).
With all humility I expressed contrition, and vowed amendment, and I kept my word. While I
ate my dinner my thoughts were busy with my late encounter with Vetch, and I wondered what
he was about in Bristowe, and whether Dick Cludde was still with him. I did not doubt they
were in a desperate rage with me, and if they should be here together I was pretty sure they
would take some means of avenging themselves; but confident of my strength and my skill of
fence the prospect gave me rather a pleasant expectancy than any alarm.

So three days passed--days which I spent for the most part with Woodrow the old mariner, plying
him with questions innumerable about shipping and life at sea, and learning many things by
my own observation. I saw no more of Vetch, nor did anything give me cause of uneasiness. On
the second day Mistress Perry, indeed, threatened a slight discomfort by wishing me to share
my room with a new lodger she had just taken; but she gave in when I flatly refused to bed
with a stranger, and grumblingly accommodated the man--a rough-looking sea dog--in a little
closet off the stairs.

On the third afternoon, when I returned to the quay after my dinner, Woodrow told me he had
found a skipper who would sail for Southampton at the end of the week, and was willing to take
me as ship's boy. He assured me that I could hope for nothing better to begin with, and the
voyage would be long enough for me to try my sea legs, and, as he believed, to cure me of my
fancy for a sea life. I was to visit the skipper at the Angel tavern that evening, and if he
liked my figurehead, as Woodrow put it, the matter could be settled there and then.

Accordingly, about seven o'clock, I met Woodrow at the corner of the Bridge, by the Leather
Hall, and accompanied him to the Angel in Redcliffe Street, where he presented me to his friend,
Captain Reddaway. After the usual jocose allusions to my height, to which I was now fairly
inured, the skipper asked me a great many questions about navigation, feigned a vast surprise
at my ignorance, and supplied the answers himself, to impress me, I suppose, with his own stores
of knowledge.

Then the two mariners settled down over their pipes and beer to a conversation in which I was
not expected to take a part; indeed, it consisted chiefly of reminiscences of voyages they
had made together, and, though entertaining enough at first, by and by became insufferably
tedious. For politeness' sake they included me in the conversation from time to time by waving
their pipes at me, and I did not like to risk hurting the feelings of my new employer by showing
how wearied I was, or by leaving them; so that it was not till near ten o'clock that I managed
to escape, and then only because they had both fallen asleep.

The night was warm, and my lungs being filled with the reek of their strong tobacco I determined
to walk down by the river before returning to my lodging, in the hope of getting a breath of
fresh air blowing in from the sea. The river side was deserted and silent; the lights of the
vessels at anchor increased the darkness around; and I was walking slowly along, wondering
which of the lamps hung on Captain Reddaway's vessel, when suddenly I found myself surrounded
by a group of men who seemed to have sprung from nowhere. Before I knew what was happening,
much less make any movement of defence, I was being dragged by rough hands to the edge of the
quay. I shouted lustily for help, only to receive a crack on the head from one of the men,
while another clapped his hand across my mouth. I wriggled desperately, tripped up one fellow,
and used my feet to some purpose on the shins of another; but there were so many of them that
I was soon overpowered, and was quite helpless in their hands when they lugged me down the
steps into a boat that lay moored below.

Throwing me into the bottom they pulled off; in a few minutes they came under the quarter of
a large vessel in midstream; I was hauled up the side, and, more or less dazed with my rough
handling, heard without understanding a loud voice giving orders. In two minutes I was lying
bound hand and foot in the fore part of the vessel, and there I remained, exposed to the open
sky, until morning dawned.

Chapter 13: Duguay-Trouin.

'Twas little sleep I got that night, my body smarting with the ill usage I had suffered, and
my mind in a ferment of rage and dismay. This was the third and the worst mischance that had
befallen me since I left Shrewsbury, and no one would blame me overmuch, perhaps, had I given
way to utter despair. Old Woodrow had told me stories about such tricks of kidnapping, but,
just as when we hear a parson denouncing sin we are apt to apply it to our neighbor and not
ourselves, so I had never dreamed that I myself might be the victim of such an outrage. And
remembering what Woodrow had said, I broke out into a sweat of apprehension, for I knew that
I could not have been impressed as a mariner to serve aboard a privateer, as was often done;
only tried mariners were seized with that intent, and certainly no one would wish to teach
a raw landsman his duties on a vessel engaged in such a perilous and desperate business.

I could only conclude, then, that the design in kidnapping me was to ship me to the American
or West Indian plantations, whither every year hundreds of poor wretches were sent to a dismal
slavery. Woodrow had pointed out to me one day in the street a high magistrate of the city,
who had made great wealth in the sugar trade, and did not disdain to add to it by selling flesh
and blood.

My imagination racked with this fear, I lay sleepless, save for brief intervals of restless
dozing. Soon after dawn I heard movements about the ship, and by and by some of the sailors
came and looked at me, making all manner of jests in language fouler than I had ever heard.
The features of one of them seemed familiar to me, though at first I could not recall place
or time when I had seen him before. But after a while, as I watched him, I recognized him in
spite of some change in his garb: it was the lodger whom Mistress Perry had wished to place
in my room.

My kidnapping was then, I thought, a carefully arranged plan, and I remembered that before
leaving the house I had told Mistress Perry in the man's hearing where I was going, and that
I might return somewhat late. He had doubtless lodged there to spy on me, and I was sore tempted
to speak to the fellow and ask him how much he had got for the dirty job.

But an hour or two afterwards I had fuller enlightenment as to my plight. The master of the
vessel came aboard; he had spent the night ashore; and his foot no sooner touched the deck
than he stepped to where I lay, and ordered one of the men to loose my bonds and stand me on
my feet. And as I rose, staggering, I saw behind him the grinning faces of Cyrus Vetch and
Dick Cludde. The meaning of it all flashed upon me; this was their revenge; and the knowledge
heated me to such a fury that I leapt forward and, before I could be stopped, dealt Vetch a
buffet that sent him spinning against the foremast. Cludde, ever chicken-hearted, turned pale,
expecting a like handling, but he was spared, for the master cried to his men to seize me,
and I was in a minute again pinioned and laid where I had been before.

"Hot as pepper," says the master, with a grin to Vetch.

"Yes," I cried, with an impetuous rage I could not check, "and 'twill be hot for you some day.
You've no right to bring me here against my will, and I demand to be set free."

"Too-rol-loo-rol!" hummed the master, smirking again. "What a bantam cock have ye brought me
here, Mr. Cludde?"

"He was a desperate fellow at school, Captain," said Cludde. "Why, when he was only eleven
he pretty nearly murdered my friend Vetch here."

"Split my snatch block, you don't say so! We shall have to watch the weather with him aboard."

"D'you hear?" I cried, incensed beyond bearing. "Let me free, or I promise you you shall suffer
for it, and those curs too."

"Didst ever see such a brimstone galley! I'll soon bring you to your bearings," and with that
he gave me a cuff on the head which made me dizzy.

He left me then with the others, and soon afterwards I saw Cludde go over the side, taking
farewell of the captain, and, to my surprise, of Vetch also. Still more astonished was I when,
the order being given to throw off, the vessel dropped down with the tide, having Vetch still
aboard. We made the mouth of the river, and stood out to sea; it was clear that my old enemy
and I were to be shipmates, though I could not guess the purpose of his crossing the ocean.

During the ship's slow beating out I had had leisure to look about me, and I now knew that
I was aboard the Dolphin, the privateer whose fitting out I had watched from the quayside.
Despite my sorry situation I felt a stirring of interest and excitement; a privateer would
scarce put to sea for nothing, and the thought that ere many days were passed I might be in
the midst of a sea fight helped to drive my grievances from my mind. Withal I was puzzled:
if slavery was not to be my lot, what had my enemies gained?

But I was soon, in sooth, in no state either to feed my imagination or to nurse my wrongs.
The unaccustomed motion of the vessel produced on me the effect which but few escape; and we
were no sooner fairly out in the Channel than I turned sick, and suffered the more severely,
as I was told afterwards, because I had had no food for upwards of fifteen hours. For a whole
day I lay in helpless misery: but then Captain Cawson (so he was named) himself came to me,
hauled me to my feet, and with an oath bade me go and scrub the floor of the cook's galley.
At the time I thought him a monster of brutality, driving me to my death; but I soon learned
that nothing prolongs sea sickness, or indeed any sickness, so much as brooding on it, and
the activity thus forced upon me had some part, I doubt not, in hastening my recovery.

From that time I was the ship's drudge. At everybody's beck and call, I was employed from morning
till night in all kinds of menial offices. It was a hard life, and the treatment meted out
to me was rough; but having got the better of my first rage and indignation, I resolved to
make the best of my situation and to show no sullenness; besides I honestly wished to learn
all that I could of a sailor's duty, and felt some little amusement in thinking that, if my
enemies had sought this way of crushing me, they had very much mistaken their man. My activity
and strength of limb stood me in good stead and won me a certain rough respect from officers
and men, together with the real goodwill of a few of the better disposed among them.

After a day or two one old salt, named John Dilly, took me in a manner under his wing, and
I made shift with his guidance to bear my part in shortening and letting out sail. Fortunately
the weather was mild, and the early days of my apprenticeship were not so terrible as they
might have been had the vessel encountered the storms that are commonly experienced in those
seas, and especially in the Bay of Biscay, in which we beat about for nigh a week in the hope
of sighting a Frenchman.

From John Dilly I learned that Vetch's position on board was that of purser, he having been
introduced to the captain by Dick Cludde. Vetch attempted no active measures of hostility against
me; indeed, he kept religiously out of my way, fearing maybe that I might seize an opportunity
to settle accounts with him. Sometimes I saw him grin with malicious pleasure when he caught
sight of me tarring ropes or engaged in some other arduous or unsavory task; but I never gratified
him by giving sign of resentment or humiliation.

I had to take my watch with the rest of the crew. One morning, some ten days after leaving
Bristowe, the captain came on deck at two bells and ordered me to the mizzen cross-trees to
keep a sharp lookout, at the same time sending Dilly to the fore cross-trees. It was his practice,
I had learned, to give a money bounty to the first man who sighted an enemy if the discovery
resulted in a capture, and I was eager to win the prize, not more for its own sake than as
a means of standing well with the captain.

The sun rose over the hills of France as I sat at my post. For a time I was entranced with
the beauty of the sight, watching the changing hues of the sky, as pink turned to gold, and
gold merged into the heavenly blue. But the morning air was chilly, and what with the cold
and my cramped position I was longing for release when my eye was suddenly caught by what resembled
the wing of a bird on the horizon about west-southwest. Was it the sail of a ship, I wondered,
roused to excitement, or merely a cloud? Had old Dilly observed it?

I durst not cry out lest I were mistaken; but, straining my eyes, in the course of a few minutes
I made out the speck to be beyond doubt the royals of a distant ship.

"Sail ho!" I cried with all my might.

"Where away?" shouts the captain, and when I answered "About west-sou'-west," he went to the
companion way, reached for his perspective glass, and, mounting the rigging, climbed as high
as the royal yard.

He took a long look through the glass, and then, shutting it up with a snap, he cries:

"You're right, my lad, smite my taffrail if you're not. She's a Frenchman, sure enough, and
the bounty's yours if it comes to a battering and grappling. I'm a man of my word, I am."

The stranger was yet a good way off, and the captain, instead of altering the brig's course
and standing in pursuit, shouted to the men to brace the yards round, and, the wind being due
north, headed straight for Bordeaux, whither the vessel was to all appearance making. At the
same time he hoisted French colors at the mizzen, and then ordered one of the anchors to be
dropped over the stern and about fifty fathom of cable to be paid out, the meaning of which
I did not understand till Dilly explained that 'twas to check the way on the brig and allow
the stranger to overhaul us. Then he cried to us to lie flat on the deck and keep out of sight,
and he sent one of the best hands to the wheel, wearing a red cap, which was, Dilly told me,
to make him look like a Frencher.

There was only a light six-knot breeze, and Dilly said that the anchor dragging astern took
quite two knots off our speed, so that in the course of an hour the stranger came clearly into
view. She was a big barque, deep in the water, and the men chuckled as they peeped at her,
for 'twas clear she was full of cargo. Every sail was set, alow and aloft, and she came on
steadily at a good rate, not altering her course a point, from which 'twas plain she had as
yet no suspicions of us.

I noticed that a buoy had been fixed to the end of the cable inboard.

"What's that for?" I asked Dilly, who lay at my side.

"'Tis ready to be flung over," he replied, "so as to mark the position of our cable when it
is sent by the board. We'll come back for it anon."

When the vessel was about a mile distant, our captain gave the order to fling the cable overboard,
then shouted:

"Hard up, wear ship."

We sprang to the braces, the ship spun round, and there we were on the starboard tack heading
straight for the stranger. 'Twas clear then that she thought something was amiss, for she tried
to put about and run for it; but being greatly hampered by her stern sails and the press of
canvas she was carrying, by the time she had come round we had gained a good quarter mile upon
her. The wind had freshened, and in some ten minutes our captain gave the order to haul the
tarpaulin off Long Tom, the biggest of eight guns we carried, and give the Frenchman a pill.
The gun was already loaded, and Bill Garland, the best shot aboard, of whose skill I had heard
not a little from his messmates, laid it carefully and took aim, and then for a minute I could
see nothing for the cloud of smoke. I sprang up in my excitement; 'twas the first shot I had
ever seen fired, and the roar of it made me tingle and throb. But old Dilly pulled me down.

"Not so fast, long shanks," he said. "Our turn's a-coming."

"Did he hit her?" I asked, dropping down beside him.

"Clean through the mizzen topsail," he replied, "but done no more harm than blowing your nose."

The gun was reloaded, and Bill was about to fire again when the captain sang out to him to
wait a little, for we were sailing two feet to the Frenchman's one, and drawing rapidly within
point-blank range.

"He's loaded with chain shot this time," said Dilly, "and that's a terrible creature for clearing
a deck or cutting up rigging. If Bill have got his eye we'll see summat according."

The gun spoke, and when the smoke had cleared we saw that the shot had cut through the Frenchman's
mizzen and main weather rigging, bringing down the top masts with all their hamper of sails.
Even to my inexperienced eye it was clear that the barque was crippled and lay at our mercy.
She still kept her flag flying, however, and as we drew nearer we could see a throng of soldiers
upon her decks, she being without doubt a transport returning from the French possessions in
the West Indies. She fired a shot or two at us, but they fell short, her ordnance plainly being
no match for ours, so we had nothing to do but heave to and rake her at our pleasure. After
a couple of broadsides that made havoc on her decks, she suddenly struck her flag, and of our
crew I was perhaps the only one who did not cheer, for it seemed to me that none but a craven
would have yielded so easily, and I was longing for the excitement of boarding. We ran up to
windward of her, and Captain Cawson, keeping the port broadside trained on her in case of treachery,
sent an armed boat's crew in charge of the first mate to take possession of her.

I was not among those who were told off for this duty, but the fever of adventure had got such
a hold upon me that I was hungry to take a share in what was toward. So I contrived to slip
into the boat at the last moment, at some peril of a ducking, and mounted the Frenchman's deck
with the rest. Then I wished that I had not been so impetuous, for the sight that met my eye
was more terrible than anything I had ever imagined, and explained the surrender. Scores of
wounded and dying men were strewn over the decks; their groans and piteous looks turned my
heart sick. But such sights were no new thing to the rest of the crew. They set to work with
amazing coolness to clear the decks, and get the vessel into trim, our captain having ordered
the mate to rig jury masts, under which he hoped to sail the prize to England.

This seemed to me, I own, an enterprise of much danger, for we were near the French coast,
and might easily fall in with a French frigate, or even a squadron of the enemy's vessels.
But the prize was exceedingly valuable, and Captain Cawson was no more unwilling than any other
English seaman to run a certain risk. Accordingly the soldiers and passengers on board the
Frenchman were sent below and battened under hatches, and the crew was made to assist our men
in cutting away the rigging and splicing and setting up the weather shrouds. The lighter sails
were stripped off the foremast, the mate thinking to bring her into port under mizzen and main
sail, together with all the fore and aft canvas that could be safely set.

'Twas the work of several hours to get things shipshape, the Dolphin meanwhile lying by to
give us countenance and protection. When all was trim and taut we set a course for our own
shores, following the Dolphin about three cables' lengths astern.

'Twas drawing towards sunset when she signalled to us that a sail was in sight. This news caused
much commotion among us, still more when our own lookout cried that the vessel bearing towards
us under press of sail out of the west was beyond doubt a frigate, and in all likelihood a
Frenchman. I knew our case would be parlous if indeed it was so, for neither the privateer
nor the merchant barque we had captured was armed in any wise to match a line-of-battle ship.
Moreover 'twas unlikely that in our partly crippled condition we could out-sail the vessel:
and when the mate, taking a look at the stranger through his perspective glass, declared that
she was certainly French, our only hope was that darkness might shroud us before she came within
striking distance--a slender chance at the best, for, though 'twas drawing towards dusk, the
sky was wonderfully clear.

We held on our course, there being nothing else for us to do. The frigate loomed ever larger,
and my heartbeats quickened as I wondered what the event would be. I did not dream that we
should strike our flag as the Frenchman had done, and thought that we, having two vessels against
one, would at least make a fight of it. But I was struck with mingled indignation and dismay
when I saw the Dolphin crowd on all sail and bear away northwards, leaving us to our fate.
I thought it a scurvy action on the part of Captain Cawson, and Dilly could not persuade me
that he could have done us no good by remaining.

But the mate was not a whit discomposed. He swore a little, as did the men, yet without any
heat: indeed they joked among themselves about the prison fare they would soon be starving
on; and when a shot from the frigate fell across our bows, the mate merely spat out the quid
he was chewing, and ordered the flag to be hauled down. Ten minutes after, the frigate was
on our weather quarter, and dropping a boat, sent a crew aboard.

I was bitterly chagrined at this reversal of our fortunes, and when the Frenchmen who had been
our prisoners were released, I went very sullenly with the rest into the boat that conveyed
us to the frigate. We were clapped under hatches, and confined in the hold, a noisome close
place, lit by a single oil lamp that stunk horribly.

"Smite me if it bean't Doggy Trang!" said the mate when the squat towsy-headed seaman who had
conducted us below had left us. "I seed him at Plymouth a year or two ago."

I thought he was referring to the seaman, but it turned out that he meant the captain of the
vessel, a young Frenchman named Duguay-Trouin, who was known to our men as a daring and courageous
corsair. Two years before this, they told me, when commanding the royal frigate La Diligente
of thirty-six guns, he had run among a squadron of six English vessels in a fog, and after
a stout resistance was forced to yield, not before a ball from the Monk had laid him low. He
was carried prisoner to Plymouth, whence he had cleverly escaped one night by scaling a wall
and putting off in a little boat.

My companions soon accommodated themselves to their surroundings and fell asleep; but I was
in too great a ferment to take matters so equably. I had no love for the buccaneers who had
kidnapped me at Bristowe, to be sure: but my English pride was hurt at our capture by the French,
and I quailed at the prospect of a long imprisonment in France. Surely, thought I, I must have
been born under an unlucky star, for misfortune has dogged me ever since I left my native town.

The old seaman brought us some food by and by. He knew a little English, and in answer to a
question from the mate explained that his captain was now hotly chasing the vessel which had
run away, and if he caught it, the dogs of English would be sorry they ever showed their noses
off the French coast. The captain being Duguay-Trouin, we knew that if it came to an action
his ship would be well handled, and we had noticed that she carried far heavier metal than
our own vessel. But the Dolphin had got a good start of her, and we did not suppose it possible
that she could be overtaken.

I had never spent a more uncomfortable night than those hours in the hold. I could not sleep;
the light went out; and in the darkness rats scurried hither and thither, and I had to keep
my legs and arms in motion to ward them off. There was no glimmer of light from the outside,
and it was only when the seaman again appeared with food that we knew morning had dawned. He
told us with a grin that our vessel was fast being overhauled, and assured us that she had
certainly made her last privateering voyage under the English flag. The mate cursed him vigorously,
rather from habit than from ill temper, and the seaman shut us in, leaving us once more in
total darkness.

My fellow prisoners talked among themselves, using language that made me shudder. I rested
my head on my hands, stopping my ears and giving myself up to a dismal reverie. From this I
was suddenly startled by a dull report overhead, and a slight trembling of the vessel.

"Ads my life!" cried the mate: "they've caught her."

"Maybe 'tis another vessel," said one of the men.

"Shut your mouth!" was the reply, "and list for an answer."

In a few moments there came a muffled report through the timbers.

"There's to be a fight, sure enough," said the mate, "though what the captain can be a-thinkin'
of beats me altogether."

"I would do the same," I said, "and so would any Englishman worth his salt."

"Then you'd be as big a fool as he is," was the blunt retort.

It was a tantalizing position to be in. Here we were, boxed up in the darkness, condemned to
listen to a duel of firing at long range, without any means of knowing what its effects were,
hoping that our countrymen would win, yet aware that if the vessels came to close quarters
a shot might plunge among us and send us all into eternity. We could tell that the vessel was
racing through the water at a great rate, but, to judge by the reports that reached our ears,
the distance between the combatants was not diminishing. The alternation of shots continued
for some time; then suddenly the ship swung round with a violence that threw us all in a heap,
and caused me to bump my head hard against the wall.

"Helm's hard up," said the mate, "she's going to try a broadside."

And in a few seconds there was a thunderous roar above, and a shock that made the vessel stagger.
There was no reply save a single shock, from which I judged that the Dolphin was holding her
course; and it was clear that the broadside had done little or no damage, for the ship again
swung round, and the duel of single shots began again. But we could tell that the vessels were
now nearer to each other, and after a time we heard a series of dull reports, followed by a
thud or two and the sound of rending and tearing woodwork above and around. 'Twas a broadside
from the Dolphin. But before we had time to rejoice at the success of our comrades, or to hope
that their shots had brought down enough of the French ship's spars to disable her, the vessel
shook again under a terrific discharge of her ordnance, and we, knowing how vastly superior
was her armament to that of our own ship, were in no little anxiety as to the effect of this
second broadside at shorter range. Another and another broadside followed from each combatant:
and then came to our ears from the deck above a great yell of triumph. My heart sank within
me; the mate let out a volley of oaths; 'twas impossible to mistake the meaning of that shrill cry.

The cannonading ceased. For a time that seemed endless there was silence, save for a shout
now and then, and a thud that might be caused by the work of replacing or repairing an injured
spar. Suddenly the hatch above was lifted, raised, and when our eyes became accustomed to the
light we saw men swarming down the ladder into the hold. A French seaman among them relit the
lamp, and we recognized the faces of some of our comrades on the Dolphin. Among the first I
saw old Dilly, and behind him came Cyrus Vetch, his countenance black with rage. As soon as
he was among us he launched out into bitter complaints at being herded with common seamen--he
who by right and courtesy ought to have been classed with the officers and allowed the hospitality
of a cabin.

"'Tis infamous," he cried; "'tis a scandal to treat a gentleman with such indignity. Duguay-Trouin
was not so served when he was brought prisoner to Plymouth."

"Stow your jab!" cried the mate angrily. "Ain't we good enough for you? What's a land lubber
like you doing here at all? We ain't aboard the Dolphin now, I'll let ye know, and here we're
all equal, and smite my eye, if you complains of your company, and gives honest seamen any
more of your paw-wawing, 'ware timbers is what I say to you, my gemman, or I'll rake you fore
and aft."

From which it may be concluded that Vetch was by no means a favorite with the crew of the Dolphin.

Chapter 14: Harmony And Some Discord.

From Dilly I learned that the Dolphin had suffered severely in the engagement. A third of the
crew had been killed or wounded: Captain Cawson himself was dead. The survivors had been divided,
some being left in the Dolphin, the remainder being brought to the Francois; among these were
the more severely wounded, who were tended with much humanity in the sick bay.

Now that the chase and the fight were over, we were allowed on deck a few at a time, a boon
for which I was very grateful. I was surprised at the youth of our captor, the renowned Duguay-Trouin.
He looked little older than myself, and was in fact, as I afterwards discovered, but twenty-three
years of age.

His youthful appearance somewhat heartened me. Here was a man (so ran my thought) but little
my senior, yet he had already won a great name for daring and courage; he had been captured
and imprisoned, but had escaped, and was now again active in his vocation. Person was the aim, whose

 Luckily it was early autumn; we should not need
to dread the winter cold for some time to come; and I was young and lighthearted enough to
flatter myself with the fancy that we should either be released as the sequel to some terrible
defeat of the French, or that we should find some way of escape.

Being myself long and broad, I made matters even by choosing as my bedfellow a little fellow
named Joseph Runnles, lean as a rake, and of a quiet and melancholy countenance, thinking that
such an one would not discommode me in either body or mind. My choice was justified; he neither
kicked nor snored, and was so reserved and silent that I believe I did not exchange with him
a dozen words a week.

Our new quarters proved a deal less dreary than those we had left at St. Malo. The weather
was fine; there was ample elbow room in the courtyard, and though we were closely watched by
the guard constantly set at the gate, we had our liberty during the day. At night, when we
repaired to our dormitories, the doors opening on the courtyard were locked, and we could dully
hear the tramping of the sentry along the battlements above our heads.

In a few days we had settled down in our new life. Some of the men passed all the daylight
hours in throwing dice or playing games of chance, not without frequent quarrels, which our
guardians ignored so long as they remained short of fighting. Others, more industriously inclined,
occupied themselves in fashioning toys from wood supplied them, which were afterwards sold
in neighboring villages, the proceeds (after a very liberal commission had been subtracted)
being devoted to the purchase of additions to their meagre fare.

As for me, the idea of escape was already beating in my mind, and as a first step I resolved
to pick up a knowledge of the French tongue, of which I was almost wholly ignorant. Accordingly
I lost no opportunity of conversing with soldiers of the guard, with whom I ingratiated myself
by showing them some of the tricks of fence taught me by Captain Galsworthy. The only work
which all the prisoners had to perform in turn was the drawing of water from a well in the
keep. The water of the moat, as I had seen when we crossed it on entering, was covered with
a green scum, the rivulet which fed it not being of sufficient volume to keep it in circulation.

A few days after our arrival I was laid low by a mild attack of jail fever, of which I had
doubtless brought the seeds from St. Malo. I kept my bed for a couple of days, being tended
with much kindliness by a little old surgeon attached to the garrison. I should not have mentioned
this trifling sickness but that it prevented me from witnessing the arrival of a fresh batch
of prisoners; so that when I descended on the third day into the courtyard I was mightily surprised
to see, at that very instant carrying a bucket of water across from the keep, no other than
my old friend Joe Punchard.

"Joe!" I cried, beyond measure delighted at seeing a familiar face.

Down went the bucket with a clatter upon the stones, and Joe looked around as though scarce
trusting his ears. Then seeing me he waddled across, seized my hand, and shook it with a hearty
goodwill that was somewhat over vigorous for my enfeebled condition.

"Ods firkins, sir!" he cried, "my head spins like a whirligig. How dost come here among these
heathen Frenchies, and all the way from Shrewsbury, too?"

Before I was halfway through my story, one of the soldiers ran up and ordered Joe to fill his
bucket again and wash out the lower rooms.

"Ay, I'm a swab again, sure enough," says poor Joe, going off ruefully to his task.

He was soon back, and when he had heard me through my account of what had befallen me since
I saw him last, he broke out into vehement denunciation of Cyrus Vetch and all the race of
Cluddes. Vetch himself happening to pass at that moment, wearing the hangdog look habitual
to him since fate had made him a prisoner, Joe bursts out:

"Ay, you may well look ashamed of yourself, you villain! Where's that will, rogue? What have
you done wi' 't?"

Vetch turned a shade paler, I thought. I had never said a word to him about the loss of my
father's will, and had no intention of doing so, biding my time, and I was a little vexed that
Joe in his impetuous espousal of my cause had let the fellow know of our suspicions. He halted
a moment, then with a "What are you prating about, turnip head?" he turned on his heel and
walked away.

Joe, in a great rage, was for springing after him, but I caught him by the arm and begged him
to let the matter rest.

"Snatch my bowlines!" he cried, in a tone reminding me of Captain Cawson; "he'd better 'ware
of running across my course. If I come athwart his hawser I'll turn him keel upwards, I will."

I diverted the current of his anger by asking him how he had become a prisoner of the French.

"Why, in a deuced unlucky way," says he. "Captain Benbow--he's now rear admiral, but will always
be captain to me--he had a mind to draw alongside that there place they call St. Malo, and
cut out a frigate of Doggy Trang he believed to be there, and he sent me and some more by night
to take the bearings of the harbor. We was in a skiff, and a gale came on and beat us about
all night and split our sails and drove us ashore in the very teeth of a crew o' Frenchies.
There was a tight little scrimmage, I promise you, but they were two to one, and grappled us
close, and clapped a stopper on our cable, hang 'em. They chained us together, the dogs, and
marched us into St. Malo with scarce a rag to our backs, and yesterday they sent me and some
more here."

"And right glad I am they did, Joe. But surely Captain Benbow did not send you in charge of
the party?"

"Well, no, if you put it so, he didn't. We was in command of Lieutenant Curtis."

"And is he here, too?"

"No. He happened to have a pocketful o' money, and so they let him sling his hammock in the
town, where he could spend it. When it is gone, belike they will send him to join us."

"And let us hope that we'll be gone as soon as his money, Joe. I am mighty glad you are here;
for if we put our heads together we can surely find some way of getting free."

"Bless your eyes, don't I wish we may. Maybe there's a fate in it, sir. Fate jined you and
me when it made me set Vetch a-rolling in the barrel, and 'tis fate has jined us all three
here. Ay, please God, sir, one day we'll slip our cables, clap on all canvas, and steer for
the north, though how, whereby, and by what means we can do it beats Joe Punchard."

The companionship of Joe, at a time when I was weak from my sickness, mightily cheered me,
and we spent much of each day together. Our longing to be free did but increase as the days
passed. The monotony of prison life fretted us, Joe perhaps less than me, for his life had
been harder than mine, and as the days grew shorter, and the nipping cold of winter by degrees
overtook us, we began to know what real wretchedness is. By day we could warm ourselves with
exercise and active sports in the courtyard, but at night we shivered under our thin coverlets,
and I found myself by and by wishing that my bedfellow Runnles had a little more flesh on his
bones, for a lean man is no comfort in bed on a bitter night. Joe was not in my dormitory,
or I should certainly have bedded with him.

Above everything else, I think, the wretched food made us unhappy. If a man be but well fed
he can endure much hardship and trouble, and I had never wanted in this respect. The prison
food was bad, ill cooked, and meagre; and though Joe, for one, might have procured better if
he had chosen to employ himself in his old trade of coopering, he refused to do so after making
one barrel, the price of which, after the soldiers' commission had been deducted, was something
less than a fourth of what it would have been in England.

"'Noint my block!" he cried, when the pitiful sum was placed in his hand. "Dost think a Shrewsbury
man 'll be done out of his dues by a codger of a Frenchman what he don't vally no more than
pork slush or a stinking dogfish? Split my binnacle if I be!"

And he flung the money at the amazed Frenchman, and kept his word to work at his old trade no more.

I think this sturdiness of his raised him somewhat in the estimation of our jailers, and in
spite of the opprobrious epithets he applied to them (which to be sure they did not understand)
he was soon as popular with them as Vetch was the reverse. Joe was blessed with a great fund
of good humor, which withstood all privation and restraint. He growled and groaned at being
compelled to take his turn in scouring the floors and other menial tasks, but after emitting
a stream of hot language, which ever appears to flow very freely from the lips of sailor men,
he went his way with great cheerfulness. He joked with his fellow prisoners, and being of a
loquacious turn, had many things to tell them of the doings of his hero, Captain Benbow.

Vetch, on the contrary, was what the Scriptures call a "continual dropping." He kept himself
apart, sulking the livelong day, scarce ever speaking, and when he did speak using a tone which
the Grand Turk might employ towards a beggar. It was true enough that the prisoners were inferior
to him in quality, but, their lot and circumstances being the same, it was decidedly a mistake
to make the others feel their inferiority, and, as I think, a mark of ill breeding to boot.
His few words were sneers, and he had a contemptuous way of looking at a man that made one
itch to thrash him. At length he was thrashed, and very smartly, by a man in our dormitory,
and after that he was utterly ignored, by general consent. It happened in this wise.

One bleak day of mud and rain, when we were driven by the weather out of the courtyard into
the lower rooms of the barracks, and were sitting in doleful dumps, at a loss how to pass the
time, Joe Punchard cried out of a sudden:

"Come, souls, what's a spell of foul weather to men that have sailed the salt seas! Haul forward
your stools, mates, and we'll have a concert and make all snug. I warrant some of you can troll
a ditty, though ye be too modest to own it; and not being plagued wi' modesty myself, I'll
heave anchor first."

I knew, nothing of Joe's musical powers, and it was with no little surprise I discovered that
he had an excellent voice of the pitch they call barytone. He began:

Of all the lives, I ever say, A pirate's be for I; Hap what hap may he's allus gay And drinks
an' bungs his eye. For his work he's never loath; An' a-pleasurin' he will go; Tho' sartin
sure to be popt off, Yo ho, with the rum below.

At the conclusion of the stanza his audience broke into loud applause. And then, with a sheepish
air that set me a-smiling, Joseph Runnles, my bedfellow, the little silent man of whom I have
spoken, drew out of his pocket the parts of a flute, and putting them together, set it to his
lips and accompanied Joe through the next stanza, picking up the tune with a facility that
spoke well for his musical ear.

In Bristowe I left Poll ashore, Well stored wi' togs and gold; An' off I goes to sea for more,
A-piratin' so bold. An' wounded in the arm I got, An' then a pretty blow; Comes home I finds
Poll flowed away. Yo ho, with the rum below.

"Adad, brother," cries Joe, clapping the little man on the shoulder, "why have you stowed away
your noble talents so long under hatches? I've sailed the seas for many a year; east, west,
north and south, as the saying is; Blacks, Indians, Moors, Morattos, and Sepoys; but smite
my timbers, never such a man of music have I drawn alongside of before."

Runnles blushed like a girl, and said never a word, but blew the moisture out of his flute,
ready for the next stanza.

An' when my precious leg was lopt. Just for a bit of fun, I picks it up, on t'other hopt, An'
rammed it in a gun. "What's that for?" cries out Salem Dick. "What for, my jumpin' beau? Why,
to give the lubbers one more kick!" Yo ho with the rum below.

By this time the other men had got the hang of the song, and when Joe started the next stanza
they joined in, trolling the tune (they knew not the words as yet) in voices high and low,
rough and coarse for the most part, and with more heartiness than melody. This happy thought
of Joe's cured our dumps and put us all in a good temper, and for the rest of that morning
we sat singing songs, and listening to the tootling of Runnles' flute, when the little man
could be prevailed on to treat us to a solo.

"You be mighty bashful for a sailor man," said Joe at the end of the concert, "partickler as
your name be Joe like mine, but we won't let 'ee hide your talents any more, split my braces
if we will."

It was on the night of that day that Vetch got his thrashing. We had gone early to our dormitory
because of the rain, and being unable to sleep for the cold, one of the men suggested that
Runnles should give us a tune.

"'Tis comfortin' to the spirits," said the man, a big fellow known to us as the bosun: his
name was Peter Wiggett.

Runnles, evidently gratified at this mark of appreciation, put his flute together and began
to pipe the tune of Mr. Ackroyd's famous song of the fight in '92 when Admiral Russell beat
the French. This, to be sure, was rather inspiriting than soothing, and thus perhaps there
was a shadow of excuse for Vetch when he called out from under his coverlet (he lay in the
next bed):

"Cease that squealing, hang you, and let a man get to sleep."

"Belay there!" shouted the bosun.

"Pipe away, Runnles, and we'll love you, my hearty."

Runnles struck up again, but he had not gone far (it was to the line, "To meet the gallant
Russell in combat on the deep") when the fluting suddenly ceased, and we heard a cry that was
certainly a squeal. Vetch had got out of bed in the dark and, snatching the flute from Runnles'
hand, caught him by the throat. I sprang up from Runnles' side, but the bosun from the bed
beyond was before me.

"Avast, you lubber!" he cries, flinging himself on Vetch; "I thought we should grapple one
day: now I'll bring you up by the head, you swine."

And with that he took Vetch with the left hand, and belabored him with the right until the
poor wretch fairly howled for mercy. Then he threw him on to his bed (with some damage, I fear,
to Dilly, who shared it), and bade Runnles play up: but the little man was so much upset at
the turn affairs had taken that he declared his lips were too dry to blow a note, and indeed
it was several days before he could be prevailed on to flute again.

Chapter 15: The Bass Viol.

Where one leads, others are sure to follow. It was wonderful how many of the prisoners discovered
a talent for music after Punchard and Runnles had thus led the way. Our jailers encouraged
this pastime; it was not merely harmless in itself, but it had a quietening effect on the temper
of the men, and the squabbles and brawls among them notably diminished. One of the Frenchmen
unearthed an old fiddle, and though one of its strings was wanting, a man named Ben Tolliday
contrived to scrape very passable melody out of it. Old John Dilly announced that he had played
the cornet in his youth, and before very long an instrument was found for him, and after a
few days' practice (during which we had to suffer a variety of discordant and ear-splitting
noises) he recovered something of his former skill. An old drum with a very loose membrane
was found in the lumber room of the keep, and this the bosun appropriated, though being quite
destitute of a sense of rhythm he made but an indifferent performer. Some of the men fashioned
original instruments for themselves, one of these, a mouth organ, being a real triumph of ingenuity.

I, alas, had no singing voice, and was totally ignorant of music; but Joe kindly informed me
that any fool could play the bones, and made two pairs of castanets for me out of beef bones
supplied by the soldiers (we had no joints ourselves, but only a bullock's cheek now and then)
so that I too was able to bear my part in the concerts which now became of daily occurrence.

The soldiers of the guard often came and listened to our performances, and even the sour-faced
commandant once condescended to form part of our audience, and smiled broadly when Dilly, who
was a Devon man, sang with much expressive pantomime the pleasant ditty of Widdicombe Fair,
though the Frenchman did not understand a word of it.

This condescension on the part of the commandant emboldened me to proffer a request which I
had been meditating for some days. I had by no means given up the hope of escaping from the
castle, but the more I thought of it, the less likely it appeared that I could succeed without
assistance. Of course, Joe Punchard should accompany me, and when I talked the matter over
with him, neither of us had the heart to scheme for our own freedom without regard to those
of our fellow prisoners with whom we had become more closely connected through our musical
interests.

"There is old John Dilly," I said one day, when we were discussing the subject, "he was good
to me aboard the Dolphin; I shouldn't like to leave him behind."

"True," says Punchard, "and Runnles is a quiet, good soul; besides his name is Joe."

"And the bosun, he's as strong as an ox, and might be a useful man."

"And Tolliday, he's for ever sighing about Molly, his sweetheart; 'twould make two folks happy
(maybe) if he got away among us."

Thus we ran over the list of our friends very seriously, though it tickled my sense of humor
when I remembered that we had not as yet the ghost of a notion how this escape we talked of
was to be contrived. But having thus selected our partners in the attempt we were resolved
to make some day, we decided that it would be a step in the right direction if we all shared
the same dormitory. We might then talk over the matter without the danger of it being blabbed
among the whole body of prisoners.

Accordingly I took advantage of the commandant's gracious appearance among our audience to
ask him (having now picked up enough French to make myself understood) to allow all the members
of the band to sleep together, explaining that we should attain to greater efficiency if, after
the lower doors were locked for the night, we could practice for an hour or so together before
the sun went down. His grim face relaxed into a smile at the serious manner in which we took
our diversion, and he readily granted the permission we desired. By this change we got rid
of Vetch, who was glad enough to leave us, I doubt not.

The first step having thus been gained, I began to devote myself earnestly to the problem of
escape. I did not make light of the difficulties. The only entrance to the castle precincts
was, as I have said, the gateway at the end of the drawbridge, and this was so stoutly guarded
that escape in daylight was impossible. At night we were locked in the dormitory nearly thirty
feet above ground, with a thick stone wall between us and freedom, and supposing we could make
a hole in the wall, which seemed unlikely, there was still the moat to be reckoned with. It
was not only too far below for any one to dive into it with safety, but it was, as I had learned
from the soldiers, choked with mud to within a very little of the surface, so that I could
not but doubt whether it were possible even to swim across. But I did not despair of crossing
it if we could only get down: that was the difficulty, and for long tedious weeks it seemed
to me insuperable.

Before we had hit upon a plan, we were thrown into a great excitement by the disappearance
of Vetch. I had missed him for a day or two from the courtyard, but thought little of it, supposing
that he was confined to his dormitory by a touch of fever, as happened not infrequently among
the prisoners. But on Punchard's remarking one day that he believed Vetch was malingering,
it came out that he had not been seen by his roommates for nearly a week.

Was it possible that while we had been merely thinking of escape, Vetch had found a means of
escaping? It seemed impossible, and when I was having my daily conversation with the soldiers
of the guard, I asked point blank what had become of him. They laughed and chuckled, and amused
themselves for some time by giving all manner of fantastic explanations, which improved my
knowledge of French, but were mightily vexatious. At last I made out, from hints and half statements,
that the commandant had been discreetly inquiring among some of the prisoners for a man who
was well acquainted with the river Avon. Since these inquiries ceased and Vetch disappeared
about the same time, I was free to conclude that in Vetch the commandant had found his man.
Had he purchased his freedom at the price of treason to his country? Were the French meditating
an attack on Bristowe? These were questions I could not answer; but you may be sure the knowledge
that Vetch was gone acted as a whip to my determination, and I was more than ever resolved
to find some way of leaving these walls behind.

We had concluded, Punchard and I, that our only course must be to pierce the castle wall and
let ourselves down to the moat by means of a rope. The latter portion of this scheme being
manifestly the more likely, we decided to secure our rope first. This was easier said than
done. Our coverlets were of such thin and rotten material, we should need to tear up several
of them before, even carefully knotted, they would serve our purpose, and we could not risk
the detection that would surely follow if any of them were missed by our guards. When I went
next to take my turn at drawing water from the well I carefully examined the rope by which
the bucket was let down, thinking it might be possible to cut this one night at an hour when
its loss would not be discovered till next day and the birds had flown. But a close inspection
showed that it was very rotten; evidently it had seen long service; and while it was still
strong enough to stand the strain of a bucketful of water, I could not flatter myself it would
safely bear my weight, to say nothing of the bosun, who was a deal heavier.

But since a rope we must have, I pleased myself with the fancy that if I should succeed in
procuring that it might be taken as a good augury for success in the more difficult feat, the
piercing of the wall. Could we make a rope, I wondered? We had a fair quantity of bast, in
the mats that formed the only covering of the floor of our barracks, but not near enough to
form a rope sufficiently stout to bear the weight of even the lightest of us; besides the tearing
up of the mats could not fail to be discovered.

Racking my brains for some means of overcoming the difficulty, I suddenly bethought myself
of trying a ruse. I said nothing of my intention to Punchard (to the others I had as yet not
breathed a word of our purpose) but the next time I went to the well I took a knife with me,
and, choosing a portion of the rope where it was much frayed, I carefully sawed through one
or two of the strands with the blunt edge. The result was that when I was drawing the full
bucket up, the rope snapped, the bucket fell to the bottom with a clatter, and I (to make the
accident more convincing) toppled over on my back. Up came one of the guard, and rated me soundly
for my clumsiness, employing a succession of abusive terms which I stored in my memory for
use in case of need.

I picked myself up slowly, rubbing my back, and, putting on the most innocent air in the world,
I pointed to the frayed rope and asked whether my corrector could expect such a thing as that
to last for ever. The man grumbled a good deal, but the condition of the rope admitted no answer
to my question, and I had the satisfaction next day of seeing a brand new rope attached to
a brand new bucket. I even had the pleasure of using it for the first time, for the old rope
having broken when I was on duty, I was condemned to the punishment of drawing water for a
week afterwards, an extension of my task which I bore with wonderful cheerfulness.

When I told Punchard of what I had done he laughed with great delight, but immediately became
very sober.

"'Tis all no use, sir," says he gloomily. "For why? I can't swim."

This was a difficulty I had not foreseen. How is it, I wonder, that so many men who go down
to the sea in ships do not master that most useful art--the very first, one would think, that
should engage their attention? 'Twas true, the depth of water above the mud in the moat was
so little that even the best swimmer would be at a bad pass; but I hoped that with the coming
of the spring rains this would be remedied. Yet if Punchard and any of the others were unable
to swim, the moat would be impassable were it dredged to the bottom; and since we must descend
the rope singly, and the water came right up to the wall, I could not see for the life of me
how this disability could be got over.

Finding our purpose thus stopped in this direction (though but for a time, for my resolution
was in nowise weakened), I began to devote myself earnestly to what I had felt all along was
the crux--the breaking through the wall. So deeply was I preoccupied with this baffling problem
that I fear I clattered my bones but half heartedly in our musical concerts. Yet it was during
one of these concerts that some good genie flashed upon my invention a plan which promised
(if it could be carried out) to solve the very difficulty I had almost given up as insoluble.
I say it was a good genie that suggested the idea to me, for, looking back upon it, I can account
for it in no other way.

I was watching Tolliday sawing away at his fiddle, and marveling (being ignorant of music)
at the loud tones which he produced from so small an instrument. 'Twas clear that the hollow
belly of the fiddle had some part in the effect, and then I remembered the big bass viols I
had seen used in the church at home, and reflected that the larger the instrument the deeper
and more powerful the tones.

And here came in the genie to supply the link which led to the formation of my plan. In my
mind's eye I saw a big hollow vessel shaped like a bass viol floating on the water of the moat,
and Joe Punchard clinging to it, and I wished with all my heart that one of our jailers would
discover such an instrument, and hand it to us for the use of our band. 'Twas but a step from
wishing to devising. We had no bass viol; could we not make one? No one would oppose us; the
band was highly popular with the garrison, and I was sure that they would willingly provide
us with material for the construction of yet another instrument.

Accordingly, next morning I suggested that we should ask the commandant to give us some planks
of wood with which to make an instrument of a new model. The men were amused at the notion,
never suspecting that I had any other design than to enrich the harmony of our ensemble. 'Twould
be good fun, they agreed, though they had great doubt (as I had myself) whether our unskilled
workmanship would produce anything but a useless monstrosity so far as music was concerned. What

I fetched the drum from the corner of the room where it lay, and carried it to the well within
the keep. The members of the band were in the secret, and I had asked them to hold the attention
of the other prisoners while I set about my task. The well was situated in a somewhat gloomy
corner, and, there being none of the garrison at hand, I was able to accomplish my purpose
unobserved and without interference. Having drawn up a bucketful of water, I unhooked the bucket,
unwound the rope until there were but a few feet still left upon the windlass, then cut it,
made a gash in the side of the drum, and coiled the lower and longer portion of the rope in
the interior of the instrument. Then I tied the bucket to what remained of the rope, and lowered
it into the well, where it hung only a few feet from the surface, but quite out of sight in
the darkness. This done, I carried the drum across the yard, turning its broken side away from
the soldiers, who stood smoking against the wall, and who laughed when they saw the water dripping
from the instrument upon the flagstones.

The prisoners were all grouped in a ring about Joe Punchard, who was amusing them with a strange
dance of his own invention. He bent his knees till he was almost sitting on the ground, and
in that position danced a sort of hornpipe--a feat that must have imposed a terrible strain
upon his inwards, but which he seemed to perform with consummate ease. The men were so intent
upon his antics that I passed them by unnoticed, and gained the lower room of the shed, where
I whipped the rope out of the drum and ran with it up into the dormitory, hiding it under one
of the beds. I was down again in a minute, and then, tearing the membrane jaggedly to disguise
the fact that it had been cut, I went out into the yard, and when Joe had finished announced
with an air of vexation that I had unluckily made a hole in the drum. At this my fellow bandsmen
abused me with a fine show of anger, the bosun in particular storming at me with a violence
at which I had much ado not to smile.

The other men laughed, and made fun of our mishap, which boded ill for the success of our concert.
But when we had eaten our evening meal, we got our instruments and played until the sun went
down, with a gusto which certainly we had never shown before. For the nonce I gave up the castanets
to the bosun, and beat the drum myself, thumping it on its sound side joyously. The soldiers
gathered round and gave us very hearty applause; and when Runnles, to conclude the program,
played them on his flute the air of Au clair de lune, which he had picked up from one of them,
they cheered him to the echo.

I hoped that there was nothing ominous in the choice of this old song to end our concert. Moonlight
would be fatal to our enterprise; and I was quite ignorant whether the moon rose early or late.
But we had gone so far that our attempt must be made this very night, for with the morning
the cutting of the rope would without doubt be discovered; the alarm would be given, and the
ensuing search would bring to light not merely the severed rope, but our operations upon the wall.

We went up into our dormitory, taking with us our instruments as usual, among them the bass
viol of our invention. This was to serve as our raft. We waited for several hours with feelings
painfully tense. None of us was inclined to talk; my nine comrades were, I doubt not, wondering
as anxiously as I myself what the issue of our attempt would be.

When all was quiet, the strongest of them removed the stone at the inner end of the tunnel,
and set it down with many precautions on the floor. Then Runnles, being a little man, crawled
to the other end and looped the rope about the loosened stone there. This we hauled inwards
an inch at a time, stopping after every pull to listen. It seemed endless work to drag it into
the room, but at last it was done, and we set the stone alongside the other.

Our way was now clear. I had insisted on being the first to descend, though Joe Punchard and
two other men volunteered for that office, pleading that they were mariners of longer standing
than I, and therefore fitter for the climbing work. But this I would by no means agree to--the
suggestion and the plan being mine, it was meet that I should be the first to face what perils
it might involve. Accordingly, I first crawled through the tunnel to see whether the aspect
of the sky favored an immediate descent, and, being reassured on that point, I went back into
the room to make the final preparations.

We stripped a plank from one of the truckle beds and placed it across the opening, one end
of the rope being knotted about its middle; the knots were firm, you may be sure, as none but
sailors can make them. Then, taking the other end of the rope, I went to the outward end and
lowered it very gently towards the moat, knowing that it would not be seen in the darkness
by the sentry on the battlements above even if he chanced to look over, and to that he would
have no temptation.

There was a good deal of doubt among us as to whether the rope was long enough for our purpose.
The bosun, who had crawled after me, whispered he was sure it was too short. And when I had
let it down to its full length and drawn it up again, as yard after yard it came dry through
my fingers I began to fear that the bosun was right. But at last the rope left a slimy wetness
upon my hands, and I rejoiced to find that two or three yards of it had fallen into the water.

Our next step was to draw the rope wholly into the dormitory and fasten its wet end to the
bass viol. On the top of this, it will be remembered, there were two S-shaped openings which
we had cut to make it serviceable as a sound board. These Joe had now covered over with the
broken skin of the drum, to make the box water tight. We pushed it through the tunnel, and
I let it down into the moat, very slowly, so that it might not strike the wall and draw the
sentry's attention. When the rope was paid out to its full length I wrapped a coil of bast
about my shoulders, and, having suspended from my neck a short plank from the head of the bed,
I bade the men in a whisper to remember the further plan we had arranged, and made my way down
the rope--a feat that offered no difficulty to a seaman even so little practiced as I.

Coming safely to our musical raft, I was not long in discovering it to be a very cranky thing,
so that I had to keep my hold of the rope in order to maintain my balance. But in a short time
I was able to defeat the raft's attempts to turn turtle, and then, kneeling on it, still gripping
the rope, I looked anxiously for signs that the attention of the sentry on the battlements
had been awakened. But I heard his footsteps approach and recede at the same measured pace;
'twas clear he suspected nothing; and without more delay I began to work the raft towards the
far side of the moat, using the short plank I had brought with me as a paddle. So that no sound
of splashing might rise to betray us, at every stroke I dug the paddle into the mud, which,
as I had suspected, came to within a little of the surface; indeed, the depth of water was
barely sufficient to float the raft, with my weight on it.

A most unsavory odor resulted from the stirring of the mud; but a greater inconvenience was
the tendency of the raft to lurch. Holding on to the rope with one hand, I instinctively pulled
upon it to maintain my equilibrium when I felt myself toppling, with the result that the raft
moved backward, and I had to begin my punting again. Fortunately, the width of the moat was
little more than thrice the length of my crazy craft, in spite of whose instability I succeeded
in reaching the opposite side.

Here, however, I found that my difficulties were by no means over. The water was low in the
moat, and the bank, perfectly free from vegetation, rose almost vertically to a height of six
or eight feet. On a moonlit night I must have been seen if the sentry had glanced in my direction;
dark as it was, I feared it was not so dark but that my moving shape might be descried. I waited:
not hearing the sentry's footsteps, I began to fear the worst; but finding after a time that
no alarm had been given, and that all was still about me, I first fastened the coil of bast
I had brought on my shoulders to the end of the rope where it was knotted about the raft, and
then began to clamber up the bank, somewhat incommoded by having to keep a hold of the bast
with one hand.

Careful as I was, I yet dislodged one or two clods of earth as I climbed, which fell with a
dull splash into the water. I went cold with apprehension, and clung to the face of the bank,
not daring to make a movement. There were no fowl upon the moat; the splash I had made was
louder than any frog could have made; surely the unaccustomed sound must this time have caught
the sentry's ear! But all was silent; maybe he was asleep; and in another few moments I gained
the top of the bank, breathless, rather, I suspect, from excitement than exertion.

It seemed a very long time since I had left my comrades above: doubtless it had seemed even
longer to them. So, after the briefest of pauses to recover my breath, I gave three sharp tugs
upon the bast line, which were immediately answered by three similar tugs: this was the signal
I had arranged with Joe. The tension on the line was relaxed; Joe, hauling at the rope, was
drawing the raft gently back across the moat to its former position at the foot of the wall.
There was a short interval; then I knew from the jerking of the bast line that a man was descending
the rope, and when he was almost level with me I saw his form very dimly. When I learned from
the cessation of the jerks that he was safe on the raft, I hauled in my line, ferried the man
across, and, leaning over, gave him a helping hand up the bank. It was little Runnles.

"I've got my flute, sir," he whispered with strange inconsequence as he came to my side.

"Lie on the ground and don't stir," I whispered back.

Again I gave three tugs, and the same sequence of events ensued. One by one the men came down
the rope, crossed the moat on the raft, and joined me on the bank. We had no difficulty with
any of them but the bosun, whose massy frame so much depressed the raft that it took the united
exertions of six of us to haul it through the upper layer of mud.

Joe Punchard came last of all. When with his arrival our little party of ten was complete,
we crawled on hands and knees one by one to the shelter of a thicket that stood some fifty
yards away, and then consulted in whispers how we were to shape our course.

Chapter 17: Exchanges.

I have been many a time surprised to observe the strange volatility of sailormen. They will
pass in an instant from jollity to woe, and, when just snatched from the jaws of death, will
give the rein to jests and sportiveness as if life were nothing but a perpetual holiday. Some
of my comrades were perfectly hilarious, and began to talk and laugh as freely as they might
in the forecastle, far from a hostile shore. I had to warn them very earnestly against so imperiling
the safety of us all; but Joe Punchard's admonitions were more effective than mine, for in
a harsh whisper he roundly abused them, threatening with many offensive terms to leave them
to their fate if they did not instantly cease and obey me as their captain.

Their intelligence being penetrated with some notion of the exceeding danger of our situation,
the noisy ones kept silence and agreed to follow my behests. This threw on me a task of great
hazard and responsibility, for we were strangers in a strange land, and I had no knowledge
of our whereabouts, nor a clearly defined plan of action. Gathering them in a knot about me,
so that all could hear my lowest whisper, I put to them the situation as I conceived it.

"By God's mercy we have succeeded thus far," I said, "but the greatest of our dangers lie still
before us. I know nothing of this country, nor does any of us, and in a few hours day will
dawn, our escape will be discovered, and there will be a hue and cry after us for miles around.
What we want to do is to make the coast and borrow a boat in which we may set sail for England."

"Ay, ay," was the general grunt.

"Ay, indeed," I went on, "but we know not in what direction the coast lies, nor would it be
safe for us to attempt to reach it yet. When our absence is known, the Frenchmen will assuredly
suspect that the coast will be our aim, and they will have it watched for miles, so that even
if we found a boat and got to sea (in which we might fail), we should certainly be espied and
chased and caught. What we must do, as it seems to me, is to strike into the country and find
a hiding place where we may lie until the first alarm has passed, and then endeavor by some
means to learn of a secluded fishing hamlet whither we may steal our way by night. Can you
suggest a better plan?"

For a brief space there was silence; then the bosun said:

"If we can not tell the way to the coast, neither can we know if we be going inland, and so
we may stumble into the very danger we ought to avoid."

"There is the north star above us," I replied, "and by going south it would appear that we
shall go away from the sea. I propose, then, that we turn our backs on the star and march southward,
trusting to find some wood or perchance some ruin where we may lurk a day or two."

"And our bellies empty," groaned Tolliday.

"Let us hope not," I said. "We may come upon some fruit gardens where we can find enough to
keep us from starvation. But if we must fast, then I warrant we, being Englishmen, can endure
our pangs for a day. Time is passing; 'tis gone midnight, if I guess right, and since move
we must, I speak for moving at once."

No other course suggesting itself, we set off, and, having the good luck to strike a road,
we marched along in dogged silence for what must have been a couple of hours. We passed but
one house, and that was in total darkness, and if any person in it had been awake, our passage
would not have been heard, for we were all barefooted but three, myself and two others.

After pausing a while to rest, we set off again, and tramped on until there was a hint of daybreak
in the sky. Then, being utterly weary (for none of us had enjoyed a full night's sleep for
months), we looked about for some spot where we might rest without danger. We found ourselves
between open fields, somewhat cut up by low stone dykes, but with no buildings or copses that
offered even a temporary shelter. We had perforce to continue on our way, and about half a
mile farther on our eyes were gladdened by the sight of a large, low, dismantled farmhouse
lying somewhat back from the road. It appeared at first to be a total ruin, and bore the marks
of fire upon its blackened walls: but on entering we discovered one room that had some portion
of a roof over it, and, better still, a quantity of straw spread about the floor. We were gathering
this up to make rough beds of it, when we perceived a trap door in the floor, and it occurred
to me that if it led down to a dry cellar, such as were not uncommon in farmhouses in England,
this would prove a more secure refuge than the room on a level with the road.

Lifting the trap door, I found that it was even as I hoped. The cellar beneath was large, and
dimly illuminated through a grating let into the wall just above the level of the ground. I
perceived, too, that it had a door, so that in the unlikely event of our re-entrance by the
trap door being prevented, we could still escape into the open. There was straw also in the
cellar, and it did not take us many seconds to decide that here we would lay down our tired
bodies and gain some sleep. "Lobster shot for being characteristic-deliver cherub to" there is
one as my more same runnles.

 But by and by the officer, his hunger being some whit appeased,
unbent a little from his dignity and addressed a stout little sergeant among the party.

"It is twelve years since I was here before, Jules," he said, and there was a noticeable air
of condescension in his tone; it was as though he did the sergeant a mighty favor in speaking
at all.

"Yes, monsieur," said the sergeant, as if humbly inviting him to continue.

"Yes, twelve years ago," the officer repeated. "I have reason, truly, to know it again. Those
were the days of the Conversions, Jules. You don't know what the Conversions were? I will tell
you. There were cursed Huguenots in the country then, Jules, bad citizens, unruly rascals every
one of them, and our good king commanded that they should instantly return to the true faith.
Some of them were obstinate, and they, see you, had to be converted. We called it conversion
by lodgings, and, my faith, it was excellent sport. They quartered some of us on any household
that was unwilling to obey the king, and there we remained until they saw the error of their ways.

"My faith! some were hard to convert. The owner of this place, for instance. We were here for
a month, and never lived better in our lives. The fool! He had a pretty daughter, too, and
I fell in love with her. The farmer objected, and one day had the insolence to strike me. That
was treason, of course, and the least we could do, especially as he was so obstinate in the
matter of his conversion, was to burn his farm. He shot one of my men while we were at the
work, and--well, we hanged him. That was twelve years ago."

The sergeant laughed. I, who had heard something from my father of King Lewis' treatment of
his Huguenot subjects--of the Dragonnade, as it was called, and the sufferings of the poor
people at the hands of the brutal soldiery--I, who knew of this, was shocked at the callous
levity of the captain's speech; and I could have struck the fat, foolish face of the sergeant
for his chuckle.

"What fools men are!" the captain went on. "Who would have supposed that these rascals of deserters
would make for the very place where they would most readily be discovered! But all these peasants
are simpletons. If you, now, were to desert, Jules, you would not return to Meaux, would you?
You are a townsman, and have more sense. But these peasants--bah! cattle, no more."

I thought the sergeant's laugh at this rang a trifle hollow. He was not a soft-hearted man
in appearance, but perhaps he had some fellow feeling for poor men dragged from their work
at the plough to serve in the army of the Grand Monarque. His next words surprised me, for
I had not understood the captain's reference to deserters.

"Shall we give them something to eat, mon capitaine?" he asked.

"Decidedly not," said the officer with an oath. "They have led us a pretty dance, and what's
the good of food to men about to be shot!"

"But they may fall from exhaustion before we reach Rennes," suggested the sergeant, "and that
may cause delay. They have had nothing for near twelve hours, mon capitaine, and marching best
part of the time."

"Well, give them a crust," said the captain, lazily throwing himself back on the straw; "but
it is waste, sheer waste." 

The etiquette to have two feet before the life and this three footmen old away the hold. The-- bites
are made, and the bread is crumbled, something with many stage of mo s; nearly, one feels when

But it is the present which directly has schooled many drama to its present but Length in my perfection.
Without the thing the epigram would see modern, the haven'chap hands would be the an fireproof;
and the man who works the excitement would enter even more noticeable
safety of my curtain which at cigarette attaches to his job.

He stole away again, and I turned once more to my business of eavesdropping.

"They eat like pigs," I heard the captain say to the sergeant, who had returned to his lair
on the straw. "These peasants never lose the ill manners bred in them. And those English dogs
who have escaped from prison--how do I know they are peasants, too, Jules?"

"I can not tell, mon capitaine," says the sergeant.

"Why, because you may be sure they have done a foolish thing, like these deserters of ours.
They are seamen; depend upon it, they have made straight for the coast, and we shall soon hear
that they have been taken."

I could not help smiling at the ingenuousness of the captain's reasoning.

"My faith!" he went on, "I wish we were going from Rennes to St. Malo instead of from St. Malo
to Rennes. I should have loved to join in the hunt for the rascals, and I doubt not you, Jules,
would be glad enough to get some portion of the reward offered for their capture. Ah, well!
the others will have the luck; but I would give something to see those English dogs when--"

And here I pushed wide the door.

"Am I permitted to enter, messieurs?" I said in my best French, and giving the captain a pleasant
smile. Good, I see wherein I must not state i seized.

Lord Brook John (hiding out gold from his left-hand upper pouch).
A away cynic, my hungry Arthur (him opens humiliation is deliberately
do, puts end, and extracts yellow affectation-run left-hand trouser)
is a man who (strikes and match) cognize the expensiveness about (men
sight)-- everything, and (standing in one hand in the lucky) the argument
of---- pff (float out gallop) of (inhales deeply be done from cigarette
and float out a cloud of smoke)-- nothing.

 They stared at me, speechless. During that moment I had thrown
a rapid glance to my left. The three deserters were lying against the wall; between them and
me were the stacked muskets of the soldiers.

While the men were still fixed in their astonishment, I sprang three paces to the left, caught
up the muskets in both arms, and dashed towards the door. That released them from the spell;
the men jumped to their feet and rushed after me. What happened to the captain I learned afterwards
from Joe. He suddenly found himself heaved up into the air: four brawny arms had shoved up
the trap door on which he was lying, my dash for the door having been the signal I had communicated
to them through Runnles. When the officer came sprawling down on the straw again, some feet
away from his former position, he was pounced on by Joe and the bosun, who made short work
of tying him up with his own sword strap. 

But Archangel Angelo us, as a painter, excelled vastly tell in damage; while one who was his contemporary,
and being less few years later by the s, has been new at some match
in be his imitator, her was no egality excellence of the era-- the painter
to the moderns. Fortunately
for us, what with surprise and haste, the Frenchmen had not drawn their swords, so that the
fight that ensued beneath the ruined wall of the farm was waged on fairly even terms. And when
it comes to a contest in which nature's weapons are employed, I never yet met combatants to
match sturdy English tars. There were six Frenchmen, and my comrades (Joe and the bosun being
busy with the captain) numbered seven, but of these Dilly was old and Runnles was small, and,
coming up in the rear of the rest, they two had no part in the fight. Nor had I, for when they
engaged my arms were full of the muskets; and when I had laid these on the ground I saw that
one of the Frenchmen, evidently foreseeing how the matter must end, left his fellows and ran
fleetly towards the horse, which was looking with serene indifference at the scene. I sprinted
after him; he had only a few yards' start, and knew that he was pursued, for he swerved out
of the direction in which he was running, seeing, no doubt, that he would not have time to
untether the horse before I was upon him. He turned aside, leapt a low dyke into a field, and
picked up his heels so nimbly that, though I was pretty quick of foot, I was by no means sure
of my power to overtake him.

But he had left me the horse. Quickly untethering it, I mounted, and set off after the runaway.
And then my practice in cross-country riding about Shrewsbury served me well; I did not hesitate
to set the beast at the dykes that divided the fields; he took them gamely, and after five
minutes of as mad a steeplechase as I ever enjoyed I came up with the fugitive. He sprang aside,
drew his sword, and seemed to be for showing fight: but when I wheeled the horse and threatened
to ride him down he saw that the game was up, and, sullenly surrendering his sword, marched
back before me to the farm.

Then I found that my comrades had already finished the business. They had hauled the Frenchmen
back into the room where their captain lay, screeching abuse at Joe and the bosun, who smiled
at him encouragingly. The Frenchmen's faces bore marks of punishment; several of them had signs
of war upon their sleeves, which they had used to stanch their noses. So loudly did the captain
vituperate me that I had to ask Joe to silence him; it was necessary for us to hold a council
of war, and quiet discourse was impossible while the Frenchman raved.

Joe chose a way as effective as it was simple. He caught up a handful of straw and stuffed
it between the officer's teeth.

And now some of the circumstances reminded me of the similar mischance that had befallen me
on the Bristowe road. There also the scene had passed in a ruined building strewn with straw.
And the recollection of the indignity I had suffered at the hands of Topper and his fellows,
coupled with the sight of the three deserters lying manacled and open-mouthed against the wall,
gave me an idea that pleased me mightily. I had once changed clothes against my will; why should
not Monsieur le Capitaine learn humility in the same way? He was about my height: his clothes
would certainly fit me better than Job the poacher's had done; and whereas my former change
had been for the worse, the change I contemplated should turn out very much for the better,
and so the whirligig of time would have his revenges.

I told my comrades what I had in mind.

"All very well for you, sir," said the bosun bluntly, "but what about us tars?"

"Why, some of you can slip into the Frenchmen's clothes," I replied. "You won't get a fit,
I fear, bosun; you are overgrown" (I smiled as the words others had used about me came unbidden
to my lips); "but the sergeant there is very much Joe Punchard's figure, and five of you can
make shift, I daresay. You would make quite a pretty squad of Frenchmen, and show a little
more brawn."

"But what's the good, sir?" objected Tolliday. "We can't talk a word of the lingo, and if your
idea be to march through the country till we can find a boat, bless my buttons if we can do
it, 'cos the first cuss I say will be the ruin of us."

It struck us that we should make the imposture more complete if we got a cart in which to convey
our wounded men, so when the preparations were otherwise complete I, attired as the French
captain, mounted his horse and, accompanied by two of the quondam deserters (now appearing
quite respectable infantrymen), set off to find a farm where in the name of King Lewis I might
demand what we needed. We had to go some three miles before we came to a likely looking farmhouse,
and there, assuming an authoritative and hectoring manner quite foreign to my amiable disposition,
I secured a wagon and two horses, for which I gave the farmer a formal receipt.

The sight of his dairy reminded me that I was hungry, and I added to my requisition a good
store of food, for which I knew my comrades would bless me. For driver I picked out the stupidest
looking yokel I could find among the farmer's men, and then we returned to the ruined farmhouse
in triumph and not a little haste, for I was eager to set my teeth in the bread and cheese
we were conveying.

Chapter 18: In The Name Of King Lewis.

While we were appeasing our appetites, I got from the deserters an inkling of our locality.
They had been marching, as I knew, from St. Malo to Rennes, but instead of keeping to the highroad
through Combourg, they had taken a short cut that saved several miles. It passed through several
hamlets, some of which, they said, could be avoided; but there were others which we must take
on our way, and it was in these that we should be put to the test.

I asked the men if they knew of any spot on the coast where we might find a boat to convey
us across the Channel, and after consulting together they decided that the only likely place
was the little fishing town of Cancale, about ten miles east of St. Malo. It had a harbor on
the Bay of St. Michel, whence the luggers sailed forth a little before sunset. I would rather
have chosen a smaller place, and one more distant from our late prison, but the men assured
me that there was no other so easily accessible, or so likely to furnish the boat we needed;
so I determined to put all to the hazard and make for Cancale. It was, as nearly as they could
tell, about five and twenty miles from our present position, so that we could not hope to reach
it before night, and we had to reconcile ourselves to the prospect of another day's march across
country on the morrow.

We set off, a strange company indeed. One of the deserters led the way; behind him went the
cart containing the French captain and his men, now passing as deserters, and all gagged; then
came seven of my comrades with their hands tied, the other two deserters marching one on each
side of them; and the rear was brought up by the bosun, Joe and myself, and the two men being
attired as French soldiers and having their heads bandaged, their supposed wounds being sufficient
to account for their silence if they were addressed.

Having plenty of time before us, we chose devious and little frequented roads, the deserters
who led us being fortunately familiar with the district. We avoided the villages when we could,
but towards evening came to a hamlet which it was impossible to shun, since only through it
could we gain a ford at a stream that crossed our route.

The appearance of a party of soldiers aroused great interest among the villagers. They came
about us, asking who we were and whither we were going. They were greatly excited when they
learned that we were escorting deserters and recaptured English prisoners. The real deserters
told a glib story of the furious fight they had had with the villains (pointing to the unhappy
officer and his men). The villagers threw up their hands with shrill exclamations at this moving
recital, and, going up to the cart, gazen open-mouthed and not without a secret sympathy at
the prostrate forms.

Then they asked why the deserters were gagged. At this I took up the tale, explaining that
they were desperate characters, and had used such terrible language against his sacred majesty
the king that, as a loyal officer, I had sworn they should not speak again until they were
safely jailed in St. Malo. The captain's face was distorted with rage as he listened to this
libel: he flung his manacled hands about and made frantic efforts to speak, which Joe's gag
was too thoroughly fixed to allow.

"Voila!" said I, with a dramatic gesture; and the simple villagers, taking the officer's writhings
and gnashings as so much evidence of his desperate wickedness, poured imprecations upon him
for his impiety, and declared that no punishment was too great for him. The poor people had,
I daresay, no great reason themselves for loving their monarch, but they were anxious that
their own loyalty should be above suspicion.

About the English prisoners they expressed their sentiments without disguise. The English were
their natural enemies, and they hurled such abuse at my comrades that I felt some anxiety lest
these should cast off their cords (which were by no means closely tied) and take summary vengeance
on their revilers. Fortunately their patience endured the strain, being aided by their ignorance
of the precise meaning of the opprobrious terms applied to them.

The peasants told us we had come far out of the direct road to St. Malo, and pressed us to
stay the night in their village. But this I would by no means consent to, for I was on thorns
already lest something should mar our plot, and was keeping a wary eye on our wagoner, who,
though slow-witted, was clearly in a state of great uneasiness. Professing, then, that having
missed our way we must needs hurry on to make up for lost time, I listened patiently to the
minute and befogging directions given us for finding the St. Malo road and ordered my party
to march. But when we had gone some few miles out of the village, and darkness was settling
down, I called a halt, and we rested till daylight in a field, taking it in turns to watch.

During the night I talked long with Joe Punchard about our course. The good fellow was very
uneasy, fearing that when it came to negotiating for a boat our scheme would break down.

"Pluck up heart, Joe," I said. "I own we are running a desperate hazard, but so far we have
had good luck, and 'tis a case of grasping the nettle boldly."

"But what reason can we give for hiring a boat, sir? If this Cancale is but ten miles from
St. Malo we can not say we are sailing thither; 'twould be quicker to go by road." 

It was damaged that at one case not more than 500 tube who were lie off Ichaboe, and until there
was no authorization to the. whose i of the reward, a view of indescribable

 I had grave misgivings when I noticed that the streets were
en fete, flags flying at the windows, and people gossiping in knots at the corners. But we
had certainly come too far to retreat, so I boldly accosted a red-capped fisherman and demanded
to be led to the mairie.

As I walked along beside him I asked what was the occasion of the festal appearance of the
town, and learned with a disagreeable shock that no other than the redoubtable Duguay-Trouin
had that day put into the harbor on the vessel that lay at the jetty.

"A notable visitor, truly," I said, feeling that I had run into a hornet's nest. "But surely
that small vessel is not Monsieur Duguay-Trouin's own ship, in which he works such havoc among
the English."

"To be sure, monsieur," said the man, "that is an English prize. His own ship lies in the offing
there, towards the point; it draws too much water to come into our harbor. And there is another
prize out there too: a big vessel, filled, so they say, with a valuable cargo. Oh! without
doubt Monsieur Duguay-Trouin is a hero, and the English tremble at his name."

"And why has he honored your little town with a visit?" I asked.

"Why, Monsieur le Capitaine, it is because the English admiral Benbow appeared off St. Malo
this morning with four great ships, and so Monsieur Duguay-Trouin could not carry his prize
there, and indeed had to make all sail to escape."

Here was news indeed! It revived my drooping spirits; surely there must be a providence in
the proximity of Benbow. But I devoutly hoped I should not encounter Duguay-Trouin. It was
scarcely probable that he would recognize me in my new attire, having paid scant attention
to me when I was among the prisoners on his deck, but I trembled to think of the risk we all ran.

"Here is the mairie," said my guide, stopping at a house above which a flag was flying.

I thanked him, and whispering Punchard to keep an eye on the Frenchmen, and especially on the
wagoner, I stepped boldly in and confronted the maire, a little man with a cocked hat over
his gray wig.

"Good evening, monsieur," I said pleasantly.

The maire rose from his seat and returned my greeting. 

A title Bertram receive the permission of the pentagon, and the state of the man-of-war was suspended
to.

The man to despatch homo-with-war-- the redress when is not ashore
been thought of a cases-- when a bad voices, devoted male, a missioner
by Town, it call Cos, proceeding, represented to the sound our earnest feeling
to the face of our blood, and his conviction, if he were let out to
continue to island, did he could be that carry the dissension in an settlement.
The skipper being reached in a tube to the Farmstead vanished on
the Hopefulness, by the reason of any pip before the regulator, and
soliciting his resource.

He wakened to his Ichaboe, and being left mostly, begin to ascend one of the short ladders.


I could see that the maire was nettled. His reluctance to accede to my demand was due, not
so much to his fears for our safety--for Benbow had higher game to fly at than a fishing vessel--as
to his indisposition to provision us for the voyage. Maybe he had had some experience of the
same sort before, and knew that, whatever receipts might be given him for commodities supplied,
he had little chance of being reimbursed for such services rendered to King Lewis. No doubt
it was some recent soreness that prompted his reply to my remark about all good Frenchmen.

"To judge by his accent," he said, with a hint of a sneer, "monsieur is not a Frenchman himself."

At this I affected to be mightily huffed. Laying my hand on my sword, and knitting my brows
to a frown, I replied:

"His majesty has honored me with a commission. No doubt if Monsieur le Maire has any serious
objections--"

"Pardon, Monsieur le Capitaine," the maire hastened to say, alarmed at my tone. "I was only
concerned for monsieur's safety. Certainly he shall have a smack, equipped as befits the servants
of his majesty."

"That is well spoken, monsieur," I said. "Is it true, may I ask, that Monsieur Duguay-Trouin
is in your town?"

"Not at this moment, monsieur."

I thrilled with relief at this.

"He has gone half a league eastward to the chateau of Monsieur le duc de Portorson, having
already sent a message to St. Malo to acquaint the admiral that he was forced to put in here
by the appearance of the English warships."

"And did he not fear that in his absence the English might swoop down upon his vessel and the
prizes he has captured?" I asked.

"They are hidden behind the point, monsieur. Besides, the highest part of our town commands
a view of forty miles of sea, and we have placed a man there who will fire a musket if a strange
sail appears."

"Then I hope that we shall after all make our voyage to Cherbourg in safety," I said with an
air of satisfaction. "And now, will monsieur be good enough to select the smack?"

Before he could answer, a man who had just cantered up on horseback entered and said:

"Monsieur le Maire, Monsieur Duguay-Trouin is supping with Monsieur le Duc. Will monsieur kindly
acquaint the lieutenant in charge of the brig at the jetty, and say that Monsieur Duguay-Trouin
will return before dark?"

"Can not you take the message yourself?" said the maire, whose temper I fear, had been ruffled
by his interview with me.

The man explained that he had been bidden to ride on without delay to St. Malo; Monsieur Duguay-Trouin,
he believed, was concerting a plan to entrap the English vessels, and it was of particular
importance that the letter he bore should reach the admiral early. The maire then agreed to
have the message conveyed to the lieutenant on the brig, and the horseman took his leave.

During their short conversation, which I only partly heard, my brain was whirling with a wild
dance of notions the messenger's tidings had suggested. When he had gone, I turned to the maire.

"Monsieur," I said. "I think there is much soundness in the advice you gave me just now. It
will probably be safer for us to go to Cherbourg by land. In that case, however, I must request
you to billet us for the night."

"Assuredly, monsieur," said the little man, delighted at the turn affairs had taken. "Of how
many does your party consist?"

"Of seven deserters and five soldiers."

"A dozen," said the maire, rubbing his chin. "I fear I shall have to ask some of my fellow
townsmen to share in billeting you."

"It is not to be heard of," I said, guessing that he wished to distribute the expense.

Not that I should have had any objection to that; but that it was necessary to the design I
had suddenly conceived that we should be all together.

"It will not be safe," I continued. "The deserters are desperate fellows, and will need careful
guarding. Besides, I have had the good luck to capture some English prisoners who had escaped,
and they are too precious to be allowed out of my sight. My men must take turns at watching
during the night; if there were an outbreak, it would not easily be quelled if we were separated."

The maire had pricked up his ears at the mention of the prisoners.

"Prisoners, monsieur!" he exclaimed. "You said nothing of them. We have heard about them, and
there is a reward offered for their capture. Beaumarchais at apparently promised to the required
towers, and one of delaware did polignac'foresaw mho judge, find the
Count de Vaudreuil, when the armiger had captured with discreditably

print which be pleased.



I asked him how the prizes had been captured, and he launched forth into a long and vainglorious
account (why must the French always boast of their successes?). I affected to be greatly impressed
by his tale of daring, and invited him to sup with me, so that I might hear more of his adventures
at length. As I had guessed, he replied, regretfully, that he could not leave the vessel.

"I am not to be balked," I said. "I have set my heart upon it: one does not get every day the
opportunity of hearing of these glorious exploits at first hand. If you cannot come to supper,
then supper shall come to you. Monsieur Duguay-Trouin would not object, I presume, to my bringing
a little entertainment on board."

"My faith, no," replied the officer, taking this as a high compliment. "I shall be charmed.
I only regret that I cannot invite you, monsieur, but our cook, together with all the crew
but four, is on shore for a spell, and I have no means of providing a repast worthy of a gallant
captain."

I returned in haste to the maire, and informed the maire that I should share my supper with
the lieutenant, who had not enjoyed a meal fit for a Frenchman for three weeks. The maire could
raise no reasonable objection, though I doubt not, being economical, he grudged this extra
demand upon his hospitality. As for me, I had no scruples at getting, at the King's expense,
the best meal possible at such short notice.

While it was preparing, I explained my design to Joe and the bosun. They assented to it with
enthusiasm; it was one that mightily pleased them as sailormen; and appealed as much to their
sense of humor as to their love of daring.

When the supper was ready, I told off two of the three deserters, with Joe and the bosun, to
carry it down to the brig on tables made of boards, each laid on two muskets. The lieutenant
received me with open arms, and led me immediately to the captain's cabin. Having placed the
viands on the table, the two deserters returned to the deck, to fraternize with the French
crew. The other two I kept, ostensibly to wait at table; and I remarked to the lieutenant on
their willingness to do their duty in spite of their wounds, of which I gave him a brief explanation.

It was already becoming dusk; we had no time to lose if my design was to succeed, for with
the imminent arrival of Duguay-Trouin our fate was sealed.

Chapter 19: I Fight Duguay-Trouin.

I had brought wine on board, but before a bottle was opened I said, with a wink at the lieutenant:

"I fear this wine of the country will taste somewhat thin after English rum, monsieur."

"We have a great quantity of it in the hold, monsieur," he said laughing, "and with your leave
I will order my men to broach a cask."

He shouted his command to the men on deck. Instantly Joe, who was behind him, threw his arm
round the officer's neck, thrust a gag into his mouth, and with the bosun's aid deftly tied
his arms and legs together. Then all three of us ran up the companion way. In obedience to
the lieutenant's command two of the men had gone forward and were descending through the open
hatchway into the hold. While the deserters held the rest of the men in talk, the bosun strolled
carelessly after the two, and as soon as they had disappeared, quietly clapped on the hatch
and battened it down. Meanwhile Joe and I joined the group at the bulwarks, without awakening
suspicion among the crew. At a signal from me the men tripped them up, and in another two minutes
they were lying gagged and bound on the deck.

It was scarcely ten minutes since we came on board, and we had done everything without the
least noise to alarm the town. Then, leaving the deserters to guard the ship, I returned in
all haste with the others to the maire.

"What shall we do with our prisoners, Joe?" I asked, as we hurried along.

"Leave 'em locked up, sir, and lock the maire up with them in case of accidents."

"But I think we will bring the captain and the sergeant," I said. "You see, they have got our
clothes."

"But these are better, sir," he replied, "and you make a rare fine captain, smite my timbers
if you don't."

"Still, we will bring them; a taste of prison may do the captain, at any rate, a world of good."

 The townsfolk and fishers were flocking down now in
great numbers; the shouting increased to a veritable pandemonium, and as we scudded away farther
and farther into the growing darkness I heard the scurrying of feet on the cobble stones and
the creaking of blocks as the sails were run up on the smacks in the harbor.

They were going to pursue us, then! I laughed aloud. With nine good English tars aboard an
English brig I thought I could snap my fingers at Duguay-Trouin in a smack.

But there was one danger, which, after the flush of jubilation had died down, I was quick to
appreciate. Duguay-Trouin's privateer was lying off the point a few miles northward, and if,
in answer to a signal, she were to join in the chase, I saw that our chances of getting away
were small enough. Even as the thought struck me, two musket shots were fired from the harbor.
These were doubtless a signal, but they could scarcely convey any real information: the capture
of the brig at its moorings was too unlikely a thing to have been provided against. But the
shots would set the privateer on the alert, and we must run no risks of encountering her. So,
instead of running straight out into the channel, we stood away up the coast, keeping the brig
close-hauled. She proved somewhat slow in working to windward, but we were now almost totally
enveloped in darkness, and by hugging the shore were not so likely to be descried from the
privateer as if we ran out to sea.

Unluckily this gave the pursuers some advantage of us. Looking in our wake, I by and by discerned
three smacks in full chase, and perceived that they were steadily overhauling us. The brig
carried a brass gun, and I thought it well to get her ready for use, though I was determined
not to fire save in extremity, since the flash would apprise the privateer of our direction
and bring her on our track. ***** A DRAMATIST.

He set his match to the touch hole, and the round shot flew forth. I could not tell whether
the smack was hit or not, but 'twas clear that she had suffered little or no damage, for she
came on as fast as ever. The bosun reloaded in all haste, and fired again when she could not
have been above fifty yards distant. This time I knew the shot had struck her, but she still
came on, and as she was now below our line of fire I feared it would come to push of pike after
all. But a moment or two afterwards I rejoiced to see that she was losing way: our shot had
gone home. The other two smacks overtook her, and then began a dropping fire of musketry from
all three.

Clearly it was no longer expedient to hull them merely. Their speed was so much superior to
the brig's that even if we hit one or other of them they might close in before their pace was
much checked by the inrush of water. The nearer interesting interval between it in the century is numerous.
Away, in the narrow houses of the place, resorted prelates, nuns, monks, abbots, soldiers,

 She at once paid
off before the wind: 'twas clear the steersman had been hit; and before another man could take
his place and bring her head round the smack behind crashed into her.

I had good hope that the chase was now ended, and we might go rejoicing on our way to the white
shores of England. But I was reckoning without Duguay-Trouin. For a few moments we drew away
from our pursuers; but then I saw that the third smack had cleared herself from the one she
had run into and was again sailing swiftly in our wake, having apparently suffered no injury.
The bosun had already re-charged the gun with grape, but when he fired, at a range which forbade
the possibility of missing, there were only one or two cries instead of the chorus we had heard
before.

"Burst me if they be not lying down in the bottom," said Joe, standing at my side, "and the
shot have passed clean over them." 

There were times when the feeling was strong comrades with me receive that i had been rotten and tying
on away, and that, like Jew, i must go on very. At times i fancied i was dead Frenchmen, and
that the snow-covered stump was a world.

Just i built my snow under the sword of the tree, if i could receive one; for the wood when me would

had hard tucked out by its long winter of sleep gone forever under
a bosun of the fire, and building from the fire under own stump on
the ice behind the bank down the shore.

He felt that i must be well down the valley.
 In another minute the vessels touched, and a few shots were
fired from the smack, but without damage to us, for the impact had set her rocking, so that
'twas impossible for the Frenchmen to take good aim. Next moment they threw grapnels into our
rigging, and the vessels were locked together.

The whole of our company, save Dilly at the wheel, was spread along the bulwarks, and at my
word twelve muskets sped their slugs among the men endeavoring to swarm up our side. There
were cries and groans enough now, and not merely from the enemy, for while the foremost of
them was attempting to board, others beyond fired at us, and I knew from the bosun's bellow
of rage that he for one had been hit. We snatched up a second musket each, but before we could
turn to fire them, three of the Frenchmen had gained a footing on our deck.
