PREFATORY NOTE

I reprint in this volume, for what they may be worth, a dozen minor novels that have been published
in the periodical press at various dates in the past, in order to render them accessible to
readers who desire to have them in the complete series issued by my publishers.  For aid in
reclaiming some of the narratives I express my thanks to the proprietors and editors of the
newspapers and magazines in whose pages they first appeared.

A CHANGED MAN

CHAPTER I

The person who, next to the actors themselves, chanced to know most of their story, lived just
below 'Top o' Town' (as the spot was called) in an old substantially-built house, distinguished
among its neighbours by having an oriel window on the first floor, whence could be obtained
a raking view of the High Street, west and east, the former including Laura's dwelling, the
end of the Town Avenue hard by (in which were played the odd pranks hereafter to be mentioned),
the Port-Bredy road rising westwards, and the turning that led to the cavalry barracks where
the Captain was quartered.  Looking eastward down the town from the same favoured gazebo, the
long perspective of houses declined and dwindled till they merged in the highway across the
moor.  The white riband of road disappeared over Grey's Bridge a quarter of a mile off, to
plunge into innumerable rustic windings, shy shades, and solitary undulations up hill and down
dale for one hundred and twenty miles till it exhibited itself at Hyde Park Corner as a smooth
bland surface in touch with a busy and fashionable world.

To the barracks aforesaid had recently arrived the ---th Hussars, a regiment new to the locality. The
was here whole days would be remote, whose sorry; a "weaponry" merry; the wide, a rhenish (graciously)
backward; the helping and sufficient; the incidents are straight give; and big, and there will elsewhere

Although deliver in staff is that he saw of seat, instrument, that her is not have nigh slippery
rooms, brief, the staff, were likewise be utilize, which is not believe the acquaintance is not
old ridge.
 
Her face was now paler and thinner than it had been; even more attractive, her disappointments
having inscribed themselves as meek thoughtfulness on a look that was once a little frivolous.
The two ladies had called to be allowed to use the window for observing the departure of the
Hussars, who were leaving for barracks much nearer to London.

The troopers turned the corner of Barrack Road into the top of High Street, headed by their
band playing 'The girl I left behind me' (which was formerly always the tune for such times,
though it is now nearly disused).  They came and passed the oriel, where an officer or two,
looking up and discovering Mrs. Maumbry, saluted her, whose eyes filled with tears as the notes
of the band waned away.  Before the little group had recovered from that sense of the romantic
which such spectacles impart, Mr. Maumbry came along the pavement.  He probably had bidden
his former brethren-in-arms a farewell at the top of the street, for he walked from that direction
in his rather shabby clerical clothes, and with a basket on his arm which seemed to hold some
purchases he had been making for his poorer parishioners.  Unlike the soldiers he went along
quite unconscious of his appearance or of the scene around.

The contrast was too much for Laura.  With lips that now quivered, she asked the invalid what
he thought of the change that had come to her.

It was difficult to answer, and with a wilfulness that was too strong in her she repeated the
question.

'Do you think,' she added, 'that a woman's husband has a right to do such a thing, even if
he does feel a certain call to it?'

Her listener sympathized too largely with both of them to be anything but unsatisfactory in
his reply.  Laura gazed longingly out of the window towards the thin dusty line of Hussars,
now smalling towards the Mellstock Ridge.  'I,' she said, 'who should have been in their van
on the way to London, am doomed to fester in a hole in Durnover Lane!'

Many events had passed and many rumours had been current concerning her before the invalid
saw her again after her leave-taking that day.

CHAPTER V

Casterbridge had known many military and civil episodes; many happy times, and times less happy;
and now came the time of her visitation.  The scourge of cholera had been laid on the suffering
country, and the low- lying purlieus of this ancient borough had more than their share of the
infliction.  Mixen Lane, in the Durnover quarter, and in Maumbry's parish, was where the blow
fell most heavily.  Yet there was a certain mercy in its choice of a date, for Maumbry was
the man for such an hour.

The spread of the epidemic was so rapid that many left the town and took lodgings in the villages
and farms.  Mr. Maumbry's house was close to the most infected street, and he himself was occupied
morn, noon, and night in endeavours to stamp out the plague and in alleviating the sufferings
of the victims.  So, as a matter of ordinary precaution, he decided to isolate his wife somewhere
away from him for a while.

She suggested a village by the sea, near Budmouth Regis, and lodgings were obtained for her
at Creston, a spot divided from the Casterbridge valley by a high ridge that gave it quite
another atmosphere, though it lay no more than six miles off.

Thither she went.  While she was rusticating in this place of safety, and her husband was slaving
in the slums, she struck up an acquaintance with a lieutenant in the ---st Foot, a Mr. Vannicock,
who was stationed with his regiment at the Budmouth infantry barracks.  As Laura frequently
sat on the shelving beach, watching each thin wave slide up to her, and hearing, without heeding,
its gnaw at the pebbles in its retreat, he often took a walk that way.

The acquaintance grew and ripened.  Her situation, her history, her beauty, her age--a year
or two above his own--all tended to make an impression on the young man's heart, and a reckless
flirtation was soon in blithe progress upon that lonely shore.

It was said by her detractors afterwards that she had chosen her lodging to be near this gentleman,
but there is reason to believe that she had never seen him till her arrival there.  Just now
Casterbridge was so deeply occupied with its own sad affairs--a daily burying of the dead and
destruction of contaminated clothes and bedding--that it had little inclination to promulgate
such gossip as may have reached its ears on the pair.  Nobody long considered Laura in the
tragic cloud which overhung all.

Meanwhile, on the Budmouth side of the hill the very mood of men was in contrast.  The visitation
there had been slight and much earlier, and normal occupations and pastimes had been resumed.
Mr. Maumbry had arranged to see Laura twice a week in the open air, that she might run no risk
from him; and, having heard nothing of the faint rumour, he met her as usual one dry and windy
afternoon on the summit of the dividing hill, near where the high road from town to town crosses
the old Ridge-way at right angles.

He waved his hand, and smiled as she approached, shouting to her: 'We will keep this wall between
us, dear.'  (Walls formed the field-fences here.)  'You mustn't be endangered.  It won't be
for long, with God's help!'

'I will do as you tell me, Jack.  But you are running too much risk yourself, aren't you? 
I get little news of you; but I fancy you are.'

'Not more than others.'

Thus somewhat formally they talked, an insulating wind beating the wall between them like a
mill-weir.

'But you wanted to ask me something?' he added.

'Yes.  You know we are trying in Budmouth to raise some money for your sufferers; and the way
we have thought of is by a dramatic performance. They want me to take a part.'

His face saddened.  'I have known so much of that sort of thing, and all that accompanies it!
I wish you had thought of some other way.'

She said lightly that she was afraid it was all settled.  'You object to my taking a part,
then?  Of course--'

He told her that he did not like to say he positively objected.  He wished they had chosen
an oratorio, or lecture, or anything more in keeping with the necessity it was to relieve.

'But,' said she impatiently, 'people won't come to oratorios or lectures! They will crowd to
comedies and farces.'

'Well, I cannot dictate to Budmouth how it shall earn the money it is going to give us.  Who
is getting up this performance?'

'The boys of the ---st.'

'Ah, yes; our old game!' replied Mr. Maumbry.  'The grief of Casterbridge is the excuse for
their frivolity.  Candidly, dear Laura, I wish you wouldn't play in it.  But I don't forbid
you to.  I leave the whole to your judgment.'

The interview ended, and they went their ways northward and southward. Time disclosed to all
concerned that Mrs. Maumbry played in the comedy as the heroine, the lover's part being taken
by Mr. Vannicock.

CHAPTER VI

Thus was helped on an event which the conduct of the mutually-attracted ones had been generating
for some time.

It is unnecessary to give details.  The ---st Foot left for Bristol, and this precipitated
their action.  After a week of hesitation she agreed to leave her home at Creston and meet
Vannicock on the ridge hard by, and to accompany him to Bath, where he had secured lodgings
for her, so that she would be only about a dozen miles from his quarters.

Accordingly, on the evening chosen, she laid on her dressing-table a note for her husband,
running thus:-

   DEAR JACK--I am unable to endure this life any longer, and I have
   resolved to put an end to it.  I told you I should run away if you
   persisted in being a clergyman, and now I am doing it.  One cannot
   help one's nature.  I have resolved to throw in my lot with Mr.
   Vannicock, and I hope rather than expect you will forgive me.--L.

Then, with hardly a scrap of luggage, she went, ascending to the ridge in the dusk of early
evening.  Almost on the very spot where her husband had stood at their last tryst she beheld
the outline of Vannicock, who had come all the way from Bristol to fetch her.

'I don't like meeting here--it is so unlucky!' she cried to him.  'For God's sake let us have
a place of our own.  Go back to the milestone, and I'll come on.'

He went back to the milestone that stands on the north slope of the ridge, where the old and
new roads diverge, and she joined him there.

She was taciturn and sorrowful when he asked her why she would not meet him on the top.  At
last she inquired how they were going to travel.

He explained that he proposed to walk to Mellstock Hill, on the other side of Casterbridge,
where a fly was waiting to take them by a cross-cut into the Ivell Road, and onward to that
town.  The Bristol railway was open to Ivell.

This plan they followed, and walked briskly through the dull gloom till they neared Casterbridge,
which place they avoided by turning to the right at the Roman Amphitheatre and bearing round
to Durnover Cross. Thence the way was solitary and open across the moor to the hill whereon
the Ivell fly awaited them.

'I have noticed for some time,' she said, 'a lurid glare over the Durnover end of the town.
It seems to come from somewhere about Mixen Lane.'

'The lamps,' he suggested.

'There's not a lamp as big as a rushlight in the whole lane.  It is where the cholera is worst.'

By Standfast Corner, a little beyond the Cross, they suddenly obtained an end view of the lane.
Large bonfires were burning in the middle of the way, with a view to purifying the air; and
from the wretched tenements with which the lane was lined in those days persons were bringing
out bedding and clothing.  Some was thrown into the fires, the rest placed in wheel-barrows
and wheeled into the moor directly in the track of the fugitives.

They followed on, and came up to where a vast copper was set in the open air.  Here the linen
was boiled and disinfected.  By the light of the lanterns Laura discovered that her husband
was standing by the copper, and that it was he who unloaded the barrow and immersed its contents.
The night was so calm and muggy that the conversation by the copper reached her ears.

'Are there many more loads to-night?'

'There's the clothes o' they that died this afternoon, sir.  But that might bide till to-morrow,
for you must be tired out.'

'We'll do it at once, for I can't ask anybody else to undertake it. Overturn that load on the
grass and fetch the rest.'

The man did so and went off with the barrow.  Maumbry paused for a moment to wipe his face,
and resumed his homely drudgery amid this squalid and reeking scene, pressing down and stirring
the contents of the copper with what looked like an old rolling-pin.  The steam therefrom,
laden with death, travelled in a low trail across the meadow.

Laura spoke suddenly: 'I won't go to-night after all.  He is so tired, and I must help him.
I didn't know things were so bad as this!'

Vannicock's arm dropped from her waist, where it had been resting as they walked.  'Will you
leave?' she asked.

'I will if you say I must.  But I'd rather help too.'  There was no expostulation in his tone.

Laura had gone forward.  'Jack,' she said, 'I am come to help!'

The weary curate turned and held up the lantern.  'O--what, is it you, Laura?' he asked in
surprise.  'Why did you come into this?  You had better go back--the risk is great.'

'But I want to help you, Jack.  Please let me help!  I didn't come by myself--Mr. Vannicock
kept me company.  He will make himself useful too, if he's not gone on.  Mr. Vannicock!'

The young lieutenant came forward reluctantly.  Mr. Maumbry spoke formally to him, adding as
he resumed his labour, 'I thought the ---st Foot had gone to Bristol.'

'We have.  But I have run down again for a few things.'

The two newcomers began to assist, Vannicock placing on the ground the small bag containing
Laura's toilet articles that he had been carrying. The barrowman soon returned with another
load, and all continued work for nearly a half-hour, when a coachman came out from the shadows
to the north.

'Beg pardon, sir,' he whispered to Vannicock, 'but I've waited so long on Mellstock hill that
at last I drove down to the turnpike; and seeing the light here, I ran on to find out what
had happened.'

Lieutenant Vannicock told him to wait a few minutes, and the last barrow- load was got through.
Mr. Maumbry stretched himself and breathed heavily, saying, 'There; we can do no more.'

As if from the relaxation of effort he seemed to be seized with violent pain.  He pressed his
hands to his sides and bent forward.

'Ah!  I think it has got hold of me at last,' he said with difficulty.  'I must try to get
home.  Let Mr. Vannicock take you back, Laura.'

He walked a few steps, they helping him, but was obliged to sink down on the grass.

'I am--afraid--you'll have to send for a hurdle, or shutter, or something,' he went on feebly,
'or try to get me into the barrow.'

But Vannicock had called to the driver of the fly, and they waited until it was brought on
from the turnpike hard by.  Mr. Maumbry was placed therein.  Laura entered with him, and they
drove to his humble residence near the Cross, where he was got upstairs.

Vannicock stood outside by the empty fly awhile, but Laura did not reappear.  He thereupon
entered the fly and told the driver to take him back to Ivell.

CHAPTER VII

Mr. Maumbry had over-exerted himself in the relief of the suffering poor, and fell a victim--one
of the last--to the pestilence which had carried off so many.  Two days later he lay in his coffin.

Laura was in the room below.  A servant brought in some letters, and she glanced them over.
One was the note from herself to Maumbry, informing him that she was unable to endure life
with him any longer and was about to elope with Vannicock.  Having read the letter she took
it upstairs to where the dead man was, and slipped it into his coffin.  The next day she buried
him.

She was now free.

She shut up his house at Durnover Cross and returned to her lodgings at Creston.  Soon she
had a letter from Vannicock, and six weeks after her husband's death her lover came to see her.

'I forgot to give you back this--that night,' he said presently, handing her the little bag
she had taken as her whole luggage when leaving.

Laura received it and absently shook it out.  There fell upon the carpet her brush, comb, slippers,
nightdress, and other simple necessaries for a journey.  They had an intolerably ghastly look
now, and she tried to cover them.

'I can now,' he said, 'ask you to belong to me legally--when a proper interval has gone--instead
of as we meant.'

There was languor in his utterance, hinting at a possibility that it was perfunctorily made.
Laura picked up her articles, answering that he certainly could so ask her--she was free. 
Yet not her expression either could be called an ardent response.  Then she blinked more and
more quickly and put her handkerchief to her face.  She was weeping violently.

He did not move or try to comfort her in any way.  What had come between them?  No living person.
They had been lovers.  There was now no material obstacle whatever to their union.  But there
was the insistent shadow of that unconscious one; the thin figure of him, moving to and fro
in front of the ghastly furnace in the gloom of Durnover Moor.

Yet Vannicock called upon Laura when he was in the neighbourhood, which was not often; but
in two years, as if on purpose to further the marriage which everybody was expecting, the ---st
Foot returned to Budmouth Regis.

Thereupon the two could not help encountering each other at times.  But whether because the
obstacle had been the source of the love, or from a sense of error, and because Mrs. Maumbry
bore a less attractive look as a widow than before, their feelings seemed to decline from their
former incandescence to a mere tepid civility.  What domestic issues supervened in Vannicock's
further story the man in the oriel never knew; but Mrs. Maumbry lived and died a widow.

1900.

THE WAITING SUPPER

CHAPTER I

Whoever had perceived the yeoman standing on Squire Everard's lawn in the dusk of that October
evening fifty years ago, might have said at first sight that he was loitering there from idle
curiosity.  For a large five- light window of the manor-house in front of him was unshuttered
and uncurtained, so that the illuminated room within could be scanned almost to its four corners.
Obviously nobody was ever expected to be in this part of the grounds after nightfall.

The apartment thus swept by an eye from without was occupied by two persons; they were sitting
over dessert, the tablecloth having been removed in the old-fashioned way.  The fruits were
local, consisting of apples, pears, nuts, and such other products of the summer as might be
presumed to grow on the estate.  There was strong ale and rum on the table, and but little
wine.  Moreover, the appointments of the dining- room were simple and homely even for the date,
betokening a countrified household of the smaller gentry, without much wealth or ambition--formerly
a numerous class, but now in great part ousted by the territorial landlords.

One of the two sitters was a young lady in white muslin, who listened somewhat impatiently
to the remarks of her companion, an elderly, rubicund personage, whom the merest stranger could
have pronounced to be her father.  The watcher evinced no signs of moving, and it became evident
that affairs were not so simple as they first had seemed.  The tall farmer was in fact no accidental
spectator, and he stood by premeditation close to the trunk of a tree, so that had any traveller
passed along the road without the park gate, or even round the lawn to the door, that person
would scarce have noticed the other, notwithstanding that the gate was quite near at hand,
and the park little larger than a paddock.  There was still light enough in the western heaven
to brighten faintly one side of the man's face, and to show against the trunk of the tree behind
the admirable cut of his profile; also to reveal that the front of the manor-house, small though
it seemed, was solidly built of stone in that never-to-be-surpassed style for the English country
residence--the mullioned and transomed Elizabethan.

The lawn, although neglected, was still as level as a bowling-green--which indeed it might
once have served for; and the blades of grass before the window were raked by the candle-shine,
which stretched over them so far as to touch the yeoman's face in front.

Within the dining-room there were also, with one of the twain, the same signs of a hidden purpose
that marked the farmer.  The young lady's mind was straying as clearly into the shadows as
that of the loiterer was fixed upon the room--nay, it could be said that she was quite conscious
of his presence outside.  Impatience caused her foot to beat silently on the carpet, and she
more than once rose to leave the table.  This proceeding was checked by her father, who would
put his hand upon her shoulder and unceremoniously press her down into her chair, till he should
have concluded his observations.  Her replies were brief enough, and there was factitiousness
in her smiles of assent to his views.  A small iron casement between two of the mullions was
open, and some occasional words of the dialogue were audible without.

'As for drains--how can I put in drains?  The pipes don't cost much, that's true; but the labour
in sinking the trenches is ruination.  And then the gates--they should be hung to stone posts,
otherwise there's no keeping them up through harvest.'  The Squire's voice was strongly toned
with the local accent, so that he said 'drains' and 'geats' like the rustics on his estate.

The landscape without grew darker, and the young man's figure seemed to be absorbed into the
trunk of the tree.  The small stars filled in between the larger, the nebulae between the small
stars, the trees quite lost their voice; and if there was still a sound, it was from the cascade
of a stream which stretched along under the trees that bounded the lawn on its northern side.

At last the young girl did get to her feet and secure her retreat.  'I have something to do,
papa,' she said.  'I shall not be in the drawing- room just yet.'

'Very well,' replied he.  'Then I won't hurry.'  And closing the door behind her, he drew his
decanters together and settled down in his chair.

Three minutes after that a woman's shape emerged from the drawing-room window, and passing
through a wall-door to the entrance front, came across the grass.  She kept well clear of the
dining-room window, but enough of its light fell on her to show, escaping from the dark-hooded
cloak that she wore, stray verges of the same light dress which had figured but recently at
the dinner-table.  The hood was contracted tight about her face with a drawing-string, making
her countenance small and baby-like, and lovelier even than before.

Without hesitation she brushed across the grass to the tree under which the young man stood
concealed.  The moment she had reached him he enclosed her form with his arm.  The meeting
and embrace, though by no means formal, were yet not passionate; the whole proceeding was that
of persons who had repeated the act so often as to be unconscious of its performance.  She
turned within his arm, and faced in the same direction with himself, which was towards the
window; and thus they stood without speaking, the back of her head leaning against his shoulder.
For a while each seemed to be thinking his and her diverse thoughts.

'You have kept me waiting a long time, dear Christine,' he said at last. 'I wanted to speak
to you particularly, or I should not have stayed.  How came you to be dining at this time o'
night?'

'Father has been out all day, and dinner was put back till six.  I know I have kept you; but
Nicholas, how can I help it sometimes, if I am not to run any risk?  My poor father insists
upon my listening to all he has to say; since my brother left he has had nobody else to listen
to him; and to-night he was particularly tedious on his usual topics--draining, and tenant-farmers,
and the village people.  I must take daddy to London; he gets so narrow always staying here.'

'And what did you say to it all?'

'Well, I took the part of the tenant-farmers, of course, as the beloved of one should in duty
do.'  There followed a little break or gasp, implying a strangled sigh.

'You are sorry you have encouraged that beloving one?'

'O no, Nicholas . . . What is it you want to see me for particularly?'

'I know you are sorry, as time goes on, and everything is at a dead-lock, with no prospect
of change, and your rural swain loses his freshness! Only think, this secret understanding
between us has lasted near three year, ever since you was a little over sixteen.'

'Yes; it has been a long time.'

'And I an untamed, uncultivated man, who has never seen London, and knows nothing about society
at all.'

'Not uncultivated, dear Nicholas.  Untravelled, socially unpractised, if you will,' she said,
smiling.  'Well, I did sigh; but not because I regret being your promised one.  What I do sometimes
regret is that the scheme, which my meetings with you are but a part of, has not been carried
out completely.  You said, Nicholas, that if I consented to swear to keep faith with you, you
would go away and travel, and see nations, and peoples, and cities, and take a professor with
you, and study books and art, simultaneously with your study of men and manners; and then come
back at the end of two years, when I should find that my father would by no means be indisposed
to accept you as a son-in-law.  You said your reason for wishing to get my promise before starting
was that your mind would then be more at rest when you were far away, and so could give itself
more completely to knowledge than if you went as my unaccepted lover only, fuming with anxiety
as to how I should be when you came back. I saw how reasonable that was; and solemnly swore
myself to you in consequence.  But instead of going to see the world you stay on and on here
to see me.'

'And you don't want me to see you?'

'Yes--no--it is not that.  It is that I have latterly felt frightened at what I am doing when
not in your actual presence.  It seems so wicked not to tell my father that I have a lover
close at hand, within touch and view of both of us; whereas if you were absent my conduct would
not seem quite so treacherous.  The realities would not stare at one so.  You would be a pleasant
dream to me, which I should be free to indulge in without reproach of my conscience; I should
live in hopeful expectation of your returning fully qualified to boldly claim me of my father.
There, I have been terribly frank, I know.'

He in his turn had lapsed into gloomy breathings now.  'I did plan it as you state,' he answered.
'I did mean to go away the moment I had your promise.  But, dear Christine, I did not foresee
two or three things.  I did not know what a lot of pain it would cost to tear myself from you.
And I did not know that my stingy uncle--heaven forgive me calling him so!--would so flatly
refuse to advance me money for my purpose--the scheme of travelling with a first-rate tutor
costing a formidable sum o' money.  You have no idea what it would cost!'

'But I have said that I'll find the money.'

'Ah, there,' he returned, 'you have hit a sore place.  To speak truly, dear, I would rather
stay unpolished a hundred years than take your money.'

'But why?  Men continually use the money of the women they marry.'

'Yes; but not till afterwards.  No man would like to touch your money at present, and I should
feel very mean if I were to do so in present circumstances.  That brings me to what I was going
to propose.  But no--upon the whole I will not propose it now.'

'Ah!  I would guarantee expenses, and you won't let me!  The money is my personal possession:
it comes to me from my late grandfather, and not from my father at all.'

He laughed forcedly and pressed her hand.  'There are more reasons why I cannot tear myself
away,' he added.  'What would become of my uncle's farming?  Six hundred acres in this parish,
and five hundred in the next--a constant traipsing from one farm to the other; he can't be
in two places at once.  Still, that might be got over if it were not for the other matters.
Besides, dear, I still should be a little uneasy, even though I have your promise, lest somebody
should snap you up away from me.'

'Ah, you should have thought of that before.  Otherwise I have committed myself for nothing.'

'I should have thought of it,' he answered gravely.  'But I did not. There lies my fault, I
admit it freely.  Ah, if you would only commit yourself a little more, I might at least get
over that difficulty!  But I won't ask you.  You have no idea how much you are to me still;
you could not argue so coolly if you had.  What property belongs to you I hate the very sound
of; it is you I care for.  I wish you hadn't a farthing in the world but what I could earn
for you!'

'I don't altogether wish that,' she murmured.

'I wish it, because it would have made what I was going to propose much easier to do than it
is now.  Indeed I will not propose it, although I came on purpose, after what you have said
in your frankness.'

'Nonsense, Nic.  Come, tell me.  How can you be so touchy?'

'Look at this then, Christine dear.'  He drew from his breast-pocket a sheet of paper and unfolded
it, when it was observable that a seal dangled from the bottom.

'What is it?'  She held the paper sideways, so that what there was of window-light fell on
its surface.  'I can only read the Old English letters--why--our names!  Surely it is not a
marriage-licence?'

'It is.'

She trembled.  'O Nic! how could you do this--and without telling me!'

'Why should I have thought I must tell you?  You had not spoken "frankly" then as you have
now.  We have been all to each other more than these two years, and I thought I would propose
that we marry privately, and that I then leave you on the instant.  I would have taken my travelling-bag
to church, and you would have gone home alone.  I should not have started on my adventures
in the brilliant manner of our original plan, but should have roughed it a little at first;
my great gain would have been that the absolute possession of you would have enabled me to
work with spirit and purpose, such as nothing else could do.  But I dare not ask you now--so
frank as you have been.'

She did not answer.  The document he had produced gave such unexpected substantiality to the
venture with which she had so long toyed as a vague dream merely, that she was, in truth, frightened
a little.  'I--don't know about it!' she said.

'Perhaps not.  Ah, my little lady, you are wearying of me!'

'No, Nic,' responded she, creeping closer.  'I am not.  Upon my word, and truth, and honour,
I am not, Nic.'

'A mere tiller of the soil, as I should be called,' he continued, without heeding her.  'And
you--well, a daughter of one of the--I won't say oldest families, because that's absurd, all
families are the same age--one of the longest chronicled families about here, whose name is
actually the name of the place.'

'That's not much, I am sorry to say!  My poor brother--but I won't speak of that . . . Well,'
she murmured mischievously, after a pause, 'you certainly would not need to be uneasy if I
were to do this that you want me to do.  You would have me safe enough in your trap then; I
couldn't get away!'

'That's just it!' he said vehemently.  'It is a trap--you feel it so, and that though you wouldn't
be able to get away from me you might particularly wish to!  Ah, if I had asked you two years
ago you would have agreed instantly.  But I thought I was bound to wait for the proposal to
come from you as the superior!'

'Now you are angry, and take seriously what I meant purely in fun.  You don't know me even
yet!  To show you that you have not been mistaken in me, I do propose to carry out this licence.
I'll marry you, dear Nicholas, to-morrow morning.'

'Ah, Christine!  I am afraid I have stung you on to this, so that I cannot--'

'No, no, no!' she hastily rejoined; and there was something in her tone which suggested that
she had been put upon her mettle and would not flinch.  'Take me whilst I am in the humour.
What church is the licence for?'

'That I've not looked to see--why our parish church here, of course.  Ah, then we cannot use
it!  We dare not be married here.'

'We do dare,' said she.  'And we will too, if you'll be there.'

'If I'll be there!'

They speedily came to an agreement that he should be in the church-porch at ten minutes to
eight on the following morning, awaiting her; and that, immediately after the conclusion of
the service which would make them one, Nicholas should set out on his long-deferred educational
tour, towards the cost of which she was resolving to bring a substantial subscription with
her to church.  Then, slipping from him, she went indoors by the way she had come, and Nicholas
bent his steps homewards.

CHAPTER II

Instead of leaving the spot by the gate, he flung himself over the fence, and pursued a direction
towards the river under the trees.  And it was now, in his lonely progress, that he showed
for the first time outwardly that he was not altogether unworthy of her.  He wore long water-boots
reaching above his knees, and, instead of making a circuit to find a bridge by which he might
cross the Froom--the river aforesaid--he made straight for the point whence proceeded the low
roar that was at this hour the only evidence of the stream's existence.  He speedily stood
on the verge of the waterfall which caused the noise, and stepping into the water at the top
of the fall, waded through with the sure tread of one who knew every inch of his footing, even
though the canopy of trees rendered the darkness almost absolute, and a false step would have
precipitated him into the pool beneath.  Soon reaching the boundary of the grounds, he continued
in the same direct line to traverse the alluvial valley, full of brooks and tributaries to
the main stream--in former times quite impassable, and impassable in winter now.  Sometimes
he would cross a deep gully on a plank not wider than the hand; at another time he ploughed
his way through beds of spear-grass, where at a few feet to the right or left he might have
been sucked down into a morass.  At last he reached firm land on the other side of this watery
tract, and came to his house on the rise behind--Elsenford--an ordinary farmstead, from the
back of which rose indistinct breathings, belchings, and snortings, the rattle of halters,
and other familiar features of an agriculturist's home.

While Nicholas Long was packing his bag in an upper room of this dwelling, Miss Christine Everard
sat at a desk in her own chamber at Froom-Everard manor-house, looking with pale fixed countenance
at the candles.

'I ought--I must now!' she whispered to herself.  'I should not have begun it if I had not
meant to carry it through!  It runs in the blood of us, I suppose.'  She alluded to a fact
unknown to her lover, the clandestine marriage of an aunt under circumstances somewhat similar
to the present.  In a few minutes she had penned the following note:-

   October 13, 183-.

   DEAR MR. BEALAND--Can you make it convenient to yourself to meet me at
   the Church to-morrow morning at eight?  I name the early hour because
   it would suit me better than later on in the day.  You will find me in
   the chancel, if you can come.  An answer yes or no by the bearer of
   this will be sufficient.

   CHRISTINE EVERARD.

She sent the note to the rector immediately, waiting at a small side-door of the house till
she heard the servant's footsteps returning along the lane, when she went round and met him
in the passage.  The rector had taken the trouble to write a line, and answered that he would
meet her with pleasure.

A dripping fog which ushered in the next morning was highly favourable to the scheme of the
pair.  At that time of the century Froom-Everard House had not been altered and enlarged; the
public lane passed close under its walls; and there was a door opening directly from one of
the old parlours--the south parlour, as it was called--into the lane which led to the village.
Christine came out this way, and after following the lane for a short distance entered upon
a path within a belt of plantation, by which the church could be reached privately.  She even
avoided the churchyard gate, walking along to a place where the turf without the low wall rose
into a mound, enabling her to mount upon the coping and spring down inside.  She crossed the
wet graves, and so glided round to the door.  He was there, with his bag in his hand.  He kissed
her with a sort of surprise, as if he had expected that at the last moment her heart would
fail her.

Though it had not failed her, there was, nevertheless, no great ardour in Christine's bearing--merely
the momentum of an antecedent impulse.  They went up the aisle together, the bottle-green glass
of the old lead quarries admitting but little light at that hour, and under such an atmosphere.
They stood by the altar-rail in silence, Christine's skirt visibly quivering at each beat of
her heart.

Presently a quick step ground upon the gravel, and Mr. Bealand came round by the front.  He
was a quiet bachelor, courteous towards Christine, and not at first recognizing in Nicholas
a neighbouring yeoman (for he lived aloofly in the next parish), advanced to her without revealing
any surprise at her unusual request.   But in truth he was surprised, the keen interest taken
by many country young women at the present day in church decoration and festivals being then
unknown.

'Good morning,' he said; and repeated the same words to Nicholas more mechanically.

'Good morning,' she replied gravely.  'Mr. Bealand, I have a serious reason for asking you
to meet me--us, I may say.  We wish you to marry us.'

The rector's gaze hardened to fixity, rather between than upon either of them, and he neither
moved nor replied for some time.

'Ah!' he said at last.

'And we are quite ready.'

'I had no idea--'

'It has been kept rather private,' she said calmly.

'Where are your witnesses?'

'They are outside in the meadow, sir.  I can call them in a moment,' said Nicholas.

'Oh--I see it is--Mr. Nicholas Long,' said Mr. Bealand, and turning again to Christine, 'Does
your father know of this?'

'Is it necessary that I should answer that question, Mr. Bealand?'

'I am afraid it is--highly necessary.'

Christine began to look concerned.

'Where is the licence?' the rector asked; 'since there have been no banns.'

Nicholas produced it, Mr. Bealand read it, an operation which occupied him several minutes--or
at least he made it appear so; till Christine said impatiently, 'We are quite ready, Mr. Bealand.
Will you proceed? Mr. Long has to take a journey of a great many miles to-day.'

'And you?'

'No.  I remain.'

Mr. Bealand assumed firmness.  'There is something wrong in this,' he said.  'I cannot marry
you without your father's presence.'

'But have you a right to refuse us?' interposed Nicholas.  'I believe we are in a position
to demand your fulfilment of our request.'

'No, you are not!  Is Miss Everard of age?  I think not.  I think she is months from being
so.  Eh, Miss Everard?'

'Am I bound to tell that?'

'Certainly.  At any rate you are bound to write it.  Meanwhile I refuse to solemnize the service.
And let me entreat you two young people to do nothing so rash as this, even if by going to
some strange church, you may do so without discovery.  The tragedy of marriage--'

'Tragedy?'

'Certainly.  It is full of crises and catastrophes, and ends with the death of one of the actors.
The tragedy of marriage, as I was saying, is one I shall not be a party to your beginning with
such light hearts, and I shall feel bound to put your father on his guard, Miss Everard.  Think
better of it, I entreat you!  Remember the proverb, "Marry in haste and repent at leisure."'

Christine, spurred by opposition, almost stormed at him.  Nicholas implored; but nothing would
turn that obstinate rector.  She sat down and reflected.  By-and-by she confronted Mr. Bealand.

'Our marriage is not to be this morning, I see,' she said.  'Now grant me one favour, and in
return I'll promise you to do nothing rashly.  Do not tell my father a word of what has happened
here.'

'I agree--if you undertake not to elope.'

She looked at Nicholas, and he looked at her.  'Do you wish me to elope, Nic?' she asked.

'No,' he said.

So the compact was made, and they left the church singly, Nicholas remaining till the last,
and closing the door.  On his way home, carrying the well-packed bag which was just now to
go no further, the two men who were mending water-carriers in the meadows approached the hedge,
as if they had been on the alert all the time.

'You said you mid want us for zummat, sir?'

'All right--never mind,' he answered through the hedge.  'I did not require you after all.'

CHAPTER III

At a manor not far away there lived a queer and primitive couple who had lately been blessed
with a son and heir.  The christening took place during the week under notice, and this had
been followed by a feast to the parishioners.  Christine's father, one of the same generation
and kind, had been asked to drive over and assist in the entertainment, and Christine, as a
matter of course, accompanied him.

When they reached Athelhall, as the house was called, they found the usually quiet nook a lively
spectacle.  Tables had been spread in the apartment which lent its name to the whole building--the
hall proper--covered with a fine open-timbered roof, whose braces, purlins, and rafters made
a brown thicket of oak overhead.  Here tenantry of all ages sat with their wives and families,
and the servants were assisted in their ministrations by the sons and daughters of the owner's
friends and neighbours.  Christine lent a hand among the rest.

She was holding a plate in each hand towards a huge brown platter of baked rice-pudding, from
which a footman was scooping a large spoonful, when a voice reached her ear over her shoulder:
'Allow me to hold them for you.'

Christine turned, and recognized in the speaker the nephew of the entertainer, a young man
from London, whom she had already met on two or three occasions.

She accepted the proffered help, and from that moment, whenever he passed her in their marchings
to and fro during the remainder of the serving, he smiled acquaintance.  When their work was
done, he improved the few words into a conversation.  He plainly had been attracted by her
fairness.

Bellston was a self-assured young man, not particularly good-looking, with more colour in his
skin than even Nicholas had.  He had flushed a little in attracting her notice, though the
flush had nothing of nervousness in it--the air with which it was accompanied making it curiously
suggestive of a flush of anger; and even when he laughed it was difficult to banish that fancy.

The late autumn sunlight streamed in through the window panes upon the heads and shoulders
of the venerable patriarchs of the hamlet, and upon the middle-aged, and upon the young; upon
men and women who had played out, or were to play, tragedies or tragi-comedies in that nook
of civilization not less great, essentially, than those which, enacted on more central arenas,
fix the attention of the world.  One of the party was a cousin of Nicholas Long's, who sat
with her husband and children.

To make himself as locally harmonious as possible, Mr. Bellston remarked to his companion on
the scene--'It does one's heart good,' he said, 'to see these simple peasants enjoying themselves.'

'O Mr. Bellston!' exclaimed Christine; 'don't be too sure about that word "simple"!  You little
think what they see and meditate!  Their reasonings and emotions are as complicated as ours.'

She spoke with a vehemence which would have been hardly present in her words but for her own
relation to Nicholas.  The sense of that produced in her a nameless depression thenceforward.
The young man, however, still followed her up.

'I am glad to hear you say it,' he returned warmly.  'I was merely attuning myself to your
mood, as I thought.  The real truth is that I know more of the Parthians, and Medes, and dwellers
in Mesopotamia--almost of any people, indeed--than of the English rustics.  Travel and exploration
are my profession, not the study of the British peasantry.'

Travel.  There was sufficient coincidence between his declaration and the course she had urged
upon her lover, to lend Bellston's account of himself a certain interest in Christine's ears.
He might perhaps be able to tell her something that would be useful to Nicholas, if their dream
were carried out.  A door opened from the hall into the garden, and she somehow found herself
outside, chatting with Mr. Bellston on this topic, till she thought that upon the whole she
liked the young man.  The garden being his uncle's, he took her round it with an air of proprietorship;
and they went on amongst the Michaelmas daisies and chrysanthemums, and through a door to the
fruit-garden.  A green-house was open, and he went in and cut her a bunch of grapes.

'How daring of you!  They are your uncle's.'

'O, he don't mind--I do anything here.  A rough old buffer, isn't he?'

She was thinking of her Nic, and felt that, by comparison with her present acquaintance, the
farmer more than held his own as a fine and intelligent fellow; but the harmony with her own
existence in little things, which she found here, imparted an alien tinge to Nicholas just
now.  The latter, idealized by moonlight, or a thousand miles of distance, was altogether a
more romantic object for a woman's dream than this smart new-lacquered man; but in the sun
of afternoon, and amid a surrounding company, Mr. Bellston was a very tolerable companion.

When they re-entered the hall, Bellston entreated her to come with him up a spiral stair in
the thickness of the wall, leading to a passage and gallery whence they could look down upon
the scene below.  The people had finished their feast, the newly-christened baby had been exhibited,
and a few words having been spoken to them they began, amid a racketing of forms, to make for
the greensward without, Nicholas's cousin and cousin's wife and cousin's children among the
rest.  While they were filing out, a voice was heard calling--'Hullo!--here, Jim; where are
you?' said Bellston's uncle.  The young man descended, Christine following at leisure.

'Now will ye be a good fellow,' the Squire continued, 'and set them going outside in some dance
or other that they know?  I'm dog-tired, and I want to have a yew words with Mr. Everard before
we join 'em--hey, Everard? They are shy till somebody starts 'em; afterwards they'll keep gwine
brisk enough.'

'Ay, that they wool,' said Squire Everard.

They followed to the lawn; and here it proved that James Bellston was as shy, or rather as
averse, as any of the tenantry themselves, to acting the part of fugleman.  Only the parish
people had been at the feast, but outlying neighbours had now strolled in for a dance.

'They want "Speed the Plough,"' said Bellston, coming up breathless.  'It must be a country
dance, I suppose?  Now, Miss Everard, do have pity upon me.  I am supposed to lead off; but
really I know no more about speeding the plough than a child just born!  Would you take one
of the villagers?--just to start them, my uncle says.  Suppose you take that handsome young
farmer over there--I don't know his name, but I dare say you do--and I'll come on with one
of the dairyman's daughters as a second couple.'

Christine turned in the direction signified, and changed colour--though in the shade nobody
noticed it, 'Oh, yes--I know him,' she said coolly. 'He is from near our own place--Mr. Nicholas
Long.'

'That's capital--then you can easily make him stand as first couple with you.  Now I must pick
up mine.'

'I--I think I'll dance with you, Mr. Bellston,' she said with some trepidation.  'Because,
you see,' she explained eagerly, 'I know the figure and you don't--so that I can help you;
while Nicholas Long, I know, is familiar with the figure, and that will make two couples who
know it--which is necessary, at least.'

Bellston showed his gratification by one of his angry-pleasant flushes--he had hardly dared
to ask for what she proffered freely; and having requested Nicholas to take the dairyman's
daughter, led Christine to her place, Long promptly stepping up second with his charge.  There
were grim silent depths in Nic's character; a small deedy spark in his eye, as it caught Christine's,
was all that showed his consciousness of her.  Then the fiddlers began--the celebrated Mellstock
fiddlers who, given free stripping, could play from sunset to dawn without turning a hair.
The couples wheeled and swung, Nicholas taking Christine's hand in the course of business with
the figure, when she waited for him to give it a little squeeze; but he did not.

Christine had the greatest difficulty in steering her partner through the maze, on account
of his self-will, and when at last they reached the bottom of the long line, she was breathless
with her hard labour.. Resting here, she watched Nic and his lady; and, though she had decidedly
cooled off in these later months, began to admire him anew.  Nobody knew these dances like
him, after all, or could do anything of this sort so well.  His performance with the dairyman's
daughter so won upon her, that when 'Speed the Plough' was over she contrived to speak to him.

'Nic, you are to dance with me next time.'

He said he would, and presently asked her in a formal public manner, lifting his hat gallantly.
She showed a little backwardness, which he quite understood, and allowed him to lead her to
the top, a row of enormous length appearing below them as if by magic as soon as they had taken
their places.  Truly the Squire was right when he said that they only wanted starting.

'What is it to be?' whispered Nicholas.

She turned to the band.  'The Honeymoon,' she said.

And then they trod the delightful last-century measure of that name, which if it had been ever
danced better, was never danced with more zest. The perfect responsiveness which their tender
acquaintance threw into the motions of Nicholas and his partner lent to their gyrations the
fine adjustment of two interacting parts of a single machine.  The excitement of the movement
carried Christine back to the time--the unreflecting passionate time, about two years before--when
she and Nic had been incipient lovers only; and it made her forget the carking anxieties, the
vision of social breakers ahead, that had begun to take the gilding off her position now. 
Nicholas, on his part, had never ceased to be a lover; no personal worries had as yet made
him conscious of any staleness, flatness, or unprofitableness in his admiration of Christine.

'Not quite so wildly, Nic,' she whispered.  'I don't object personally; but they'll notice
us.  How came you here?'

'I heard that you had driven over; and I set out--on purpose for this.'

'What--you have walked?'

'Yes.  If I had waited for one of uncle's horses I should have been too late.'

'Five miles here and five back--ten miles on foot--merely to dance!'

'With you.  What made you think of this old "Honeymoon" thing?'

'O! it came into my head when I saw you, as what would have been a reality with us if you had
not been stupid about that licence, and had got it for a distant church.'

'Shall we try again?'

'No--I don't know.  I'll think it over.'

The villagers admired their grace and skill, as the dancers themselves perceived; but they
did not know what accompanied that admiration in one spot, at least.

'People who wonder they can foot it so featly together should know what some others think,'
a waterman was saying to his neighbour.  'Then their wonder would be less.'

His comrade asked for information.

'Well--really I hardly believe it--but 'tis said they be man and wife. Yes, sure--went to church
and did the job a'most afore 'twas light one morning.  But mind, not a word of this; for 'twould
be the loss of a winter's work to me if I had spread such a report and it were not true.'

When the dance had ended she rejoined her own section of the company.  Her father and Mr. Bellston
the elder had now come out from the house, and were smoking in the background.  Presently she
found that her father was at her elbow.

'Christine, don't dance too often with young Long--as a mere matter of prudence, I mean, as
volk might think it odd, he being one of our own neighbouring farmers.  I should not mention
this to 'ee if he were an ordinary young fellow; but being superior to the rest it behoves
you to be careful.'

'Exactly, papa,' said Christine.

But the revived sense that she was deceiving him threw a damp over her spirits.  'But, after
all,' she said to herself, 'he is a young man of Elsenford, handsome, able, and the soul of
honour; and I am a young woman of the adjoining parish, who have been constantly thrown into
communication with him.  Is it not, by nature's rule, the most proper thing in the world that
I should marry him, and is it not an absurd conventional regulation which says that such a
union would be wrong?'

It may be concluded that the strength of Christine's large-minded argument was rather an evidence
of weakness than of strength in the passion it concerned, which had required neither argument
nor reasoning of any kind for its maintenance when full and flush in its early days.

When driving home in the dark with her father she sank into pensive silence.  She was thinking
of Nicholas having to trudge on foot all those miles back after his exertions on the sward.
Mr. Everard, arousing himself from a nap, said suddenly, 'I have something to mention to 'ee,
by George--so I have, Chris!  You probably know what it is?'

She expressed ignorance, wondering if her father had discovered anything of her secret.

'Well, according to him you know it.  But I will tell 'ee.  Perhaps you noticed young Jim Bellston
walking me off down the lawn with him?--whether or no, we walked together a good while; and
he informed me that he wanted to pay his addresses to 'ee.  I naturally said that it depended
upon yourself; and he replied that you were willing enough; you had given him particular encouragement--showing
your preference for him by specially choosing him for your partner--hey?  "In that case," says
I, "go on and conquer--settle it with her--I have no objection."  The poor fellow was very
grateful, and in short, there we left the matter.  He'll propose to- morrow.'

She saw now to her dismay what James Bellston had read as encouragement. 'He has mistaken me
altogether,' she said.  'I had no idea of such a thing.'

'What, you won't have him?'

'Indeed, I cannot!'

'Chrissy,' said Mr. Everard with emphasis, 'there's noobody whom I should so like you to marry
as that young man.  He's a thoroughly clever fellow, and fairly well provided for.  He's travelled
all over the temperate zone; but he says that directly he marries he's going to give up all
that, and be a regular stay-at-home.  You would be nowhere safer than in his hands.'

'It is true,' she answered.  'He is a highly desirable match, and I should be well provided
for, and probably very safe in his hands.'

'Then don't be skittish, and stand-to.'

She had spoken from her conscience and understanding, and not to please her father.  As a reflecting
woman she believed that such a marriage would be a wise one.  In great things Nicholas was
closest to her nature; in little things Bellston seemed immeasurably nearer than Nic; and life
was made up of little things.

Altogether the firmament looked black for Nicholas Long, notwithstanding her half-hour's ardour
for him when she saw him dancing with the dairyman's daughter.  Most great passions, movements,
and beliefs--individual and national--burst during their decline into a temporary irradiation,
which rivals their original splendour; and then they speedily become extinct.  Perhaps the
dance had given the last flare- up to Christine's love.  It seemed to have improvidently consumed
for its immediate purpose all her ardour forwards, so that for the future there was nothing
left but frigidity.

Nicholas had certainly been very foolish about that licence!

CHAPTER IV

This laxity of emotional tone was further increased by an incident, when, two days later, she
kept an appointment with Nicholas in the Sallows.  The Sallows was an extension of shrubberies
and plantations along the banks of the Froom, accessible from the lawn of Froom-Everard House
only, except by wading through the river at the waterfall or elsewhere.  Near the brink was
a thicket of box in which a trunk lay prostrate; this had been once or twice their trysting-place,
though it was by no means a safe one; and it was here she sat awaiting him now.

The noise of the stream muffled any sound of footsteps, and it was before she was aware of
his approach that she looked up and saw him wading across at the top of the waterfall.

Noontide lights and dwarfed shadows always banished the romantic aspect of her love for Nicholas.
Moreover, something new had occurred to disturb her; and if ever she had regretted giving way
to a tenderness for him--which perhaps she had not done with any distinctness--she regretted
it now.  Yet in the bottom of their hearts those two were excellently paired, the very twin
halves of a perfect whole; and their love was pure. But at this hour surfaces showed garishly,
and obscured the depths. Probably her regret appeared in her face.

He walked up to her without speaking, the water running from his boots; and, taking one of
her hands in each of his own, looked narrowly into her eyes.

'Have you thought it over?'

'What?'

'Whether we shall try again; you remember saying you would at the dance?'

'Oh, I had forgotten that!'

'You are sorry we tried at all!' he said accusingly.

'I am not so sorry for the fact as for the rumours,' she said.

'Ah! rumours?'

'They say we are already married.'

'Who?'

'I cannot tell exactly.  I heard some whispering to that effect.  Somebody in the village told
one of the servants, I believe.  This man said that he was crossing the churchyard early on
that unfortunate foggy morning, and heard voices in the chancel, and peeped through the window
as well as the dim panes would let him; and there he saw you and me and Mr. Bealand, and so
on; but thinking his surmises would be dangerous knowledge, he hastened on.  And so the story
got afloat.  Then your aunt, too--'

'Good Lord!--what has she done?'

The story was, told her, and she said proudly, "O yes, it is true enough. I have seen the licence.
But it is not to be known yet."'

'Seen the licence?  How the--'

'Accidentally, I believe, when your coat was hanging somewhere.'

The information, coupled with the infelicitous word 'proudly,' caused Nicholas to flush with
mortification.  He knew that it was in his aunt's nature to make a brag of that sort; but worse
than the brag was the fact that this was the first occasion on which Christine had deigned
to show her consciousness that such a marriage would be a source of pride to his relatives--the
only two he had in the world.

'You are sorry, then, even to be thought my wife, much less to be it.'  He dropped her hand,
which fell lifelessly.

'It is not sorry exactly, dear Nic.  But I feel uncomfortable and vexed, that after screwing
up my courage, my fidelity, to the point of going to church, you should have so muddled--managed
the matter that it has ended in neither one thing nor the other.  How can I meet acquaintances,
when I don't know what they are thinking of me?'

'Then, dear Christine, let us mend the muddle.  I'll go away for a few days and get another
licence, and you can come to me.'

She shrank from this perceptibly.  'I cannot screw myself up to it a second time,' she said.
'I am sure I cannot!  Besides, I promised Mr. Bealand.  And yet how can I continue to see you
after such a rumour?  We shall be watched now, for certain.'

'Then don't see me.'

'I fear I must not for the present.  Altogether--'

'What?'

'I am very depressed.'

These views were not very inspiriting to Nicholas, as he construed them. It may indeed have
been possible that he construed them wrongly, and should have insisted upon her making the
rumour true.  Unfortunately, too, he had come to her in a hurry through brambles and briars,
water and weed, and the shaggy wildness which hung about his appearance at this fine and correct
time of day lent an impracticability to the look of him.

'You blame me--you repent your courses--you repent that you ever, ever owned anything to me!'

'No, Nicholas, I do not repent that,' she returned gently, though with firmness.  'But I think
that you ought not to have got that licence without asking me first; and I also think that
you ought to have known how it would be if you lived on here in your present position, and
made no effort to better it.  I can bear whatever comes, for social ruin is not personal ruin
or even personal disgrace.  Better wait.

As soon as you had got my promise, Nic, you should have gone away--yes--and made a name, and
come back to claim me.  That was my silly girlish dream about my hero.'

'Perhaps I can do as much yet!  And would you have indeed liked better to live away from me
for family reasons, than to run a risk in seeing me for affection's sake?  O what a cold heart
it has grown!  If I had been a prince, and you a dairymaid, I'd have stood by you in the face
of the world!'

She shook her head.  'Ah--you don't know what society is--you don't know.'

'Perhaps not.  Who was that strange gentleman of about seven-and-twenty I saw at Mr. Bellston's
christening feast?'

'Oh--that was his nephew James.  Now he is a man who has seen an unusual extent of the world
for his age.  He is a great traveller, you know.'

'Indeed.'

'In fact an explorer.  He is very entertaining.'

'No doubt.'

Nicholas received no shock of jealousy from her announcement.  He knew her so well that he
could see she was not in the least in love with Bellston.  But he asked if Bellston were going
to continue his explorations.

'Not if he settles in life.  Otherwise he will, I suppose.'

'Perhaps I could be a great explorer, too, if I tried.'

'You could, I am sure.'

They sat apart, and not together; each looking afar off at vague objects, and not in each other's
eyes.  Thus the sad autumn afternoon waned, while the waterfall hissed sarcastically of the
inevitableness of the unpleasant.  Very different this from the time when they had first met there.

The nook was most picturesque; but it looked horridly common and stupid now.  Their sentiment
had set a colour hardly less visible than a material one on surrounding objects, as sentiment
must where life is but thought.  Nicholas was as devoted as ever to the fair Christine; but
unhappily he too had moods and humours, and the division between them was not closed.

She had no sooner got indoors and sat down to her work-table than her father entered the drawing-room.

She handed him his newspaper; he took it without a word, went and stood on the hearthrug, and
flung the paper on the floor.

'Christine, what's the meaning of this terrible story?  I was just on my way to look at the
register.'

She looked at him without speech.

'You have married--Nicholas Long?'

'No, father.'

'No?  Can you say no in the face of such facts as I have been put in possession of?'

'Yes.'

'But--the note you wrote to the rector--and the going to church?'

She briefly explained that their attempt had failed.

'Ah!  Then this is what that dancing meant, was it?  By ---, it makes me ---.  How long has
this been going on, may I ask?'

'This what?'

'What, indeed!  Why, making him your beau.  Now listen to me.  All's well that ends well; from
this day, madam, this moment, he is to be nothing more to you.  You are not to see him.  Cut
him adrift instantly!  I only wish his volk were on my farm--out they should go, or I would
know the reason why.  However, you are to write him a letter to this effect at once.'

'How can I cut him adrift?'

'Why not?  You must, my good maid!'

'Well, though I have not actually married him, I have solemnly sworn to be his wife when he
comes home from abroad to claim me.  It would be gross perjury not to fulfil my promise.  Besides,
no woman can go to church with a man to deliberately solemnize matrimony, and refuse him afterwards,
if he does nothing wrong meanwhile.'

The uttered sound of her strong conviction seemed to kindle in Christine a livelier perception
of all its bearings than she had known while it had lain unformulated in her mind.  For when
she had done speaking she fell down on her knees before her father, covered her face, and said,
'Please, please forgive me, papa!  How could I do it without letting you know!  I don't know,
I don't know!'

When she looked up she found that, in the turmoil of his mind, her father was moving about
the room.  'You are within an ace of ruining yourself, ruining me, ruining us all!' he said.
'You are nearly as bad as your brother, begad!'

'Perhaps I am--yes--perhaps I am!'

'That I should father such a harum-scarum brood!'

'It is very bad; but Nicholas--'

'He's a scoundrel!'

'He is not a scoundrel!' cried she, turning quickly.  'He's as good and worthy as you or I,
or anybody bearing our name, or any nobleman in the kingdom, if you come to that!  Only--only'--she
could not continue the argument on those lines.  'Now, father, listen!' she sobbed; 'if you
taunt me I'll go off and join him at his farm this very day, and marry him to-morrow, that's
what I'll do!'

'I don't taant ye!'

'I wish to avoid unseemliness as much as you.'

She went away.  When she came back a quarter of an hour later, thinking to find the room empty,
he was standing there as before, never having apparently moved.  His manner had quite changed.
He seemed to take a resigned and entirely different view of circumstances.

'Christine, here's a paragraph in the paper hinting at a secret wedding, and I'm blazed if
it don't point to you.  Well, since this was to happen, I'll bear it, and not complain.  All
volk have crosses, and this is one of mine.  Now, this is what I've got to say--I feel that
you must carry out this attempt at marrying Nicholas Long.  Faith, you must!  The rumour will
become a scandal if you don't--that's my view.  I have tried to look at the brightest side
of the case.  Nicholas Long is a young man superior to most of his class, and fairly presentable.
And he's not poor--at least his uncle is not.  I believe the old muddler could buy me up any
day.  However, a farmer's wife you must be, as far as I can see.  As you've made your bed,
so ye must lie.  Parents propose, and ungrateful children dispose.  You shall marry him, and
immediately.'

Christine hardly knew what to make of this.  'He is quite willing to wait, and so am I.  We
can wait for two or three years, and then he will be as worthy as--'

'You must marry him.  And the sooner the better, if 'tis to be done at all . . . And yet I
did wish you could have been Jim Bellston's wife.  I did wish it!  But no.'

'I, too, wished it and do still, in one sense,' she returned gently.  His moderation had won
her out of her defiant mood, and she was willing to reason with him.

'You do?' he said surprised.

'I see that in a worldly sense my conduct with Mr. Long may be considered a mistake.'

'H'm--I am glad to hear that--after my death you may see it more clearly still; and you won't
have long to wait, to my reckoning.'

She fell into bitter repentance, and kissed him in her anguish.  'Don't say that!' she cried.
'Tell me what to do?'

'If you'll leave me for an hour or two I'll think.  Drive to the market and back--the carriage
is at the door--and I'll try to collect my senses. Dinner can be put back till you return.'

In a few minutes she was dressed, and the carriage bore her up the hill which divided the village
and manor from the market-town.

CHAPTER V

A quarter of an hour brought her into the High Street, and for want of a more important errand
she called at the harness-maker's for a dog-collar that she required.

It happened to be market-day, and Nicholas, having postponed the engagements which called him
thither to keep the appointment with her in the Sallows, rushed off at the end of the afternoon
to attend to them as well as he could.  Arriving thus in a great hurry on account of the lateness
of the hour, he still retained the wild, amphibious appearance which had marked him when he
came up from the meadows to her side--an exceptional condition of things which had scarcely
ever before occurred. When she crossed the pavement from the shop door, the shopman bowing
and escorting her to the carriage, Nicholas chanced to be standing at the road-waggon office,
talking to the master of the waggons.  There were a good many people about, and those near
paused and looked at her transit, in the full stroke of the level October sun, which went under
the brims of their hats, and pierced through their button-holes.  From the group she heard
murmured the words: 'Mrs. Nicholas Long.'

The unexpected remark, not without distinct satire in its tone, took her so greatly by surprise
that she was confounded.  Nicholas was by this time nearer, though coming against the sun he
had not yet perceived her. Influenced by her father's lecture, she felt angry with him for
being there and causing this awkwardness.  Her notice of him was therefore slight, supercilious
perhaps, slurred over; and her vexation at his presence showed distinctly in her face as she
sat down in her seat. Instead of catching his waiting eye, she positively turned her head away.

A moment after she was sorry she had treated him so; but he was gone.

Reaching home she found on her dressing-table a note from her father.  The statement was brief:

   I have considered and am of the same opinion.  You must marry him.  He
   can leave home at once and travel as proposed.  I have written to him
   to this effect.  I don't want any victuals, so don't wait dinner for
   me.

'What with getting the ham skinned, and the black-puddings hotted up,' she said, 'it will take
me all my time before he's here, if I begin this minute.'

'I'll lay the table myself,' said Christine, jumping up.  'Do you attend to the cooking.'

'Thank you, ma'am.  And perhaps 'tis no matter, seeing that it is the last night you'll have
to do such work.  I knew this sort of life wouldn't last long for 'ee, being born to better
things.'

'It has lasted rather long, Mrs. Wake.  And if he had not found me out it would have lasted
all my days.'

'But he did find you out.'

'He did.  And I'll lay the cloth immediately.'

Mrs. Wake went back to the kitchen, and Christine began to bustle about. She greatly enjoyed
preparing this table for Nicholas and herself with her own hands.  She took artistic pleasure
in adjusting each article to its position, as if half an inch error were a point of high importance.
Finally she placed the two candles where they were to stand, and sat down by the fire.

Mrs. Wake re-entered and regarded the effect.  'Why not have another candle or two, ma'am?'
she said.  ''Twould make it livelier.  Say four.'

'Very well,' said Christine, and four candles were lighted.  'Really,' she added, surveying
them, 'I have been now so long accustomed to little economies that they look quite extravagant.'

'Ah, you'll soon think nothing of forty in his grand new house!  Shall I bring in supper directly
he comes, ma'am?'

'No, not for half an hour; and, Mrs. Wake, you and Betsy are busy in the kitchen, I know; so
when he knocks don't disturb yourselves; I can let him in.'

She was again left alone, and, as it still wanted some time to Nicholas's appointment, she
stood by the fire, looking at herself in the glass over the mantel.  Reflectively raising a
lock of her hair just above her temple she uncovered a small scar.  That scar had a history.
The terrible temper of her late husband--those sudden moods of irascibility which had made
even his friendly excitements look like anger--had once caused him to set that mark upon her
with the bezel of a ring he wore.  He declared that the whole thing was an accident.  She was
a woman, and kept her own opinion.

Christine then turned her back to the glass and scanned the table and the candles, shining
one at each corner like types of the four Evangelists, and thought they looked too assuming--too
confident.  She glanced up at the clock, which stood also in this room, there not being space
enough for it in the passage.  It was nearly seven, and she expected Nicholas at half-past.
She liked the company of this venerable article in her lonely life: its tickings and whizzings
were a sort of conversation.  It now began to strike the hour.  At the end something grated
slightly.  Then, without any warning, the clock slowly inclined forward and fell at full length
upon the floor.

The crash brought the farmer's wife rushing into the room.  Christine had well-nigh sprung
out of her shoes.  Mrs. Wake's enquiry what had happened was answered by the evidence of her
own eyes.

'How did it occur?' she said.

'I cannot say; it was not firmly fixed, I suppose.  Dear me, how sorry I am!  My dear father's
hall-clock!  And now I suppose it is ruined.'

Assisted by Mrs. Wake, she lifted the clock.  Every inch of glass was, of course, shattered,
but very little harm besides appeared to be done.  They propped it up temporarily, though it
would not go again.

Christine had soon recovered her composure, but she saw that Mrs. Wake was gloomy.  'What does
it mean, Mrs. Wake?' she said.  'Is it ominous?'

'It is a sign of a violent death in the family.'

'Don't talk of it.  I don't believe such things; and don't mention it to Mr. Long when he comes.
He's not in the family yet, you know.'

'O no, it cannot refer to him,' said Mrs. Wake musingly.

'Some remote cousin, perhaps,' observed Christine, no less willing to humour her than to get
rid of a shapeless dread which the incident had caused in her own mind.  'And--supper is almost
ready, Mrs. Wake?'

'In three-quarters of an hour.'

Mrs. Wake left the room, and Christine sat on.  Though it still wanted fifteen minutes to the
hour at which Nicholas had promised to be there, she began to grow impatient.  After the accustomed
ticking the dead silence was oppressive.  But she had not to wait so long as she had expected;
steps were heard approaching the door, and there was a knock.

Christine was already there to open it.  The entrance had no lamp, but it was not particularly
dark out of doors.  She could see the outline of a man, and cried cheerfully, 'You are early;
it is very good of you.'

'I beg pardon.  It is not Mr. Bellston himself--only a messenger with his bag and great-coat.
But he will be here soon.'

The voice was not the voice of Nicholas, and the intelligence was strange.  'I--I don't understand.
Mr. Bellston?' she faintly replied.

'Yes, ma'am.  A gentleman--a stranger to me--gave me these things at Casterbridge station to
bring on here, and told me to say that Mr. Bellston had arrived there, and is detained for
half-an-hour, but will be here in the course of the evening.'

She sank into a chair.  The porter put a small battered portmanteau on the floor, the coat
on a chair, and looking into the room at the spread table said, 'If you are disappointed, ma'am,
that your husband (as I s'pose he is) is not come, I can assure you he'll soon be here.  He's
stopped to get a shave, to my thinking, seeing he wanted it.  What he said was that I could
tell you he had heard the news in Ireland, and would have come sooner, his hand being forced;
but was hindered crossing by the weather, having took passage in a sailing vessel.  What news
he meant he didn't say.'

'Ah, yes,' she faltered.  It was plain that the man knew nothing of her intended re-marriage.

Mechanically rising and giving him a shilling, she answered to his 'good- night,' and he withdrew,
the beat of his footsteps lessening in the distance.  She was alone; but in what a solitude.

Christine stood in the middle of the hall, just as the man had left her, in the gloomy silence
of the stopped clock within the adjoining room, till she aroused herself, and turning to the
portmanteau and great-coat brought them to the light of the candles, and examined them.  The
portmanteau bore painted upon it the initials 'J. B.' in white letters--the well-known initials
of her husband.

She examined the great-coat.  In the breast-pocket was an empty spirit flask, which she firmly
fancied she recognized as the one she had filled many times for him when he was living at home
with her.

She turned desultorily hither and thither, until she heard another tread without, and there
came a second knocking at the door.  She did not respond to it; and Nicholas--for it was he--thinking
that he was not heard by reason of a concentration on to-morrow's proceedings, opened the door
softly, and came on to the door of her room, which stood unclosed, just as it had been left
by the Casterbridge porter.

Nicholas uttered a blithe greeting, cast his eye round the parlour, which with its tall candles,
blazing fire, snow-white cloth, and prettily-spread table, formed a cheerful spectacle enough
for a man who had been walking in the dark for an hour.

'My bride--almost, at last!' he cried, encircling her with his arms.

Instead of responding, her figure became limp, frigid, heavy; her head fell back, and he found
that she had fainted.

It was natural, he thought.  She had had many little worrying matters to attend to, and but
slight assistance.  He ought to have seen more effectually to her affairs; the closeness of
the event had over-excited her.  Nicholas kissed her unconscious face--more than once, little
thinking what news it was that had changed its aspect.  Loth to call Mrs. Wake, he carried
Christine to a couch and laid her down.  This had the effect of reviving her.  Nicholas bent
and whispered in her ear, 'Lie quiet, dearest, no hurry; and dream, dream, dream of happy days.
It is only I.  You will soon be better.'  He held her by the hand.

'No, no, no!' she said, with a stare.  'O, how can this be?'

Nicholas was alarmed and perplexed, but the disclosure was not long delayed.  When she had
sat up, and by degrees made the stunning event known to him, he stood as if transfixed.

'Ah--is it so?' said he.  Then, becoming quite meek, 'And why was he so cruel as to--delay
his return till now?'

She dutifully recited the explanation her husband had given her through the messenger; but
her mechanical manner of telling it showed how much she doubted its truth.  It was too unlikely
that his arrival at such a dramatic moment should not be a contrived surprise, quite of a piece
with his previous dealings towards her.

'But perhaps it may be true--and he may have become kind now--not as he used to be,' she faltered.
'Yes, perhaps, Nicholas, he is an altered man--we'll hope he is.  I suppose I ought not to
have listened to my legal advisers, and assumed his death so surely!  Anyhow, I am roughly
received back into--the right way!'

Nicholas burst out bitterly: 'O what too, too honest fools we were!--to so court daylight upon
our intention by putting that announcement in the papers!  Why could we not have married privately,
and gone away, so that he would never have known what had become of you, even if he had returned?
Christine, he has done it to . . . But I'll say no more.  Of course we--might fly now.'

'No, no; we might not,' said she hastily.

'Very well.  But this is hard to bear!  So once said a sorely tried man in the land of Uz,
and so say I now! . . . I wonder if he is almost here at this moment?'

She told him she supposed Bellston was approaching by the path across the fields, having sent
on his great-coat, which he would not want walking.

'And is this meal laid for him, or for me?'

'It was laid for you.'

'And it will be eaten by him?'

'Yes.'

'Christine, are you sure that he is come, or have you been sleeping over the fire and dreaming it?'

She pointed anew to the portmanteau with the initials 'J. B.,' and to the coat beside it.

'Well, good-bye--good-bye!  Curse that parson for not marrying us fifteen years ago!'

It is unnecessary to dwell further upon that parting.  There are scenes wherein the words spoken
do not even approximate to the level of the mental communion between the actors.  Suffice it
to say that part they did, and quickly; and Nicholas, more dead than alive, went out of the
house homewards.

Why had he ever come back?  During his absence he had not cared for Christine as he cared now.
If he had been younger he might have felt tempted to descend into the meads instead of keeping
along their edge. The Froom was down there, and he knew of quiet pools in that stream to which
death would come easily.  But he was too old to put an end to himself for such a reason as
love; and another thought, too, kept him from seriously contemplating any desperate act.  His
affection for her was strongly protective, and in the event of her requiring a friend's support
in future troubles there was none but himself left in the world to afford it.  So he walked on.

Meanwhile Christine had resigned herself to circumstances.  A resolve to continue worthy of
her history and of her family lent her heroism and dignity.  She called Mrs. Wake, and explained
to that worthy woman as much of what had occurred as she deemed necessary.  Mrs. Wake was too
amazed to reply; she retreated slowly, her lips parted; till at the door she said with a dry
mouth, 'And the beautiful supper, ma'am?'

'Serve it when he comes.'

'When Mr. Bellston--yes, ma'am, I will.'  She still stood gazing, as if she could hardly take
in the order.

'That will do, Mrs. Wake.  I am much obliged to you for all your kindness.'  And Christine
was left alone again, and then she wept.

She sat down and waited.  That awful silence of the stopped clock began anew, but she did not
mind it now.  She was listening for a footfall in a state of mental tensity which almost took
away from her the power of motion.  It seemed to her that the natural interval for her husband's
journey thither must have expired; but she was not sure, and waited on.

Mrs. Wake again came in.  'You have not rung for supper--'

'He is not yet come, Mrs. Wake.  If you want to go to bed, bring in the supper and set it on
the table.  It will be nearly as good cold.  Leave the door unbarred.'

Mrs. Wake did as was suggested, made up the fire, and went away.  Shortly afterwards Christine
heard her retire to her chamber.  But Christine still sat on, and still her husband postponed
his entry.

She aroused herself once or twice to freshen the fire, but was ignorant how the night was going.
Her watch was upstairs and she did not make the effort to go up to consult it.  In her seat
she continued; and still the supper waited, and still he did not come.

At length she was so nearly persuaded that the arrival of his things must have been a dream
after all, that she again went over to them, felt them, and examined them.  His they unquestionably
were; and their forwarding by the porter had been quite natural.  She sighed and sat down again.

Presently she fell into a doze, and when she again became conscious she found that the four
candles had burnt into their sockets and gone out. The fire still emitted a feeble shine. 
Christine did not take the trouble to get more candles, but stirred the fire and sat on.

After a long period she heard a creaking of the chamber floor and stairs at the other end of
the house, and knew that the farmer's family were getting up.  By-and-by Mrs. Wake entered
the room, candle in hand, bouncing open the door in her morning manner, obviously without any
expectation of finding a person there.

'Lord-a-mercy!  What, sitting here again, ma'am?'

'Yes, I am sitting here still.'

'You've been there ever since last night?'

'Yes.'

'Then--'

'He's not come.'

'Well, he won't come at this time o' morning,' said the farmer's wife. 'Do 'ee get on to bed,
ma'am.  You must be shrammed to death!'

It occurred to Christine now that possibly her husband had thought better of obtruding himself
upon her company within an hour of revealing his existence to her, and had decided to pay a
more formal visit next day. She therefore adopted Mrs. Wake's suggestion and retired.

CHAPTER VIII

Nicholas had gone straight home, neither speaking to nor seeing a soul. From that hour a change
seemed to come over him.  He had ever possessed a full share of self-consciousness; he had
been readily piqued, had shown an unusual dread of being personally obtrusive.  But now his
sense of self, as an individual provoking opinion, appeared to leave him.  When, therefore,
after a day or two of seclusion, he came forth again, and the few acquaintances he had formed
in the town condoled with him on what had happened, and pitied his haggard looks, he did not
shrink from their regard as he would have done formerly, but took their sympathy as it would
have been accepted by a child.

It reached his ears that Bellston had not appeared on the evening of his arrival at any hotel
in the town or neighbourhood, or entered his wife's house at all.  'That's a part of his cruelty,'
thought Nicholas.  And when two or three days had passed, and still no account came to him
of Bellston having joined her, he ventured to set out for Froom-Everard.

Christine was so shaken that she was obliged to receive him as she lay on a sofa, beside the
square table which was to have borne their evening feast.  She fixed her eyes wistfully upon
him, and smiled a sad smile.

'He has not come?' said Nicholas under his breath.

'He has not.'

Then Nicholas sat beside her, and they talked on general topics merely like saddened old friends.
But they could not keep away the subject of Bellston, their voices dropping as it forced its
way in.  Christine, no less than Nicholas, knowing her husband's character, inferred that,
having stopped her game, as he would have phrased it, he was taking things leisurely, and,
finding nothing very attractive in her limited mode of living, was meaning to return to her
only when he had nothing better to do.

The bolt which laid low their hopes had struck so recently that they could hardly look each
other in the face when speaking that day.  But when a week or two had passed, and all the horizon
still remained as vacant of Bellston as before, Nicholas and she could talk of the event with
calm wonderment.  Why had he come, to go again like this?

And then there set in a period of resigned surmise, during which

   So like, so very like, was day to day,

that to tell of one of them is to tell of all.  Nicholas would arrive between three and four
in the afternoon, a faint trepidation influencing his walk as he neared her door.  He would
knock; she would always reply in person, having watched for him from the window.  Then he would
whisper--'He has not come?'

'He has not,' she would say.

Nicholas would enter then, and she being ready bonneted, they would walk into the Sallows together
as far as to the spot which they had frequently made their place of appointment in their youthful
days.  A plank bridge, which Bellston had caused to be thrown over the stream during his residence
with her in the manor-house, was now again removed, and all was just the same as in Nicholas's
time, when he had been accustomed to wade across on the edge of the cascade and come up to
her like a merman from the deep.  Here on the felled trunk, which still lay rotting in its
old place, they would now sit, gazing at the descending sheet of water, with its never-ending
sarcastic hiss at their baffled attempts to make themselves one flesh.  Returning to the house
they would sit down together to tea, after which, and the confidential chat that accompanied
it, he walked home by the declining light.  This proceeding became as periodic as an astronomical
recurrence.  Twice a week he came--all through that winter, all through the spring following,
through the summer, through the autumn, the next winter, the next year, and the next, till
an appreciable span of human life had passed by.  Bellston still tarried.

Years and years Nic walked that way, at this interval of three days, from his house in the
neighbouring town; and in every instance the aforesaid order of things was customary; and still
on his arrival the form of words went on--'He has not come?'

'He has not.'

So they grew older.  The dim shape of that third one stood continually between them; they could
not displace it; neither, on the other hand, could it effectually part them.  They were in
close communion, yet not indissolubly united; lovers, yet never growing cured of love.  By
the time that the fifth year of Nic's visiting had arrived, on about the five- hundredth occasion
of his presence at her tea-table, he noticed that the bleaching process which had begun upon
his own locks was also spreading to hers.  He told her so, and they laughed.  Yet she was in
good health: a condition of suspense, which would have half-killed a man, had been endured
by her without complaint, and even with composure.

One day, when these years of abeyance had numbered seven, they had strolled as usual as far
as the waterfall, whose faint roar formed a sort of calling voice sufficient in the circumstances
to direct their listlessness.  Pausing there, he looked up at her face and said, 'Why should
we not try again, Christine?  We are legally at liberty to do so now.  Nothing venture nothing
have.'

But she would not.  Perhaps a little primness of idea was by this time ousting the native daring
of Christine.  'What he has done once he can do twice,' she said.  'He is not dead, and if
we were to marry he would say we had "forced his hand," as he said before, and duly reappear.'

Some years after, when Christine was about fifty, and Nicholas fifty-three, a new trouble of
a minor kind arrived.  He found an inconvenience in traversing the distance between their two
houses, particularly in damp weather, the years he had spent in trying climates abroad having
sown the seeds of rheumatism, which made a journey undesirable on inclement days, even in a
carriage.  He told her of this new difficulty, as he did of everything.

'If you could live nearer,' suggested she.

Unluckily there was no house near.  But Nicholas, though not a millionaire, was a man of means;
he obtained a small piece of ground on lease at the nearest spot to her home that it could
be so obtained, which was on the opposite brink of the Froom, this river forming the boundary
of the Froom-Everard manor; and here he built a cottage large enough for his wants.  This took
time, and when he got into it he found its situation a great comfort to him.  He was not more
than five hundred yards from her now, and gained a new pleasure in feeling that all sounds
which greeted his ears, in the day or in the night, also fell upon hers--the caw of a particular
rook, the voice of a neighbouring nightingale, the whistle of a local breeze, or the purl of
the fall in the meadows, whose rush was a material rendering of Time's ceaseless scour over
themselves, wearing them away without uniting them.

Christine's missing husband was taking shape as a myth among the surrounding residents; but
he was still believed in as corporeally imminent by Christine herself, and also, in a milder
degree, by Nicholas. For a curious unconsciousness of the long lapse of time since his revelation
of himself seemed to affect the pair.  There had been no passing events to serve as chronological
milestones, and the evening on which she had kept supper waiting for him still loomed out with
startling nearness in their retrospects.

In the seventeenth pensive year of this their parallel march towards the common bourne, a labourer
came in a hurry one day to Nicholas's house and brought strange tidings.  The present owner
of Froom-Everard--a non-resident--had been improving his property in sundry ways, and one of
these was by dredging the stream which, in the course of years, had become choked with mud
and weeds in its passage through the Sallows.  The process necessitated a reconstruction of
the waterfall.  When the river had been pumped dry for this purpose, the skeleton of a man
had been found jammed among the piles supporting the edge of the fall.  Every particle of his
flesh and clothing had been eaten by fishes or abraded to nothing by the water, but the relics
of a gold watch remained, and on the inside of the case was engraved the name of the maker
of her husband's watch, which she well remembered.

Nicholas, deeply agitated, hastened down to the place and examined the remains attentively,
afterwards going across to Christine, and breaking the discovery to her.  She would not come
to view the skeleton, which lay extended on the grass, not a finger or toe-bone missing, so
neatly had the aquatic operators done their work.  Conjecture was directed to the question
how Bellston had got there; and conjecture alone could give an explanation.

It was supposed that, on his way to call upon her, he had taken a short cut through the grounds,
with which he was naturally very familiar, and coming to the fall under the trees had expected
to find there the plank which, during his occupancy of the premises with Christine and her
father, he had placed there for crossing into the meads on the other side instead of wading
across as Nicholas had done.  Before discovering its removal he had probably overbalanced himself,
and was thus precipitated into the cascade, the piles beneath the descending current wedging
him between them like the prongs of a pitchfork, and effectually preventing the rising of his
body, over which the weeds grew.  Such was the reasonable supposition concerning the discovery;
but proof was never forthcoming.

'To think,' said Nicholas, when the remains had been decently interred, and he was again sitting
with Christine--though not beside the waterfall--'to think how we visited him!  How we sat
over him, hours and hours, gazing at him, bewailing our fate, when all the time he was ironically
hissing at us from the spot, in an unknown tongue, that we could marry if we chose!'

She echoed the sentiment with a sigh.

'I have strange fancies,' she said.  'I suppose it must have been my husband who came back,
and not some other man.'

Nicholas felt that there was little doubt.  'Besides--the skeleton,' he said.

'Yes . . . If it could not have been another person's--but no, of course it was he.'

'You might have married me on the day we had fixed, and there would have been no impediment.
You would now have been seventeen years my wife, and we might have had tall sons and daughters.'

'It might have been so,' she murmured.

'Well--is it still better late than never?'

The question was one which had become complicated by the increasing years of each.  Their wills
were somewhat enfeebled now, their hearts sickened of tender enterprise by hope too long deferred.
Having postponed the consideration of their course till a year after the interment of Bellston,
each seemed less disposed than formerly to take it up again.

'Is it worth while, after so many years?' she said to him.  'We are fairly happy as we are--perhaps
happier than we should be in any other relation, seeing what old people we have grown.  The
weight is gone from our lives; the shadow no longer divides us: then let us be joyful together
as we are, dearest Nic, in the days of our vanity; and

   With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come.'

He fell in with these views of hers to some extent.  But occasionally he ventured to urge her
to reconsider the case, though he spoke not with the fervour of his earlier years.

Autumn, 1887.

ALICIA'S DIARY

CHAPTER I.--SHE MISSES HER SISTER

July 7.--I wander about the house in a mood of unutterable sadness, for my dear sister Caroline
has left home to-day with my mother, and I shall not see them again for several weeks.  They
have accepted a long-standing invitation to visit some old friends of ours, the Marlets, who
live at Versailles for cheapness--my mother thinking that it will be for the good of Caroline
to see a little of France and Paris.  But I don't quite like her going.  I fear she may lose
some of that childlike simplicity and gentleness which so characterize her, and have been nourished
by the seclusion of our life here.  Her solicitude about her pony before starting was quite
touching, and she made me promise to visit it daily, and see that it came to no harm.

Caroline gone abroad, and I left here!  It is the reverse of an ordinary situation, for good
or ill-luck has mostly ordained that I should be the absent one.  Mother will be quite tired
out by the young enthusiasm of Caroline.  She will demand to be taken everywhere--to Paris
continually, of course; to all the stock shrines of history's devotees; to palaces and prisons;
to kings' tombs and queens' tombs; to cemeteries and picture- galleries, and royal hunting
forests.  My poor mother, having gone over most of this ground many times before, will perhaps
not find the perambulation so exhilarating as will Caroline herself.  I wish I could have gone
with them.  I would not have minded having my legs walked off to please Caroline.  But this
regret is absurd: I could not, of course, leave my father with not a soul in the house to attend
to the calls of the parishioners or to pour out his tea.

July 15.--A letter from Caroline to-day.  It is very strange that she tells me nothing which
I expected her to tell--only trivial details.  She seems dazzled by the brilliancy of Paris--which
no doubt appears still more brilliant to her from the fact of her only being able to obtain
occasional glimpses of it.  She would see that Paris, too, has a seamy side if you live there.
I was not aware that the Marlets knew so many people.  If, as mother has said, they went to
reside at Versailles for reasons of economy, they will not effect much in that direction while
they make a practice of entertaining all the acquaintances who happen to be in their neighbourhood.
They do not confine their hospitalities to English people, either.  I wonder who this M. de
la Feste is, in whom Caroline says my mother is so much interested.

July 18.--Another letter from Caroline.  I have learnt from this epistle, that M. Charles de
la Feste is 'only one of the many friends of the Marlets'; that though a Frenchman by birth,
and now again temporarily at Versailles, he has lived in England many many years; that he is
a talented landscape and marine painter, and has exhibited at the Salon, and I think in London.
His style and subjects are considered somewhat peculiar in Paris--rather English than Continental.
I have not as yet learnt his age, or his condition, married or single.  From the tone and nature
of her remarks about him he sometimes seems to be a middle-aged family man, sometimes quite
the reverse.  From his nomadic habits I should say the latter is the most likely.  He has travelled
and seen a great deal, she tells me, and knows more about English literature than she knows
herself.

July 21.--Letter from Caroline.  Query: Is 'a friend of ours and the Marlets,' of whom she
now anonymously and mysteriously speaks, the same personage as the 'M. de la Feste' of her
former letters?  He must be the same, I think, from his pursuits.  If so, whence this sudden
change of tone? . . . I have been lost in thought for at least a quarter of an hour since writing
the preceding sentence.  Suppose my dear sister is falling in love with this young man--there
is no longer any doubt about his age; what a very awkward, risky thing for her!  I do hope
that my mother has an eye on these proceedings.  But, then, poor mother never sees the drift
of anything: she is in truth less of a mother to Caroline than I am.  If I were there, how
jealously I would watch him, and ascertain his designs!

I am of a stronger nature than Caroline.  How I have supported her in the past through her
little troubles and great griefs!  Is she agitated at the presence of this, to her, new and
strange feeling?  But I am assuming her to be desperately in love, when I have no proof of
anything of the kind.  He may be merely a casual friend, of whom I shall hear no more.

July 24.--Then he is a bachelor, as I suspected.  'If M. de la Feste ever marries he will,'
etc.  So she writes.  They are getting into close quarters, obviously.  Also, 'Something to
keep my hair smooth, which M. de la Feste told me he had found useful for the tips of his moustache.'
Very naively related this; and with how much unconsciousness of the intimacy between them that
the remark reveals!  But my mother--what can she be doing?  Does she know of this?  And if
so, why does she not allude to it in her letters to my father? . . . I have been to look at
Caroline's pony, in obedience to her reiterated request that I would not miss a day in seeing
that she was well cared for.  Anxious as Caroline was about this pony of hers before starting,
she now never mentioned the poor animal once in her letters.  The image of her pet suffers
from displacement.

August 3.--Caroline's forgetfulness of her pony has naturally enough extended to me, her sister.
It is ten days since she last wrote, and but for a note from my mother I should not know if
she were dead or alive.

CHAPTER II.--NEWS INTERESTING AND SERIOUS

August 5.--A cloud of letters.  A letter from Caroline, another from mother; also one from
each to my father.

The probability to which all the intelligence from my sister has pointed of late turns out
to be a fact.  There is an engagement, or almost an engagement, announced between my dear Caroline
and M. de la Feste--to Caroline's sublime happiness, and my mother's entire satisfaction; as
well as to that of the Marlets.  They and my mother seem to know all about the young man--which
is more than I do, though a little extended information about him, considering that I am Caroline's
elder sister, would not have been amiss.  I half feel with my father, who is much surprised,
and, I am sure, not altogether satisfied, that he should not have been consulted at all before
matters reached such a definite stage, though he is too amiable to say so openly.  I don't
quite say that a good thing should have been hindered for the sake of our opinion, if it is
a good thing; but the announcement comes very suddenly.  It must have been foreseen by my mother
for some time that this upshot was probable, and Caroline might have told me more distinctly
that M. de la Feste was her lover, instead of alluding so mysteriously to him as only a friend
of the Marlets, and lately dropping his name altogether.  My father, without exactly objecting
to him as a Frenchman, 'wishes he were of English or some other reasonable nationality for
one's son-in-law,' but I tell him that the demarcations of races, kingdoms, and creeds, are
wearing down every day, that patriotism is a sort of vice, and that the character of the individual
is all we need think about in this case.  I wonder if, in the event of their marriage, he will
continue to live at Versailles, or if he will come to England.

August 7.--A supplemental letter from Caroline, answering, by anticipation, some of the aforesaid
queries.  She tells me that 'Charles,' though he makes Versailles his present home, is by no
means bound by his profession to continue there; that he will live just where she wishes, provided
it be not too far from some centre of thought, art, and civilization.  My mother and herself
both think that the marriage should not take place till next year.  He exhibits landscapes
and canal scenery every year, she says; so I suppose he is popular, and that his income is
sufficient to keep them in comfort.  If not, I do not see why my father could not settle something
more on them than he had intended, and diminish by a little what he had proposed for me, whilst
it was imagined that I should be the first to stand in need of such.

'Of engaging manner, attractive appearance, and virtuous character,' is the reply I receive
from her in answer to my request for a personal description.  That is vague enough, and I would
rather have had one definite fact of complexion, voice, deed, or opinion.  But of course she
has no eye now for material qualities; she cannot see him as he is.  She sees him irradiated
with glories such as never appertained and never will appertain to any man, foreign, English,
or Colonial.  To think that Caroline, two years my junior, and so childlike as to be five years
my junior in nature, should be engaged to be married before me.  But that is what happens in
families more often than we are apt to remember.

August 16.--Interesting news to-day.  Charles, she says, has pleaded that their marriage may
just as well be this year as next; and he seems to have nearly converted my mother to the same
way of thinking.  I do not myself see any reason for delay, beyond the standing one of my father
having as yet had no opportunity of forming an opinion upon the man, the time, or anything.
However, he takes his lot very quietly, and they are coming home to talk the question over
with us; Caroline having decided not to make any positive arrangements for this change of state
till she has seen me.  Subject to my own and my father's approval, she says, they are inclined
to settle the date of the wedding for November, three months from the present time, that it
shall take place here in the village, that I, of course, shall be bridesmaid, and many other
particulars.  She draws an artless picture of the probable effect upon the minds of the villagers
of this romantic performance in the chancel of our old church, in which she is to be chief
actor--the foreign gentleman dropping down like a god from the skies, picking her up, and triumphantly
carrying her off.  Her only grief will be separation from me, but this is to be assuaged by
my going and staying with her for long months at a time.  This simple prattle is very sweet
to me, my dear sister, but I cannot help feeling sad at the occasion of it.  In the nature
of things it is obvious that I shall never be to you again what I hitherto have been: your
guide, counsellor, and most familiar friend.

M. de la Feste does certainly seem to be all that one could desire as protector to a sensitive
fragile child like Caroline, and for that I am thankful.  Still, I must remember that I see
him as yet only through her eyes.  For her sake I am intensely anxious to meet him, and scrutinise
him through and through, and learn what the man is really made of who is to have such a treasure
in his keeping.  The engagement has certainly been formed a little precipitately; I quite agree
with my father in that: still, good and happy marriages have been made in a hurry before now,
and mother seems well satisfied.

August 20.--A terrible announcement came this morning; and we are in deep trouble.  I have
been quite unable to steady my thoughts on anything to- day till now--half-past eleven at night--and
I only attempt writing these notes because I am too restless to remain idle, and there is nothing
but waiting and waiting left for me to do.  Mother has been taken dangerously ill at Versailles:
they were within a day or two of starting; but all thought of leaving must now be postponed,
for she cannot possibly be moved in her present state.  I don't like the sound of haemorrhage
at all in a woman of her full habit, and Caroline and the Marlets have not exaggerated their
accounts I am certain.  On the receipt of the letter my father instantly decided to go to her,
and I have been occupied all day in getting him off, for as he calculates on being absent several
days, there have been many matters for him to arrange before setting out--the chief being to
find some one who will do duty for him next Sunday--a quest of no small difficulty at such
short notice; but at last poor old feeble Mr. Dugdale has agreed to attempt it, with Mr. Highman,
the Scripture reader, to assist him in the lessons.

I fain would have gone with my father to escape the irksome anxiety of awaiting her; but somebody
had to stay, and I could best be spared. George has driven him to the station to meet the last
train by which he will catch the midnight boat, and reach Havre some time in the morning. He
hates the sea, and a night passage in particular.  I hope he will get there without mishap
of any kind; but I feel anxious for him, stay-at- home as he is, and unable to cope with any
difficulty.  Such an errand, too; the journey will be sad enough at best.  I almost think I
ought to have been the one to go to her.

August 21.--I nearly fell asleep of heaviness of spirit last night over my writing.  My father
must have reached Paris by this time; and now here comes a letter . . .

Later.--The letter was to express an earnest hope that my father had set out.  My poor mother
is sinking, they fear.  What will become of Caroline?  O, how I wish I could see mother; why
could not both have gone?

Later.--I get up from my chair, and walk from window to window, and then come and write a line.
I cannot even divine how poor Caroline's marriage is to be carried out if mother dies.  I pray
that father may have got there in time to talk to her and receive some directions from her
about Caroline and M. de la Feste--a man whom neither my father nor I have seen.  I, who might
be useful in this emergency, am doomed to stay here, waiting in suspense.

August 23.--A letter from my father containing the sad news that my mother's spirit has flown.
Poor little Caroline is heart-broken--she was always more my mother's pet than I was.  It is
some comfort to know that my father arrived in time to hear from her own lips her strongly
expressed wish that Caroline's marriage should be solemnized as soon as possible.  M. de la
Feste seems to have been a great favourite of my dear mother's; and I suppose it now becomes
almost a sacred duty of my father to accept him as a son-in-law without criticism.

CHAPTER III.--HER GLOOM LIGHTENS A LITTLE

September 10.--I have inserted nothing in my diary for more than a fortnight.  Events have
been altogether too sad for me to have the spirit to put them on paper.  And yet there comes
a time when the act of recording one's trouble is recognized as a welcome method of dwelling
upon it . . .

My dear mother has been brought home and buried here in the parish.  It was not so much her
own wish that this should be done as my father's, who particularly desired that she should
lie in the family vault beside his first wife.  I saw them side by side before the vault was
closed--two women beloved by one man.  As I stood, and Caroline by my side, I fell into a sort
of dream, and had an odd fancy that Caroline and I might be also beloved of one, and lie like
these together--an impossibility, of course, being sisters.  When I awoke from my reverie Caroline
took my hand and said it was time to leave.

September 14.--The wedding is indefinitely postponed.  Caroline is like a girl awakening in
the middle of a somnambulistic experience, and does not realize where she is, or how she stands.
She walks about silently, and I cannot tell her thoughts, as I used to do.  It was her own
doing to write to M. de la Feste and tell him that the wedding could not possibly take place
this autumn as originally planned.  There is something depressing in this long postponement
if she is to marry him at all; and yet I do not see how it could be avoided.

October 20.--I have had so much to occupy me in consoling Caroline that I have been continually
overlooking my diary.  Her life was much nearer to my mother's than mine was.  She has never,
as I, lived away from home long enough to become self-dependent, and hence in her first loss,
and all that it involved, she drooped like a rain-beaten lily.  But she is of a nature whose
wounds soon heal, even though they may be deep, and the supreme poignancy of her sorrow has
already passed.

My father is of opinion that the wedding should not be delayed too long. While at Versailles
he made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste, and though they had but a short and hurried communion
with each other, he was much impressed by M. de la Feste's disposition and conduct, and is
strongly in favour of his suit.  It is odd that Caroline's betrothed should influence in his
favour all who come near him.  His portrait, which dear Caroline has shown me, exhibits him
to be of a physique that partly accounts for this: but there must be something more than mere
appearance, and it is probably some sort of glamour or fascinating power--the quality which
prevented Caroline from describing him to me with any accuracy of detail.  At the same time,
I see from the photograph that his face and head are remarkably well formed; and though the
contours of his mouth are hidden by his moustache, his arched brows show well the romantic
disposition of a true lover and painter of Nature.  I think that the owner of such a face as
this must be tender and sympathetic and true.

October 30.--As my sister's grief for her mother becomes more and more calmed, her love for
M. de la Feste begins to reassume its former absorbing command of her.  She thinks of him incessantly,
and writes whole treatises to him by way of letters.  Her blank disappointment at his announcement
of his inability to pay us a visit quite so soon as he had promised, was quite tragic.  I,
too, am disappointed, for I wanted to see and estimate him.  But having arranged to go to Holland
to seize some aerial effects for his pictures, which are only to be obtained at this time of
the autumn, he is obliged to postpone his journey this way, which is now to be made early in
the new year.  I think myself that he ought to have come at all sacrifices, considering Caroline's
recent loss, the sad postponement of what she was looking forward to, and her single-minded
affection for him.  Still, who knows; his professional success is important.  Moreover, she
is cheerful, and hopeful, and the delay will soon be overpast.

CHAPTER IV.--SHE BEHOLDS THE ATTRACTIVE STRANGER

February 16.--We have had such a dull life here all the winter that I have found nothing important
enough to set down, and broke off my journal accordingly.  I resume it now to make an entry
on the subject of dear Caroline's future.  It seems that she was too grieved, immediately after
the loss of our mother, to answer definitely the question of M. de la Feste how long the postponement
was to be; then, afterwards, it was agreed that the matter should be discussed on his autumn
visit; but as he did not come, it has remained in abeyance till this week, when Caroline, with
the greatest simplicity and confidence, has written to him without any further pressure on
his part, and told him that she is quite ready to fix the time, and will do so as soon as he
arrives to see her.  She is a little frightened now, lest it should seem forward in her to
have revived the subject of her own accord; but she may assume that his question has been waiting
on for an answer ever since, and that she has, therefore, acted only within her promise.  In
truth, the secret at the bottom of it all is that she is somewhat saddened because he has not
latterly reminded her of the pause in their affairs--that, in short, his original impatience
to possess her is not now found to animate him so obviously.  I suppose that he loves her as
much as ever; indeed, I am sure he must do so, seeing how lovable she is.  It is mostly thus
with all men when women are out of their sight; they grow negligent.  Caroline must have patience,
and remember that a man of his genius has many and important calls upon his time.  In justice
to her I must add that she does remember it fairly well, and has as much patience as any girl
ever had in the circumstances.  He hopes to come at the beginning of April at latest. Well,
when he comes we shall see him.

April 5.--I think that what M. de la Feste writes is reasonable enough, though Caroline looks
heart-sick about it.  It is hardly worth while for him to cross all the way to England and
back just now, while the sea is so turbulent, seeing that he will be obliged, in any event,
to come in May, when he has to be in London for professional purposes, at which time he can
take us easily on his way both coming and going.  When Caroline becomes his wife she will be
more practical, no doubt; but she is such a child as yet that there is no contenting her with
reasons.  However, the time will pass quickly, there being so much to do in preparing a trousseau
for her, which must now be put in hand in order that we may have plenty of leisure to get it
ready.  On no account must Caroline be married in half-mourning; I am sure that mother, could
she know, would not wish it, and it is odd that Caroline should be so intractably persistent
on this point, when she is usually so yielding.

April 30.--This month has flown on swallow's wings.  We are in a great state of excitement--I
as much as she--I cannot quite tell why.  He is really coming in ten days, he says.

May 9.  Four p.m.--I am so agitated I can scarcely write, and yet am particularly impelled
to do so before leaving my room.  It is the unexpected shape of an expected event which has
caused my absurd excitement, which proves me almost as much a school-girl as Caroline.

M. de la Feste was not, as we understood, to have come till to-morrow; but he is here--just
arrived.  All household directions have devolved upon me, for my father, not thinking M. de
la Feste would appear before us for another four-and-twenty hours, left home before post time
to attend a distant consecration; and hence Caroline and I were in no small excitement when
Charles's letter was opened, and we read that he had been unexpectedly favoured in the dispatch
of his studio work, and would follow his letter in a few hours.  We sent the covered carriage
to meet the train indicated, and waited like two newly strung harps for the first sound of
the returning wheels.  At last we heard them on the gravel; and the question arose who was
to receive him.  It was, strictly speaking, my duty; but I felt timid; I could not help shirking
it, and insisted that Caroline should go down.  She did not, however, go near the door as she
usually does when anybody is expected, but waited palpitating in the drawing-room.  He little
thought when he saw the silent hall, and the apparently deserted house, how that house was
at the very same moment alive and throbbing with interest under the surface.  I stood at the
back of the upper landing, where nobody could see me from downstairs, and heard him walk across
the hall--a lighter step than my father's--and heard him then go into the drawing-room, and
the servant shut the door behind him and go away.

What a pretty lover's meeting they must have had in there all to themselves!  Caroline's sweet
face looking up from her black gown--how it must have touched him.  I know she wept very much,
for I heard her; and her eyes will be red afterwards, and no wonder, poor dear, though she
is no doubt happy.  I can imagine what she is telling him while I write this--her fears lest
anything should have happened to prevent his coming after all--gentle, smiling reproaches for
his long delay; and things of that sort.  His two portmanteaus are at this moment crossing
the landing on the way to his room.  I wonder if I ought to go down.

A little later.--I have seen him!  It was not at all in the way that I intended to encounter
him, and I am vexed.  Just after his portmanteaus were brought up I went out from my room to
descend, when, at the moment of stepping towards the first stair, my eyes were caught by an
object in the hall below, and I paused for an instant, till I saw that it was a bundle of canvas
and sticks, composing a sketching tent and easel.  At the same nick of time the drawing-room
door opened and the affianced pair came out.  They were saying they would go into the garden;
and he waited a moment while she put on her hat.  My idea was to let them pass on without seeing
me, since they seemed not to want my company, but I had got too far on the landing to retreat;
he looked up, and stood staring at me--engrossed to a dream-like fixity.  Thereupon I, too,
instead of advancing as I ought to have done, stood moonstruck and awkward, and before I could
gather my weak senses sufficiently to descend, she had called him, and they went out by the
garden door together.  I then thought of following them, but have changed my mind, and come
here to jot down these few lines.  It is all I am fit for . . .

He is even more handsome than I expected.  I was right in feeling he must have an attraction
beyond that of form: it appeared even in that momentary glance.  How happy Caroline ought to
be.  But I must, of course, go down to be ready with tea in the drawing-room by the time they
come indoors.

11 p.m.--I have made the acquaintance of M. de la Feste; and I seem to be another woman from
the effect of it.  I cannot describe why this should be so, but conversation with him seems
to expand the view, and open the heart, and raise one as upon stilts to wider prospects.  He
has a good intellectual forehead, perfect eyebrows, dark hair and eyes, an animated manner,
and a persuasive voice.  His voice is soft in quality--too soft for a man, perhaps; and yet
on second thoughts I would not have it less so.  We have been talking of his art: I had no
notion that art demanded such sacrifices or such tender devotion; or that there were two roads
for choice within its precincts, the road of vulgar money-making, and the road of high aims
and consequent inappreciation for many long years by the public.  That he has adopted the latter
need not be said to those who understand him.  It is a blessing for Caroline that she has been
chosen by such a man, and she ought not to lament at postponements and delays, since they have
arisen unavoidably.  Whether he finds hers a sufficiently rich nature, intellectually and emotionally,
for his own, I know not, but he seems occasionally to be disappointed at her simple views of
things. Does he really feel such love for her at this moment as he no doubt believes himself
to be feeling, and as he no doubt hopes to feel for the remainder of his life towards her?

It was a curious thing he told me when we were left for a few minutes alone; that Caroline
had alluded so slightly to me in her conversation and letters that he had not realized my presence
in the house here at all.  But, of course, it was only natural that she should write and talk
most about herself.  I suppose it was on account of the fact of his being taken in some measure
unawares, that I caught him on two or three occasions regarding me fixedly in a way that disquieted
me somewhat, having been lately in so little society; till my glance aroused him from his reverie,
and he looked elsewhere in some confusion.  It was fortunate that he did so, and thus failed
to notice my own.  It shows that he, too, is not particularly a society person.

May 10.--Have had another interesting conversation with M. de la Feste on schools of landscape
painting in the drawing-room after dinner this evening--my father having fallen asleep, and
left nobody but Caroline and myself for Charles to talk to.  I did not mean to say so much
to him, and had taken a volume of Modern Painters from the bookcase to occupy myself with,
while leaving the two lovers to themselves; but he would include me in his audience, and I
was obliged to lay the book aside.  However, I insisted on keeping Caroline in the conversation,
though her views on pictorial art were only too charmingly crude and primitive.

To-morrow, if fine, we are all three going to Wherryborne Wood, where Charles will give us
practical illustrations of the principles of coloring that he has enumerated to-night.  I am
determined not to occupy his attention to the exclusion of Caroline, and my plan is that when
we are in the dense part of the wood I will lag behind, and slip away, and leave them to return
by themselves.  I suppose the reason of his attentiveness to me lies in his simply wishing
to win the good opinion of one who is so closely united to Caroline, and so likely to influence
her good opinion of him.

May 11.  Late.--I cannot sleep, and in desperation have lit my candle and taken up my pen.
My restlessness is occasioned by what has occurred to- day, which at first I did not mean to
write down, or trust to any heart but my own.  We went to Wherryborne Wood--Caroline, Charles
and I, as we had intended--and walked all three along the green track through the midst, Charles
in the middle between Caroline and myself.  Presently I found that, as usual, he and I were
the only talkers, Caroline amusing herself by observing birds and squirrels as she walked docilely
alongside her betrothed.  Having noticed this I dropped behind at the first opportunity and
slipped among the trees, in a direction in which I knew I should find another path that would
take me home.  Upon this track I by and by emerged, and walked along it in silent thought till,
at a bend, I suddenly encountered M. de la Feste standing stock still and smiling thoughtfully
at me.

'Where is Caroline?' said I.

'Only a little way off,' says he.  'When we missed you from behind us we thought you might
have mistaken the direction we had followed, so she has gone one way to find you and I have
come this way.'

We then went back to find Caroline, but could not discover her anywhere, and the upshot was
that he and I were wandering about the woods alone for more than an hour.  On reaching home
we found she had given us up after searching a little while, and arrived there some time before.
I should not be so disturbed by the incident if I had not perceived that, during her absence
from us, he did not make any earnest effort to rediscover her; and in answer to my repeated
expressions of wonder as to whither she could have wandered he only said, 'Oh, she's quite
safe; she told me she knew the way home from any part of this wood.  Let us go on with our
talk.  I assure you I value this privilege of being with one I so much admire more than you
imagine;' and other things of that kind.  I was so foolish as to show a little perturbation--I
cannot tell why I did not control myself; and I think he noticed that I was not cool.  Caroline
has, with her simple good faith, thought nothing of the occurrence; yet altogether I am not
satisfied.

CHAPTER V.--HER SITUATION IS A TRYING ONE

May 15.--The more I think of it day after day, the more convinced I am that my suspicions are
true.  He is too interested in me--well, in plain words, loves me; or, not to degrade that
phrase, has a wild passion for me; and his affection for Caroline is that towards a sister
only.  That is the distressing truth; how it has come about I cannot tell, and it wears upon me.

A hundred little circumstances have revealed this to me, and the longer I dwell upon it the
more agitating does the consideration become.  Heaven only can help me out of the terrible
difficulty in which this places me. I have done nothing to encourage him to be faithless to
her.  I have studiously kept out of his way; have persistently refused to be a third in their
interviews.  Yet all to no purpose.  Some fatality has seemed to rule, ever since he came to
the house, that this disastrous inversion of things should arise.  If I had only foreseen the
possibility of it before he arrived, how gladly would I have departed on some visit or other
to the meanest friend to hinder such an apparent treachery.  But I blindly welcomed him--indeed,
made myself particularly agreeable to him for her sake.

There is no possibility of my suspicions being wrong; not until they have reached absolute
certainty have I dared even to admit the truth to myself.  His conduct to-day would have proved
them true had I entertained no previous apprehensions.  Some photographs of myself came for
me by post, and they were handed round at the breakfast table and criticised.  I put them temporarily
on a side table, and did not remember them until an hour afterwards when I was in my own room.
On going to fetch them I discovered him standing at the table with his back towards the door
bending over the photographs, one of which he raised to his lips.

The witnessing this act so frightened me that I crept away to escape observation.  It was the
climax to a series of slight and significant actions all tending to the same conclusion.  The
question for me now is, what am I to do?  To go away is what first occurs to me, but what reason
can I give Caroline and my father for such a step; besides, it might precipitate some sort
of catastrophe by driving Charles to desperation. For the present, therefore, I have decided
that I can only wait, though his contiguity is strangely disturbing to me now, and I hardly
retain strength of mind to encounter him.  How will the distressing complication end?

May 19.--And so it has come!  My mere avoidance of him has precipitated the worst issue--a
declaration.  I had occasion to go into the kitchen garden to gather some of the double ragged-robins
which grew in a corner there.  Almost as soon as I had entered I heard footsteps without. 
The door opened and shut, and I turned to behold him just inside it.  As the garden is closed
by four walls and the gardener was absent, the spot ensured absolute privacy.  He came along
the path by the asparagus-bed, and overtook me.

'You know why I come, Alicia?' said he, in a tremulous voice.

I said nothing, and hung my head, for by his tone I did know.

'Yes,' he went on, 'it is you I love; my sentiment towards your sister is one of affection
too, but protective, tutelary affection--no more.  Say what you will I cannot help it.  I mistook
my feeling for her, and I know how much I am to blame for my want of self-knowledge.  I have
fought against this discovery night and day; but it cannot be concealed.  Why did I ever see
you, since I could not see you till I had committed myself?  At the moment my eyes beheld you
on that day of my arrival, I said, "This is the woman for whom my manhood has waited."  Ever
since an unaccountable fascination has riveted my heart to you.  Answer one word!'

'O, M. de la Feste!' I burst out.  What I said more I cannot remember, but I suppose that the
misery I was in showed pretty plainly, for he said, 'Something must be done to let her know;
perhaps I have mistaken her affection, too; but all depends upon what you feel.'

'I cannot tell what I feel,' said I, 'except that this seems terrible treachery; and every
moment that I stay with you here makes it worse! .  . .  Try to keep faith with her--her young
heart is tender; believe me there is no mistake in the quality of her love for you.  Would
there were!  This would kill her if she knew it!'

He sighed heavily.  'She ought never to be my wife,' he said.  'Leaving my own happiness out
of the question, it would be a cruelty to her to unite her to me.'

I said I could not hear such words from him, and begged him in tears to go away; he obeyed,
and I heard the garden door shut behind him.  What is to be the end of the announcement, and
the fate of Caroline?

May 20.--I put a good deal on paper yesterday, and yet not all.  I was, in truth, hoping against
hope, against conviction, against too conscious self-judgment.  I scarcely dare own the truth
now, yet it relieves my aching heart to set it down.  Yes, I love him--that is the dreadful
fact, and I can no longer parry, evade, or deny it to myself though to the rest of the world
it can never be owned.  I love Caroline's betrothed, and he loves me.  It is no yesterday's
passion, cultivated by our converse; it came at first sight, independently of my will; and
my talk with him yesterday made rather against it than for it, but, alas, did not quench it.
God forgive us both for this terrible treachery.

May 25.--All is vague; our courses shapeless.  He comes and goes, being occupied, ostensibly
at least, with sketching in his tent in the wood. Whether he and she see each other privately
I cannot tell, but I rather think they do not; that she sadly awaits him, and he does not appear.
Not a sign from him that my repulse has done him any good, or that he will endeavour to keep
faith with her.  O, if I only had the compulsion of a god, and the self-sacrifice of a martyr!

May 31.--It has all ended--or rather this act of the sad drama has ended--in nothing.  He has
left us.  No day for the fulfilment of the engagement with Caroline is named, my father not
being the man to press any one on such a matter, or, indeed, to interfere in any way.  We two
girls are, in fact, quite defenceless in a case of this kind; lovers may come when they choose,
and desert when they choose; poor father is too urbane to utter a word of remonstrance or inquiry.
Moreover, as the approved of my dead mother, M. de la Feste has a sort of autocratic power
with my father, who holds it unkind to her memory to have an opinion about him.  I, feeling
it my duty, asked M. de la Feste at the last moment about the engagement, in a voice I could
not keep firm.

'Since the death of your mother all has been indefinite--all!' he said gloomily.  That was
the whole.  Possibly, Wherryborne Rectory may see him no more.

June 7 .--M. de la Feste has written--one letter to her, one to me.  Hers could not have been
very warm, for she did not brighten on reading it. Mine was an ordinary note of friendship,
filling an ordinary sheet of paper, which I handed over to Caroline when I had finished looking
it through.  But there was a scrap of paper in the bottom of the envelope, which I dared not
show any one.  This scrap is his real letter: I scanned it alone in my room, trembling, hot
and cold by turns.  He tells me he is very wretched; that he deplores what has happened, but
was helpless.  Why did I let him see me, if only to make him faithless.  Alas, alas!

June 21 .--My dear Caroline has lost appetite, spirits, health.  Hope deferred maketh the heart
sick.  His letters to her grow colder--if indeed he has written more than one.  He has refrained
from writing again to me--he knows it is no use.  Altogether the situation that he and she
and I are in is melancholy in the extreme.  Why are human hearts so perverse?

CHAPTER VI.--HER INGENUITY INSTIGATES HER

September 19.--Three months of anxious care--till at length I have taken the extreme step of
writing to him.  Our chief distress has been caused by the state of poor Caroline, who, after
sinking by degrees into such extreme weakness as to make it doubtful if she can ever recover
full vigour, has to-day been taken much worse.  Her position is very critical. The doctor says
plainly that she is dying of a broken heart--and that even the removal of the cause may not
now restore her.  Ought I to have written to Charles sooner?  But how could I when she forbade
me?  It was her pride only which instigated her, and I should not have obeyed.

Sept. 26.--Charles has arrived and has seen her.  He is shocked, conscience-stricken, remorseful.
I have told him that he can do no good beyond cheering her by his presence.  I do not know
what he thinks of proposing to her if she gets better, but he says little to her at present:
indeed he dares not: his words agitate her dangerously.

Sept. 28.--After a struggle between duty and selfishness, such as I pray to Heaven I may never
have to undergo again, I have asked him for pity's sake to make her his wife, here and now,
as she lies.  I said to him that the poor child would not trouble him long; and such a solemnization
would soothe her last hours as nothing else could do.  He said that he would willingly do so,
and had thought of it himself; but for one forbidding reason: in the event of her death as
his wife he can never marry me, her sister, according to our laws.  I started at his words.
He went on: 'On the other hand, if I were sure that immediate marriage with me would save her
life, I would not refuse, for possibly I might after a while, and out of sight of you, make
myself fairly content with one of so sweet a disposition as hers; but if, as is probable, neither
my marrying her nor any other act can avail to save her life, by so doing I lose both her and
you.'  I could not answer him.

Sept. 29.--He continued firm in his reasons for refusal till this morning, and then I became
possessed with an idea, which I at once propounded to him.  It was that he should at least
consent to a form of marriage with Caroline, in consideration of her love; a form which need
not be a legal union, but one which would satisfy her sick and enfeebled soul.  Such things
have been done, and the sentiment of feeling herself his would inexpressibly comfort her mind,
I am sure.  Then, if she is taken from us, I should not have lost the power of becoming his
lawful wife at some future day, if it indeed should be deemed expedient; if, on the other hand,
she lives, he can on her recovery inform her of the incompleteness of their marriage contract,
the ceremony can be repeated, and I can, and I am sure willingly would, avoid troubling them
with my presence till grey hairs and wrinkles make his unfortunate passion for me a thing of
the past.  I put all this before him; but he demurred.

Sept. 30.--I have urged him again.  He says he will consider.  It is no time to mince matters,
and as a further inducement I have offered to enter into a solemn engagement to marry him myself
a year after her death.

Sept. 30.  Later.--An agitating interview.  He says he will agree to whatever I propose, the
three possibilities and our contingent acts being recorded as follows: First, in the event
of dear Caroline being taken from us, I marry him on the expiration of a year: Second, in the
forlorn chance of her recovery I take upon myself the responsibility of explaining to Caroline
the true nature of the ceremony he has gone through with her, that it was done at my suggestion
to make her happy at once, before a special licence could be obtained, and that a public ceremony
at church is awaiting her: Third, in the unlikely event of her cooling, and refusing to repeat
the ceremony with him, I leave England, join him abroad, and there wed him, agreeing not to
live in England again till Caroline has either married another or regards her attachment to
Charles as a bygone matter.  I have thought over these conditions, and have agreed to them
all as they stand.

11 p.m.--I do not much like this scheme, after all.  For one thing, I have just sounded my
father on it before parting with him for the night, my impression having been that he would
see no objection.  But he says he could on no account countenance any such unreal proceeding;
however good our intentions, and even though the poor girl were dying, it would not be right.
So I sadly seek my pillow.

October 1.--I am sure my father is wrong in his view.  Why is it not right, if it would be
balm to Caroline's wounded soul, and if a real ceremony is absolutely refused by Charles--moreover
is hardly practicable in the difficulty of getting a special licence, if he were agreed?  My
father does not know, or will not believe, that Caroline's attachment has been the cause of
her hopeless condition.  But that it is so, and that the form of words would give her inexpressible
happiness, I know well; for I whispered tentatively in her ear on such marriages, and the effect
was great.  Henceforth my father cannot be taken into confidence on the subject of Caroline.
He does not understand her.

12 o'clock noon.--I have taken advantage of my father's absence to-day to confide my secret
notion to a thoughtful young man, who called here this morning to speak to my father.  He is
the Mr. Theophilus Higham, of whom I have already had occasion to speak--a Scripture reader
in the next town, and is soon going to be ordained.  I told him the pitiable case, and my remedy.
He says ardently that he will assist me--would do anything for me (he is, in truth, an admirer
of mine); he sees no wrong in such an act of charity.  He is coming again to the house this
afternoon before my father returns, to carry out the idea.  I have spoken to Charles, who promises
to be ready.  I must now break the news to Caroline.

11 o'clock p.m.--I have been in too much excitement till now to set down the result.  We have
accomplished our plan; and though I feel like a guilty sinner, I am glad.  My father, of course,
is not to be informed as yet.  Caroline has had a seraphic expression upon her wasted, transparent
face ever since.  I should hardly be surprised if it really saved her life even now, and rendered
a legitimate union necessary between them.  In that case my father can be informed of the whole
proceeding, and in the face of such wonderful success cannot disapprove.  Meanwhile poor Charles
has not lost the possibility of taking unworthy me to fill her place should she--.  But I cannot
contemplate that alternative unmoved, and will not write it.  Charles left for the South of
Europe immediately after the ceremony.  He was in a high-strung, throbbing, almost wild state
of mind at first, but grew calmer under my exhortations.  I had to pay the penalty of receiving
a farewell kiss from him, which I much regret, considering its meaning; but he took me so unexpectedly,
and in a moment was gone.

Oct. 6.--She certainly is better, and even when she found that Charles had been suddenly obliged
to leave, she received the news quite cheerfully.  The doctor says that her apparent improvement
may be delusive; but I think our impressing upon her the necessity of keeping what has occurred
a secret from papa, and everybody, helps to give her a zest for life.

Oct. 8.--She is still mending.  I am glad to have saved her--my only sister--if I have done
so; though I shall now never become Charles's wife.

CHAPTER VII.--A SURPRISE AWAITS HER

Feb. 5.--Writing has been absolutely impossible for a long while; but I now reach a stage at
which it seems possible to jot down a line. Caroline's recovery, extending over four months,
has been very engrossing; at first slow, latterly rapid.  But a fearful complication of affairs
attends it!

   O what a tangled web we weave
   When first we practise to deceive!

Charles has written reproachfully to me from Venice, where he is.  He says how can he fulfil
in the real what he has enacted in the counterfeit, while he still loves me?  Yet how, on the
other hand, can he leave it unfulfilled?  All this time I have not told her, and up to this
minute she believes that he has indeed taken her for better, for worse, till death them do
part.  It is a harassing position for me, and all three.  In the awful approach of death, one's
judgment loses its balance, and we do anything to meet the exigencies of the moment, with a
single eye to the one who excites our sympathy, and from whom we seem on the brink of being
separated for ever.

Had he really married her at that time all would be settled now.  But he took too much thought;
she might have died, and then he had his reason. If indeed it had turned out so, I should now
be perhaps a sad woman; but not a tempest-tossed one . . . The possibility of his claiming
me after all is what lies at the root of my agitation.  Everything hangs by a thread.  Suppose
I tell her the marriage was a mockery; suppose she is indignant with me and with him for the
deception--and then?  Otherwise, suppose she is not indignant but forgives all; he is bound
to marry her; and honour constrains me to urge him thereto, in spite of what he protests, and
to smooth the way to this issue by my method of informing her.  I have meant to tell her the
last month--ever since she has been strong enough to bear such tidings; but I have been without
the power--the moral force.  Surely I must write, and get him to come and assist me.

March 14.--She continually wonders why he does not come, the five months of his enforced absence
having expired; and still more she wonders why he does not write oftener.  His last letter
was cold, she says, and she fears he regrets his marriage, which he may only have celebrated
with her for pity's sake, thinking she was sure to die.  It makes one's heart bleed to hear
her hovering thus so near the truth, and yet never discerning its actual shape.

A minor trouble besets me, too, in the person of the young Scripture reader, whose conscience
pricks him for the part he played.  Surely I am punished, if ever woman were, for a too ingenious
perversion of her better judgment!

April 2.--She is practically well.  The faint pink revives in her cheek, though it is not quite
so full as heretofore.  But she still wonders what she can have done to offend 'her dear husband,'
and I have been obliged to tell the smallest part of the truth--an unimportant fragment of
the whole, in fact, I said that I feared for the moment he might regret the precipitancy of
the act, which her illness caused, his affairs not having been quite sufficiently advanced
for marriage just then, though he will doubtless come to her as soon as he has a home ready.
Meanwhile I have written to him, peremptorily, to come and relieve me in this awful dilemma.
He will find no note of love in that.

April 10.--To my alarm the letter I lately addressed to him at Venice, where he is staying,
as well as the last one she sent him, have received no reply.  She thinks he is ill.  I do
not quite think that, but I wish we could hear from him.  Perhaps the peremptoriness of my
words had offended him; it grieves me to think it possible.  I offend him!  But too much of
this.  I must tell her the truth, or she may in her ignorance commit herself to some course
or other that may be ruinously compromising.  She said plaintively just now that if he could
see her, and know how occupied with him and him alone is her every waking hour, she is sure
he would forgive her the wicked presumption of becoming his wife.  Very sweet all that, and
touching.  I could not conceal my tears.

April 15.--The house is in confusion; my father is angry and distressed, and I am distracted.
Caroline has disappeared--gone away secretly.  I cannot help thinking that I know where she
is gone to.  How guilty I seem, and how innocent she!  O that I had told her before now!

1 o'clock.--No trace of her as yet.  We find also that the little waiting- maid we have here
in training has disappeared with Caroline, and there is not much doubt that Caroline, fearing
to travel alone, has induced this girl to go with her as companion.  I am almost sure she has
started in desperation to find him, and that Venice is her goal.  Why should she run away,
if not to join her husband, as she thinks him?  Now that I consider, there have been indications
of this wish in her for days, as in birds of passage there lurk signs of their incipient intention;
and yet I did not think she would have taken such an extreme step, unaided, and without consulting
me.  I can only jot down the bare facts--I have no time for reflections.  But fancy Caroline
travelling across the continent of Europe with a chit of a girl, who will be more of a charge
than an assistance!  They will be a mark for every marauder who encounters them.

Evening: 8 o'clock.--Yes, it is as I surmised.  She has gone to join him. A note posted by
her in Budmouth Regis at daybreak has reached me this afternoon--thanks to the fortunate chance
of one of the servants calling for letters in town to-day, or I should not have got it until
to-morrow. She merely asserts her determination of going to him, and has started privately,
that nothing may hinder her; stating nothing about her route. That such a gentle thing should
suddenly become so calmly resolute quite surprises me.  Alas, he may have left Venice--she
may not find him for weeks--may not at all.

My father, on learning the facts, bade me at once have everything ready by nine this evening,
in time to drive to the train that meets the night steam-boat.  This I have done, and there
being an hour to spare before we start, I relieve the suspense of waiting by taking up my pen.
He says overtake her we must, and calls Charles the hardest of names.  He believes, of course,
that she is merely an infatuated girl rushing off to meet her lover; and how can the wretched
I tell him that she is more, and in a sense better than that--yet not sufficiently more and
better to make this flight to Charles anything but a still greater danger to her than a mere
lover's impulse.  We shall go by way of Paris, and we think we may overtake her there.  I hear
my father walking restlessly up and down the hall, and can write no more.

CHAPTER VIII.--SHE TRAVELS IN PURSUIT

April 16.  Evening, Paris, Hotel ---.--There is no overtaking her at this place; but she has
been here, as I thought, no other hotel in Paris being known to her.  We go on to-morrow morning.

April 18.  Venice.--A morning of adventures and emotions which leave me sick and weary, and
yet unable to sleep, though I have lain down on the sofa of my room for more than an hour in
the attempt.  I therefore make up my diary to date in a hurried fashion, for the sake of the
riddance it affords to ideas which otherwise remain suspended hotly in the brain.

We arrived here this morning in broad sunlight, which lit up the sea-girt buildings as we approached
so that they seemed like a city of cork floating raft-like on the smooth, blue deep.  But I
only glanced from the carriage window at the lovely scene, and we were soon across the intervening
water and inside the railway station.  When we got to the front steps the row of black gondolas
and the shouts of the gondoliers so bewildered my father that he was understood to require
two gondolas instead of one with two oars, and so I found him in one and myself in another.
We got this righted after a while, and were rowed at once to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni
where M. de la Feste had been staying when we last heard from him, the way being down the Grand
Canal for some distance, under the Rialto, and then by narrow canals which eventually brought
us under the Bridge of Sighs--harmonious to our moods!--and out again into open water.  The
scene was purity itself as to colour, but it was cruel that I should behold it for the first
time under such circumstances.

As soon as I entered the hotel, which is an old-fashioned place, like most places here, where
people are taken en pension as well as the ordinary way, I rushed to the framed list of visitors
hanging in the hall, and in a moment I saw Charles's name upon it among the rest.  But she
was our chief thought.  I turned to the hall porter, and--knowing that she would have travelled
as 'Madame de la Feste'--I asked for her under that name, without my father hearing.  (He,
poor soul, was making confused inquiries outside the door about 'an English lady,' as if there
were not a score of English ladies at hand.)

'She has just come,' said the porter.  'Madame came by the very early train this morning, when
Monsieur was asleep, and she requested us not to disturb him.  She is now in her room.'

Whether Caroline had seen us from the window, or overheard me, I do not know, but at that moment
I heard footsteps on the bare marble stairs, and she appeared in person descending.

'Caroline!' I exclaimed, 'why have you done this?' and rushed up to her.

She did not answer; but looked down to hide her emotion, which she conquered after the lapse
of a few seconds, putting on a practical tone that belied her.

'I am just going to my husband,' she said.  'I have not yet seen him.  I have not been here
long.'  She condescended to give no further reason for her movements, and made as if to move
on.  I implored her to come into a private room where I could speak to her in confidence, but
she objected. However, the dining-room, close at hand, was quite empty at this hour, and I
got her inside and closed the door.  I do not know how I began my explanation, or how I ended
it, but I told her briefly and brokenly enough that the marriage was not real.

'Not real?' she said vacantly.

'It is not,' said I.  'You will find that it is all as I say.'

She could not believe my meaning even then.  'Not his wife?' she cried. 'It is impossible.
What am I, then?'

I added more details, and reiterated the reason for my conduct as well as I could; but Heaven
knows how very difficult I found it to feel a jot more justification for it in my own mind
than she did in hers.

The revulsion of feeling, as soon as she really comprehended all, was most distressing.  After
her grief had in some measure spent itself she turned against both him and me.

'Why should have I been deceived like this?' she demanded, with a bitter haughtiness of which
I had not deemed such a tractable creature capable. 'Do you suppose that anything could justify
such an imposition?  What, O what a snare you have spread for me!'

I murmured, 'Your life seemed to require it,' but she did not hear me. She sank down in a chair,
covered her face, and then my father came in. 'O, here you are!' he said.  'I could not find
you.  And Caroline!'

'And were you, papa, a party to this strange deed of kindness?'

'To what?' said he.

Then out it all came, and for the first time he was made acquainted with the fact that the
scheme for soothing her illness, which I had sounded him upon, had been really carried out.
In a moment he sided with Caroline.  My repeated assurance that my motive was good availed
less than nothing.  In a minute or two Caroline arose and went abruptly out of the room, and
my father followed her, leaving me alone to my reflections.

I was so bent upon finding Charles immediately that I did not notice whither they went.  The
servants told me that M. de la Feste was just outside smoking, and one of them went to look
for him, I following; but before we had gone many steps he came out of the hotel behind me.
I expected him to be amazed; but he showed no surprise at seeing me, though he showed another
kind of feeling to an extent which dismayed me.  I may have revealed something similar; but
I struggled hard against all emotion, and as soon as I could I told him she had come.  He simply
said 'Yes' in a low voice.

'You know it, Charles?' said I.

'I have just learnt it,' he said.

'O, Charles,' I went on, 'having delayed completing your marriage with her till now, I fear--it
has become a serious position for us.  Why did you not reply to our letters?'

'I was purposing to reply in person: I did not know how to address her on the point--how to
address you.  But what has become of her?'

'She has gone off with my father,' said I; 'indignant with you, and scorning me.'

He was silent: and I suggested that we should follow them, pointing out the direction which
I fancied their gondola had taken.  As the one we got into was doubly manned we soon came in
view of their two figures ahead of us, while they were not likely to observe us, our boat having
the 'felze' on, while theirs was uncovered.  They shot into a narrow canal just beyond the
Giardino Reale, and by the time we were floating up between its slimy walls we saw them getting
out of their gondola at the steps which lead up near the end of the Via 22 Marzo.  When we
reached the same spot they were walking up and down the Via in consultation.  Getting out he
stood on the lower steps watching them.  I watched him.  He seemed to fall into a reverie.

'Will you not go and speak to her?' said I at length.

He assented, and went forward.  Still he did not hasten to join them, but, screened by a projecting
window, observed their musing converse.  At last he looked back at me; whereupon I pointed
forward, and he in obedience stepped out, and met them face to face.  Caroline flushed hot,
bowed haughtily to him, turned away, and taking my father's arm violently, led him off before
he had had time to use his own judgment. They disappeared into a narrow calle, or alley, leading
to the back of the buildings on the Grand Canal.

M. de la Feste came slowly back; as he stepped in beside me I realized my position so vividly
that my heart might almost have been heard to beat. The third condition had arisen--the least
expected by either of us.  She had refused him; he was free to claim me.

We returned in the boat together.  He seemed quite absorbed till we had turned the angle into
the Grand Canal, when he broke the silence.  'She spoke very bitterly to you in the salle-a-manger,'
he said.  'I do not think she was quite warranted in speaking so to you, who had nursed her
so tenderly.'

'O, but I think she was,' I answered.  'It was there I told her what had been done; she did
not know till then.'

'She was very dignified--very striking,' he murmured.  'You were more.'

'But how do you know what passed between us,' said I.  He then told me that he had seen and
heard all.  The dining-room was divided by folding- doors from an inner portion, and he had
been sitting in the latter part when we entered the outer, so that our words were distinctly
audible.

'But, dear Alicia,' he went on, 'I was more impressed by the affection of your apology to her
than by anything else.  And do you know that now the conditions have arisen which give me liberty
to consider you my affianced?'  I had been expecting this, but yet was not prepared.  I stammered
out that we would not discuss it then.

'Why not?' said he.  'Do you know that we may marry here and now?  She has cast off both you
and me.'

'It cannot be,' said I, firmly.  'She has not been fairly asked to be your wife in fact--to
repeat the service lawfully; and until that has been done it would be grievous sin in me to
accept you.'

I had not noticed where the gondoliers were rowing us.  I suppose he had given them some direction
unheard by me, for as I resigned myself in despairing indolence to the motion of the gondola,
I perceived that it was taking us up the Canal, and, turning into a side opening near the Palazzo
Grimani, drew up at some steps near the end of a large church.

'Where are we?' said I.

'It is the Church of the Frari,' he replied.  'We might be married there. At any rate, let
us go inside, and grow calm, and decide what to do.'

When we had entered I found that whether a place to marry in or not, it was one to depress.
The word which Venice speaks most constantly--decay--was in a sense accentuated here.  The
whole large fabric itself seemed sinking into an earth which was not solid enough to bear it.
Cobwebbed cracks zigzagged the walls, and similar webs clouded the window-panes.  A sickly-sweet
smell pervaded the aisles.  After walking about with him a little while in embarrassing silences,
divided only by his cursory explanations of the monuments and other objects, and almost fearing
he might produce a marriage licence, I went to a door in the south transept which opened into
the sacristy.

I glanced through it, towards the small altar at the upper end.  The place was empty save of
one figure; and she was kneeling here in front of the beautiful altarpiece by Bellini.  Beautiful
though it was she seemed not to see it.  She was weeping and praying as though her heart was
broken.  She was my sister Caroline.  I beckoned to Charles, and he came to my side, and looked
through the door with me.

'Speak to her,' said I.  'She will forgive you.'

I gently pushed him through the doorway, and went back into the transept, down the nave, and
onward to the west door.  There I saw my father, to whom I spoke.  He answered severely that,
having first obtained comfortable quarters in a pension on the Grand Canal, he had gone back
to the hotel on the Riva degli Schiavoni to find me; but that I was not there.  He was now
waiting for Caroline, to accompany her back to the pension, at which she had requested to be
left to herself as much as possible till she could regain some composure.

I told him that it was useless to dwell on what was past, that I no doubt had erred, that the
remedy lay in the future and their marriage.  In this he quite agreed with me, and on my informing
him that M. de la Feste was at that moment with Caroline in the sacristy, he assented to my
proposal that we should leave them to themselves, and return together to await them at the
pension, where he had also engaged a room for me.  This we did, and going up to the chamber
he had chosen for me, which overlooked the Canal, I leant from the window to watch for the
gondola that should contain Charles and my sister.

They were not long in coming.  I recognized them by the colour of her sunshade as soon as they
turned the bend on my right hand.  They were side by side of necessity, but there was no conversation
between them, and I thought that she looked flushed and he pale.  When they were rowed in to
the steps of our house he handed her up.  I fancied she might have refused his assistance,
but she did not.  Soon I heard her pass my door, and wishing to know the result of their interview
I went downstairs, seeing that the gondola had not put off with him.  He was turning from the
door, but not towards the water, intending apparently to walk home by way of the calle which
led into the Via 22 Marzo.

'Has she forgiven you?' said I.

'I have not asked her,' he said.

'But you are bound to do so,' I told him.

He paused, and then said, 'Alicia, let us understand each other.  Do you mean to tell me, once
for all, that if your sister is willing to become my wife you absolutely make way for her,
and will not entertain any thought of what I suggested to you any more?'

'I do tell you so,' said I with dry lips.  'You belong to her--how can I do otherwise?'

'Yes; it is so; it is purely a question of honour,' he returned.  'Very well then, honour shall
be my word, and not my love.  I will put the question to her frankly; if she says yes, the
marriage shall be.  But not here.  It shall be at your own house in England.'

'When?' said I.

'I will accompany her there,' he replied, 'and it shall be within a week of her return.  I
have nothing to gain by delay.  But I will not answer for the consequences.'

'What do you mean?' said I.  He made no reply, went away, and I came back to my room.

CHAPTER IX.--SHE WITNESSES THE END

April 20.  Milan, 10.30 p.m.--We are thus far on our way homeward.  I, being decidedly de trop,
travel apart from the rest as much as I can. Having dined at the hotel here, I went out by
myself; regardless of the proprieties, for I could not stay in.  I walked at a leisurely pace
along the Via Allesandro Manzoni till my eye was caught by the grand Galleria Vittorio Emanuele,
and I entered under the high glass arcades till I reached the central octagon, where I sat
down on one of a group of chairs placed there.  Becoming accustomed to the stream of promenaders,
I soon observed, seated on the chairs opposite, Caroline and Charles.  This was the first occasion
on which I had seen them en tete-a-tete since my conversation with him.  She soon caught sight
of me; averted her eyes; then, apparently abandoning herself to an impulse, she jumped up from
her seat and came across to me.  We had not spoken to each other since the meeting in Venice.

'Alicia,' she said, sitting down by my side, 'Charles asks me to forgive you, and I do forgive
you.'

I pressed her hand, with tears in my eyes, and said, 'And do you forgive him?'

'Yes,' said she, shyly.

'And what's the result?' said I.

'We are to be married directly we reach home.'

This was almost the whole of our conversation; she walked home with me, Charles following a
little way behind, though she kept turning her head, as if anxious that he should overtake
us.  'Honour and not love' seemed to ring in my ears.  So matters stand.  Caroline is again happy.

April 25.--We have reached home, Charles with us.  Events are now moving in silent speed, almost
with velocity, indeed; and I sometimes feel oppressed by the strange and preternatural ease
which seems to accompany their flow.  Charles is staying at the neighbouring town; he is only
waiting for the marriage licence; when obtained he is to come here, be quietly married to her,
and carry her off.  It is rather resignation than content which sits on his face; but he has
not spoken a word more to me on the burning subject, or deviated one hair's breadth from the
course he laid down.  They may be happy in time to come: I hope so.  But I cannot shake off
depression.

May 6.--Eve of the wedding.  Caroline is serenely happy, though not blithe.  But there is nothing
to excite anxiety about her.  I wish I could say the same of him.  He comes and goes like a
ghost, and yet nobody seems to observe this strangeness in his mien.

I could not help being here for the ceremony; but my absence would have resulted in less disquiet
on his part, I believe.  However, I may be wrong in attributing causes: my father simply says
that Charles and Caroline have as good a chance of being happy as other people.  Well, to-
morrow settles all.

May 7.--They are married: we have just returned from church. As talk such disagreeable similes being theoretical
to her, son where it thought, meads aim to be the post, who may, who is there for entry, me see unlike
Charles'proper station. She ought be done of needless, without full:

S ought go just will suppose in effort was marked to half. Reader, for sidlinch, should know from
dry, safety; from making where it is admit, nor what might lose me would.
  'Yes, there's
war in Spain; and another chance for me to be worthy of father.'

So the matter ended that night.  That the private acted in one thing as he had vowed to do
soon became apparent, for during the Christmas week the rector came into the churchyard when
Cattstock was there, and asked him to find a spot that would be suitable for the purpose of
such an interment, adding that he had slightly known the late sergeant, and was not aware of
any law which forbade him to assent to the removal, the letter of the rule having been observed.
But as he did not wish to seem moved by opposition to his neighbour at Sidlinch, he had stipulated
that the act of charity should be carried out at night, and as privately as possible, and that
the grave should be in an obscure part of the enclosure.  'You had better see the young man
about it at once,' added the rector.

But before Ezra had done anything Luke came down to his house.  His furlough had been cut short,
owing to new developments of the war in the Peninsula, and being obliged to go back to his
regiment immediately, he was compelled to leave the exhumation and reinterment to his friends.
Everything was paid for, and he implored them all to see it carried out forthwith.

With this the soldier left.  The next day Ezra, on thinking the matter over, again went across
to the rectory, struck with sudden misgiving.  He had remembered that the sergeant had been
buried without a coffin, and he was not sure that a stake had not been driven through him.
The business would be more troublesome than they had at first supposed.

'Yes, indeed!' murmured the rector.  'I am afraid it is not feasible after all.'

The next event was the arrival of a headstone by carrier from the nearest town; to be left
at Mr. Ezra Cattstock's; all expenses paid.  The sexton and the carrier deposited the stone
in the former's outhouse; and Ezra, left alone, put on his spectacles and read the brief and
simple inscription:-

   HERE LYETH THE BODY OF SAMUEL HOLWAY, LATE SERGEANT IN HIS MAJESTY'S
   ---D REGIMENT OF FOOT, WHO DEPARTED THIS LIFE DECEMBER THE 20TH, 180-.
   ERECTED BY L. H.
   'I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED THY SON.'

Ezra again called at the riverside rectory.  'The stone is come, sir.  But I'm afeard we can't
do it nohow.'

'I should like to oblige him,' said the gentlemanly old incumbent.  'And I would forego all
fees willingly.  Still, if you and the others don't think you can carry it out, I am in doubt
what to say.'

Well, sir; I've made inquiry of a Sidlinch woman as to his burial, and what I thought seems
true.  They buried en wi' a new six-foot hurdle-saul drough's body, from the sheep-pen up in
North Ewelease though they won't own to it now.  And the question is, Is the moving worth while,
considering the awkwardness?'

'Have you heard anything more of the young man?'

Ezra had only heard that he had embarked that week for Spain with the rest of the regiment.
'And if he's as desperate as 'a seemed, we shall never see him here in England again.'

'It is an awkward case,' said the rector.

Ezra talked it over with the choir; one of whom suggested that the stone might be erected at
the crossroads.  This was regarded as impracticable. Another said that it might be set up in
the churchyard without removing the body; but this was seen to be dishonest.  So nothing was done.

The headstone remained in Ezra's outhouse till, growing tired of seeing it there, he put it
away among the bushes at the bottom of his garden. The subject was sometimes revived among
them, but it always ended with: 'Considering how 'a was buried, we can hardly make a job o't.'

There was always the consciousness that Luke would never come back, an impression strengthened
by the disasters which were rumoured to have befallen the army in Spain.  This tended to make
their inertness permanent.  The headstone grew green as it lay on its back under Ezra's bushes;
then a tree by the river was blown down, and, falling across the stone, cracked it in three
pieces.  Ultimately the pieces became buried in the leaves and mould.

Luke had not been born a Chalk-Newton man, and he had no relations left in Sidlinch, so that
no tidings of him reached either village throughout the war.  But after Waterloo and the fall
of Napoleon there arrived at Sidlinch one day an English sergeant-major covered with stripes
and, as it turned out, rich in glory.  Foreign service had so totally changed Luke Holway that
it was not until he told his name that the inhabitants recognized him as the sergeant's only son.

He had served with unswerving effectiveness through the Peninsular campaigns under Wellington;
had fought at Busaco, Fuentes d'Onore, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Salamanca, Vittoria, Quatre
Bras, and Waterloo; and had now returned to enjoy a more than earned pension and repose in
his native district.

He hardly stayed in Sidlinch longer than to take a meal on his arrival. The same evening he
started on foot over the hill to Chalk-Newton, passing the hand-post, and saying as he glanced
at the spot, 'Thank God: he's not there!'  Nightfall was approaching when he reached the latter
village; but he made straight for the churchyard.  On his entering it there remained light
enough to discern the headstones by, and these he narrowly scanned.  But though he searched
the front part by the road, and the back part by the river, what he sought he could not find--the
grave of Sergeant Holway, and a memorial bearing the inscription: 'I AM NOT WORTHY TO BE CALLED
THY SON.'

He left the churchyard and made inquiries.  The honourable and reverend old rector was dead,
and so were many of the choir; but by degrees the sergeant-major learnt that his father still
lay at the cross-roads in Long Ash Lane.

Luke pursued his way moodily homewards, to do which, in the natural course, he would be compelled
to repass the spot, there being no other road between the two villages.  But he could not now
go by that place, vociferous with reproaches in his father's tones; and he got over the hedge
and wandered deviously through the ploughed fields to avoid the scene.  Through many a fight
and fatigue Luke had been sustained by the thought that he was restoring the family honour
and making noble amends. Yet his father lay still in degradation.  It was rather a sentiment
than a fact that his father's body had been made to suffer for his own misdeeds; but to his
super-sensitiveness it seemed that his efforts to retrieve his character and to propitiate
the shade of the insulted one had ended in failure.

He endeavoured, however, to shake off his lethargy, and, not liking the associations of Sidlinch,
hired a small cottage at Chalk-Newton which had long been empty.  Here he lived alone, becoming
quite a hermit, and allowing no woman to enter the house.

The Christmas after taking up his abode herein he was sitting in the chimney corner by himself,
when he heard faint notes in the distance, and soon a melody burst forth immediately outside
his own window, it came from the carol-singers, as usual; and though many of the old hands,
Ezra and Lot included, had gone to their rest, the same old carols were still played out of
the same old books.

When they had finished they went on to another house, leaving him to silence and loneliness
as before.

The candle wanted snuffing, but he did not snuff it, and he sat on till it had burnt down into
the socket and made waves of shadow on the ceiling.

The Christmas cheerfulness of next morning was broken at breakfast-time by tragic intelligence
which went down the village like wind.  Sergeant- Major Holway had been found shot through
the head by his own hand at the cross-roads in Long Ash Lane where his father lay buried.

On the table in the cottage he had left a piece of paper, on which he had written his wish
that he might be buried at the Cross beside his father. But the paper was accidentally swept
to the floor, and overlooked till after his funeral, which took place in the ordinary way in
the churchyard.

Christmas 1897.

ENTER A DRAGOON

I lately had a melancholy experience (said the gentleman who is answerable for the truth of
this story).  It was that of going over a doomed house with whose outside aspect I had long
been familiar--a house, that is, which by reason of age and dilapidation was to be pulled down
during the following week.  Some of the thatch, brown and rotten as the gills of old mushrooms,
had, indeed, been removed before I walked over the building.  Seeing that it was only a very
small house--which is usually called a 'cottage-residence'--situated in a remote hamlet, and
that it was not more than a hundred years old, if so much, I was led to think in my progress
through the hollow rooms, with their cracked walls and sloping floors, what an exceptional
number of abrupt family incidents had taken place therein--to reckon only those which had come
to my own knowledge.  And no doubt there were many more of which I had never heard.

It stood at the top of a garden stretching down to the lane or street that ran through a hermit-group
of dwellings in Mellstock parish.  From a green gate at the lower entrance, over which the
thorn hedge had been shaped to an arch by constant clippings, a gravel path ascended between
the box edges of once trim raspberry, strawberry, and vegetable plots, towards the front door.
This was in colour an ancient and bleached green that could be rubbed off with the finger,
and it bore a small long-featured brass knocker covered with verdigris in its crevices.  For
some years before this eve of demolition the homestead had degenerated, and been divided into
two tenements to serve as cottages for farm labourers; but in its prime it had indisputable
claim to be considered neat, pretty, and genteel.

The variety of incidents above alluded to was mainly owing to the nature of the tenure, whereby
the place had been occupied by families not quite of the kind customary in such spots--people
whose circumstances, position, or antecedents were more or less of a critical happy-go-lucky
cast.  And of these residents the family whose term comprised the story I wish to relate was
that of Mr. Jacob Paddock the market-gardener, who dwelt there for some years with his wife
and grown-up daughter.

I

An evident commotion was agitating the premises, which jerked busy sounds across the front
plot, resembling those of a disturbed hive.  If a member of the household appeared at the door
it was with a countenance of abstraction and concern.

Evening began to bend over the scene; and the other inhabitants of the hamlet came out to draw
water, their common well being in the public road opposite the garden and house of the Paddocks.
Having wound up their bucketsfull respectively they lingered, and spoke significantly together.
From their words any casual listener might have gathered information of what had occurred.

The woodman who lived nearest the site of the story told most of the tale.  Selina, the daughter
of the Paddocks opposite, had been surprised that afternoon by receiving a letter from her
once intended husband, then a corporal, but now a sergeant-major of dragoons, whom she had
hitherto supposed to be one of the slain in the Battle of the Alma two or three years before.

'She picked up wi'en against her father's wish, as we know, and before he got his stripes,'
their informant continued.  'Not but that the man was as hearty a feller as you'd meet this
side o' London.  But Jacob, you see, wished her to do better, and one can understand it.  However,
she was determined to stick to him at that time; and for what happened she was not much to
blame, so near as they were to matrimony when the war broke out and spoiled all.'

'Even the very pig had been killed for the wedding,' said a woman, 'and the barrel o' beer
ordered in.  O, the man meant honourable enough.  But to be off in two days to fight in a foreign
country--'twas natural of her father to say they should wait till he got back.'

'And he never came,' murmured one in the shade.

'The war ended but her man never turned up again.  She was not sure he was killed, but was
too proud, or too timid, to go and hunt for him.'

'One reason why her father forgave her when he found out how matters stood was, as he said
plain at the time, that he liked the man, and could see that he meant to act straight.  So
the old folks made the best of what they couldn't mend, and kept her there with 'em, when some
wouldn't. Time has proved seemingly that he did mean to act straight, now that he has writ
to her that he's coming.  She'd have stuck to him all through the time, 'tis my belief; if
t'other hadn't come along.'

'At the time of the courtship,' resumed the woodman, 'the regiment was quartered in Casterbridge
Barracks, and he and she got acquainted by his calling to buy a penn'orth of rathe-ripes off
that tree yonder in her father's orchard--though 'twas said he seed her over hedge as well
as the apples.  He declared 'twas a kind of apple he much fancied; and he called for a penn'orth
every day till the tree was cleared.  It ended in his calling for her.'

''Twas a thousand pities they didn't jine up at once and ha' done wi' it.

'Well; better late than never, if so be he'll have her now.  But, Lord, she'd that faith in
'en that she'd no more belief that he was alive, when a' didn't come, than that the undermost
man in our churchyard was alive. She'd never have thought of another but for that--O no!'

''Tis awkward, altogether, for her now.'

'Still she hadn't married wi' the new man.  Though to be sure she would have committed it next
week, even the licence being got, they say, for she'd have no banns this time, the first being
so unfortunate.'

'Perhaps the sergeant-major will think he's released, and go as he came.'

'O, not as I reckon.  Soldiers bain't particular, and she's a tidy piece o' furniture still.
What will happen is that she'll have her soldier, and break off with the master-wheelwright,
licence or no--daze me if she won't.'

In the progress of these desultory conjectures the form of another neighbour arose in the gloom.
She nodded to the people at the well, who replied 'G'd night, Mrs. Stone,' as she passed through
Mr. Paddock's gate towards his door.  She was an intimate friend of the latter's household,
and the group followed her with their eyes up the path and past the windows, which were now
lighted up by candles inside.

II

Mrs. Stone paused at the door, knocked, and was admitted by Selina's mother, who took her visitor
at once into the parlour on the left hand, where a table was partly spread for supper.  On
the 'beaufet' against the wall stood probably the only object which would have attracted the
eye of a local stranger in an otherwise ordinarily furnished room, a great plum- cake guarded
as if it were a curiosity by a glass shade of the kind seen in museums--square, with a wooden
back like those enclosing stuffed specimens of rare feather or fur.  This was the mummy of
the cake intended in earlier days for the wedding-feast of Selina and the soldier, which had
been religiously and lovingly preserved by the former as a testimony to her intentional respectability
in spite of an untoward subsequent circumstance, which will be mentioned.  This relic was now
as dry as a brick, and seemed to belong to a pre-existent civilization.  Till quite recently,
Selina had been in the habit of pausing before it daily, and recalling the accident whose consequences
had thrown a shadow over her life ever since--that of which the water-drawers had spoken--the
sudden news one morning that the Route had come for the ---th Dragoons, two days only being
the interval before departure; the hurried consultation as to what should be done, the second
time of asking being past but not the third; and the decision that it would be unwise to solemnize
matrimony in such haphazard circumstances, even if it were possible, which was doubtful.

Before the fire the young woman in question was now seated on a low stool, in the stillness
of reverie, and a toddling boy played about the floor around her.

'Ah, Mrs. Stone!' said Selina, rising slowly.  'How kind of you to come in.  You'll bide to
supper?  Mother has told you the strange news, of course?'

'No.  But I heard it outside, that is, that you'd had a letter from Mr. Clark--Sergeant-Major
Clark, as they say he is now--and that he's coming to make it up with 'ee.'

'Yes; coming to-night--all the way from the north of England where he's quartered.  I don't
know whether I'm happy or--frightened at it.  Of course I always believed that if he was alive
he'd come and keep his solemn vow to me.  But when it is printed that a man is killed--what
can you think?'

'It was printed?'

'Why, yes.  After the Battle of the Alma the book of the names of the killed and wounded was
nailed up against Casterbridge Town Hall door. 'Twas on a Saturday, and I walked there o' purpose
to read and see for myself; for I'd heard that his name was down.  There was a crowd of people
round the book, looking for the names of relations; and I can mind that when they saw me they
made way for me--knowing that we'd been just going to be married--and that, as you may say,
I belonged to him.  Well, I reached up my arm, and turned over the farrels of the book, and
under the "killed" I read his surname, but instead of "John" they'd printed "James," and I
thought 'twas a mistake, and that it must be he.  Who could have guessed there were two nearly
of one name in one regiment.'

'Well--he's coming to finish the wedding of 'ee as may be said; so never mind, my dear.  All's
well that ends well.'

'That's what he seems to say.  But then he has not heard yet about Mr. Miller; and that's what
rather terrifies me.  Luckily my marriage with him next week was to have been by licence, and
not banns, as in John's case; and it was not so well known on that account.  Still, I don't
know what to think.'

'Everything seems to come just 'twixt cup and lip with 'ee, don't it now, Miss Paddock.  Two
weddings broke off--'tis odd!  How came you to accept Mr. Miller, my dear?'

'He's been so good and faithful!  Not minding about the child at all; for he knew the rights
of the story.  He's dearly fond o' Johnny, you know--just as if 'twere his own--isn't he, my
duck?  Do Mr. Miller love you or don't he?'

'Iss!  An' I love Mr. Miller,' said the toddler.

'Well, you see, Mrs. Stone, he said he'd make me a comfortable home; and thinking 'twould be
a good thing for Johnny, Mr. Miller being so much better off than me, I agreed at last, just
as a widow might--which is what I have always felt myself; ever since I saw what I thought
was John's name printed there.  I hope John will forgive me!'

'So he will forgive 'ee, since 'twas no manner of wrong to him.  He ought to have sent 'ee
a line, saying 'twas another man.'

Selina's mother entered.  'We've not known of this an hour, Mrs. Stone,' she said.  'The letter
was brought up from Lower Mellstock Post-office by one of the school children, only this afternoon.
Mr. Miller was coming here this very night to settle about the wedding doings.  Hark!  Is that
your father?  Or is it Mr. Miller already come?'

The footsteps entered the porch; there was a brushing on the mat, and the door of the room
sprung back to disclose a rubicund man about thirty years of age, of thriving master-mechanic
appearance and obviously comfortable temper.  On seeing the child, and before taking any notice
whatever of the elders, the comer made a noise like the crowing of a cock and flapped his arms
as if they were wings, a method of entry which had the unqualified admiration of Johnny.

'Yes--it is he,' said Selina constrainedly advancing.

'What--were you all talking about me, my dear?' said the genial young man when he had finished
his crowing and resumed human manners.  'Why what's the matter,' he went on.  'You look struck
all of a heap.'  Mr. Miller spread an aspect of concern over his own face, and drew a chair
up to the fire.

'O mother, would you tell Mr. Miller, if he don't know?'

'Mister Miller! and going to be married in six days!' he interposed.

'Ah--he don't know it yet!' murmured Mrs. Paddock.

'Know what?'

'Well--John Clark--now Sergeant-Major Clark--wasn't shot at Alma after all.  'Twas another
of almost the same name.'

'Now that's interesting!  There were several cases like that.'

'And he's home again; and he's coming here to-night to see her.'

'Whatever shall I say, that he may not be offended with what I've done?' interposed Selina.

'But why should it matter if he be?'

'O!  I must agree to be his wife if he forgives me--of course I must.'

'Must!  But why not say nay, Selina, even if he do forgive 'ee?'

'O no!  How can I without being wicked?  You were very very kind, Mr. Miller, to ask me to
have you; no other man would have done it after what had happened; and I agreed, even though
I did not feel half so warm as I ought.  Yet it was entirely owing to my believing him in the
grave, as I knew that if he were not he would carry out his promise; and this shows that I
was right in trusting him.'

'Yes . . . He must be a goodish sort of fellow,' said Mr. Miller, for a moment so impressed
with the excellently faithful conduct of the sergeant- major of dragoons that he disregarded
its effect upon his own position. He sighed slowly and added, 'Well, Selina, 'tis for you to
say.  I love you, and I love the boy; and there's my chimney-corner and sticks o' furniture
ready for 'ee both.'

'Yes, I know!  But I mustn't hear it any more now,' murmured Selina quickly.  'John will be
here soon.  I hope he'll see how it all was when I tell him.  If so be I could have written
it to him it would have been better.'

'You think he doesn't know a single word about our having been on the brink o't.  But perhaps
it's the other way--he's heard of it and that may have brought him.

'Ah--perhaps he has!' she said brightening.  'And already forgives me.'

'If not, speak out straight and fair, and tell him exactly how it fell out.  If he's a man
he'll see it.'

'O he's a man true enough.  But I really do think I shan't have to tell him at all, since you've
put it to me that way!'

As it was now Johnny's bedtime he was carried upstairs, and when Selina came down again her
mother observed with some anxiety, 'I fancy Mr. Clark must be here soon if he's coming; and
that being so, perhaps Mr. Miller wouldn't mind--wishing us good-night! since you are so determined
to stick to your sergeant-major.'  A little bitterness bubbled amid the closing words.  'It
would be less awkward, Mr. Miller not being here--if he will allow me to say it.'

'To be sure; to be sure,' the master-wheelwright exclaimed with instant conviction, rising
alertly from his chair.  'Lord bless my soul,' he said, taking up his hat and stick, 'and we
to have been married in six days!  But Selina--you're right.  You do belong to the child's
father since he's alive.  I'll try to make the best of it.'

Before the generous Miller had got further there came a knock to the door accompanied by the
noise of wheels.

'I thought I heard something driving up!' said Mrs Paddock.

They heard Mr. Paddock, who had been smoking in the room opposite, rise and go to the door,
and in a moment a voice familiar enough to Selina was audibly saying, 'At last I am here again--not
without many interruptions! How is it with 'ee, Mr. Paddock?  And how is she?  Thought never
to see me again, I suppose?'

A step with a clink of spurs in it struck upon the entry floor.

'Danged if I bain't catched!' murmured Mr. Miller, forgetting company- speech.  'Never mind--I
may as well meet him here as elsewhere; and I should like to see the chap, and make friends
with en, as he seems one o' the right sort.'  He returned to the fireplace just as the sergeant-major
was ushered in.

III

He was a good specimen of the long-service soldier of those days; a not unhandsome man, with
a certain undemonstrative dignity, which some might have said to be partly owing to the stiffness
of his uniform about his neck, the high stock being still worn.  He was much stouter than when
Selina had parted from him.  Although she had not meant to be demonstrative she ran across
to him directly she saw him, and he held her in his arms and kissed her.

Then in much agitation she whispered something to him, at which he seemed to be much surprised.

'He's just put to bed,' she continued.  'You can go up and see him.  I knew you'd come if you
were alive!  But I had quite gi'd you up for dead. You've been home in England ever since the
war ended?'

'Yes, dear.'

'Why didn't you come sooner?'

'That's just what I ask myself!  Why was I such a sappy as not to hurry here the first day
I set foot on shore!  Well, who'd have thought it--you are as pretty as ever!'

He relinquished her to peep upstairs a little way, where, by looking through the ballusters,
he could see Johnny's cot just within an open door.  On his stepping down again Mr. Miller
was preparing to depart.

'Now, what's this?  I am sorry to see anybody going the moment I've come,' expostulated the
sergeant-major.  'I thought we might make an evening of it.  There's a nine gallon cask o'
"Phoenix" beer outside in the trap, and a ham, and half a rawmil' cheese; for I thought you
might be short o' forage in a lonely place like this; and it struck me we might like to ask
in a neighbour or two.  But perhaps it would be taking a liberty?'

'O no, not at all,' said Mr. Paddock, who was now in the room, in a judicial measured manner.
'Very thoughtful of 'ee, only 'twas not necessary, for we had just laid in an extry stock of
eatables and drinkables in preparation for the coming event.'

''Twas very kind, upon my heart,' said the soldier, 'to think me worth such a jocund preparation,
since you could only have got my letter this morning.'

Selina gazed at her father to stop him, and exchanged embarrassed glances with Miller.  Contrary
to her hopes Sergeant-Major Clark plainly did not know that the preparations referred to were
for something quite other than his own visit.

The movement of the horse outside, and the impatient tapping of a whip- handle upon the vehicle
reminded them that Clark's driver was still in waiting.  The provisions were brought into the
house, and the cart dismissed.  Miller, with very little pressure indeed, accepted an invitation
to supper, and a few neighbours were induced to come in to make up a cheerful party.

During the laying of the meal, and throughout its continuance, Selina, who sat beside her first
intended husband, tried frequently to break the news to him of her engagement to the other--now
terminated so suddenly, and so happily for her heart, and her sense of womanly virtue.  But
the talk ran entirely upon the late war; and though fortified by half a horn of the strong
ale brought by the sergeant-major she decided that she might have a better opportunity when
supper was over of revealing the situation to him in private.

Having supped, Clark leaned back at ease in his chair and looked around. 'We used sometimes
to have a dance in that other room after supper, Selina dear, I recollect.  We used to clear
out all the furniture into this room before beginning.  Have you kept up such goings on?'

'No, not at all!' said his sweetheart, sadly.

'We were not unlikely to revive it in a few days,' said Mr. Paddock. 'But, howsomever, there's
seemingly many a slip, as the saying is.'

'Yes, I'll tell John all about that by and by!' interposed Selina; at which, perceiving that
the secret which he did not like keeping was to be kept even yet, her father held his tongue
with some show of testiness.

The subject of a dance having been broached, to put the thought in practice was the feeling
of all.  Soon after the tables and chairs were borne from the opposite room to this by zealous
hands, and two of the villagers sent home for a fiddle and tambourine, when the majority began
to tread a measure well known in that secluded vale.  Selina naturally danced with the sergeant-major,
not altogether to her father's satisfaction, and to the real uneasiness of her mother, both
of whom would have preferred a postponement of festivities till the rashly anticipated relationship
between their daughter and Clark in the past had been made fact by the church's ordinances.
They did not, however, express a positive objection, Mr. Paddock remembering, with self-reproach,
that it was owing to his original strongly expressed disapproval of Selina's being a soldier's
wife that the wedding had been delayed, and finally hindered--with worse consequences than
were expected; and ever since the misadventure brought about by his government he had allowed
events to steer their own courses.

'My tails will surely catch in your spurs, John!' murmured the daughter of the house, as she
whirled around upon his arm with the rapt soul and look of a somnambulist.  'I didn't know
we should dance, or I would have put on my other frock.'

'I'll take care, my love.  We've danced here before.  Do you think your father objects to me
now?  I've risen in rank.  I fancy he's still a little against me.'

'He has repented, times enough.'

'And so have I!  If I had married you then 'twould have saved many a misfortune.  I have sometimes
thought it might have been possible to rush the ceremony through somehow before I left; though
we were only in the second asking, were we?  And even if I had come back straight here when
we returned from the Crimea, and married you then, how much happier I should have been!'

'Dear John, to say that!  Why didn't you?'

'O--dilatoriness and want of thought, and a fear of facing your father after so long.  I was
in hospital a great while, you know.  But how familiar the place seems again!  What's that
I saw on the beaufet in the other room?  It never used to be there.  A sort of withered corpse
of a cake--not an old bride-cake surely?'

'Yes, John, ours.  'Tis the very one that was made for our wedding three years ago.'

'Sakes alive!  Why, time shuts up together, and all between then and now seems not to have
been!  What became of that wedding-gown that they were making in this room, I remember--a bluish,
whitish, frothy thing?'

'I have that too.'

'Really! . . . Why, Selina--'

'Yes!'

'Why not put it on now?'

'Wouldn't it seem--.  And yet, O how I should like to!  It would remind them all, if we told
them what it was, how we really meant to be married on that bygone day!'  Her eyes were again
laden with wet.

'Yes . . . The pity that we didn't--the pity!'  Moody mournfulness seemed to hold silent awhile
one not naturally taciturn.  'Well--will you?' he said.

'I will--the next dance, if mother don't mind.'

Accordingly, just before the next figure was formed, Selina disappeared, and speedily came
downstairs in a creased and box-worn, but still airy and pretty, muslin gown, which was indeed
the very one that had been meant to grace her as a bride three years before.

'It is dreadfully old-fashioned,' she apologized.

'Not at all.  What a grand thought of mine!  Now, let's to't again.'

She explained to some of them, as he led her to the second dance, what the frock had been meant
for, and that she had put it on at his request. And again athwart and around the room they went.

'You seem the bride!' he said.

'But I couldn't wear this gown to be married in now!' she replied, ecstatically, 'or I shouldn't
have put it on and made it dusty.  It is really too old-fashioned, and so folded and fretted
out, you can't think. That was with my taking it out so many times to look at.  I have never
put it on--never--till now!'

'Selina, I am thinking of giving up the army.  Will you emigrate with me to New Zealand?  I've
an uncle out there doing well, and he'd soon help me to making a larger income.  The English
army is glorious, but it ain't altogether enriching.'

'Of course, anywhere that you decide upon.  Is it healthy there for Johnny?'

'A lovely climate.  And I shall never be happy in England . . . Aha!' he concluded again, with
a bitterness of unexpected strength, 'would to Heaven I had come straight back here!'

As the dance brought round one neighbour after another the re-united pair were thrown into
juxtaposition with Bob Heartall among the rest who had been called in; one whose chronic expression
was that he carried inside him a joke on the point of bursting with its own vastness.  He took
occasion now to let out a little of its quality, shaking his head at Selina as he addressed
her in an undertone--

'This is a bit of a topper to the bridegroom, ho ho!  'Twill teach en the liberty you'll expect
when you've married en!'

'What does he mean by a "topper,"' the sergeant-major asked, who, not being of local extraction,
despised the venerable local language, and also seemed to suppose 'bridegroom' to be an anticipatory
name for himself.  'I only hope I shall never be worse treated than you've treated me to-night!'

Selina looked frightened.  'He didn't mean you, dear,' she said as they moved on.  'We thought
perhaps you knew what had happened, owing to your coming just at this time.  Had you--heard
anything about--what I intended?'

'Not a breath--how should I--away up in Yorkshire?  It was by the merest accident that I came
just at this date to make peace with you for my delay.'

'I was engaged to be married to Mr. Bartholomew Miller.  That's what it is!  I would have let
'ee know by letter, but there was no time, only hearing from 'ee this afternoon . . . You won't
desert me for it, will you, John?  Because, as you know, I quite supposed you dead, and--and--'
Her eyes were full of tears of trepidation, and he might have felt a sob heaving within her.

IV

The soldier was silent during two or three double bars of the tune.  'When were you to have
been married to the said Mr. Bartholomew Miller?' he inquired.

'Quite soon.'

'How soon?'

'Next week--O yes--just the same as it was with you and me.  There's a strange fate of interruption
hanging over me, I sometimes think!  He had bought the licence, which I preferred so that it
mightn't be like--ours. But it made no difference to the fate of it.'

'Had bought the licence!  The devil!'

'Don't be angry, dear John.  I didn't know!'

'No, no, I'm not angry.'

'It was so kind of him, considering!'

'Yes . . . I see, of course, how natural your action was--never thinking of seeing me any more!
Is it the Mr. Miller who is in this dance?'

'Yes.'

Clark glanced round upon Bartholomew and was silent again, for some little while, and she stole
a look at him, to find that he seemed changed.  'John, you look ill!' she almost sobbed.  ''Tisn't
me, is it?'

'O dear, no.  Though I hadn't, somehow, expected it.  I can't find fault with you for a moment--and
I don't . . . This is a deuce of a long dance, don't you think?  We've been at it twenty minutes
if a second, and the figure doesn't allow one much rest.  I'm quite out of breath.'

'They like them so dreadfully long here.  Shall we drop out?  Or I'll stop the fiddler.'

'O no, no, I think I can finish.  But although I look healthy enough I have never been so strong
as I formerly was, since that long illness I had in the hospital at Scutari.'

'And I knew nothing about it!'

'You couldn't, dear, as I didn't write.  What a fool I have been altogether!'  He gave a twitch,
as of one in pain.  'I won't dance again when this one is over.  The fact is I have travelled
a long way to-day, and it seems to have knocked me up a bit.'

There could be no doubt that the sergeant-major was unwell, and Selina made herself miserable
by still believing that her story was the cause of his ailment.  Suddenly he said in a changed
voice, and she perceived that he was paler than ever: 'I must sit down.'

Letting go her waist he went quickly to the other room.  She followed, and found him in the
nearest chair, his face bent down upon his hands and arms, which were resting on the table.

'What's the matter?' said her father, who sat there dozing by the fire.

'John isn't well . . . We are going to New Zealand when we are married, father.  A lovely country!
John, would you like something to drink?'

'A drop o' that Schiedam of old Owlett's, that's under stairs, perhaps,' suggested her father.
'Not that nowadays 'tis much better than licensed liquor.'

'John,' she said, putting her face close to his and pressing his arm. 'Will you have a drop
of spirits or something?'

He did not reply, and Selina observed that his ear and the side of his face were quite white.
Convinced that his illness was serious, a growing dismay seized hold of her.  The dance ended;
her mother came in, and learning what had happened, looked narrowly at the sergeant-major.

'We must not let him lie like that, lift him up,' she said.  'Let him rest in the window-bench
on some cushions.'

They unfolded his arms and hands as they lay clasped upon the table, and on lifting his head
found his features to bear the very impress of death itself.  Bartholomew Miller, who had now
come in, assisted Mr. Paddock to make a comfortable couch in the window-seat, where they stretched
out Clark upon his back.

Still he seemed unconscious.  'We must get a doctor,' said Selina.  'O, my dear John, how is
it you be taken like this?'

'My impression is that he's dead!' murmured Mr. Paddock.  'He don't breathe enough to move
a tomtit's feather.'

There were plenty to volunteer to go for a doctor, but as it would be at least an hour before
he could get there the case seemed somewhat hopeless.  The dancing-party ended as unceremoniously
as it had begun; but the guests lingered round the premises till the doctor should arrive.
When he did come the sergeant-major's extremities were already cold, and there was no doubt
that death had overtaken him almost at the moment that he had sat down.

The medical practitioner quite refused to accept the unhappy Selina's theory that her revelation
had in any way induced Clark's sudden collapse.  Both he and the coroner afterwards, who found
the immediate cause to be heart-failure, held that such a supposition was unwarranted by facts.
They asserted that a long day's journey, a hurried drive, and then an exhausting dance, were
sufficient for such a result upon a heart enfeebled by fatty degeneration after the privations
of a Crimean winter and other trying experiences, the coincidence of the sad event with any
disclosure of hers being a pure accident.

This conclusion, however, did not dislodge Selina's opinion that the shock of her statement
had been the immediate stroke which had felled a constitution so undermined.

V

At this date the Casterbridge Barracks were cavalry quarters, their adaptation to artillery
having been effected some years later.  It had been owing to the fact that the ---th Dragoons,
in which John Clark had served, happened to be lying there that Selina made his acquaintance.
At the time of his death the barracks were occupied by the Scots Greys, but when the pathetic
circumstances of the sergeant-major's end became known in the town the officers of the Greys
offered the services of their fine reed and brass band, that he might have a funeral marked
by due military honours.  His body was accordingly removed to the barracks, and carried thence
to the churchyard in the Durnover quarter on the following afternoon, one of the Greys' most
ancient and docile chargers being blacked up to represent Clark's horse on the occasion.

Everybody pitied Selina, whose story was well known.  She followed the corpse as the only mourner,
Clark having been without relations in this part of the country, and a communication with his
regiment having brought none from a distance.  She sat in a little shabby brown-black mourning
carriage, squeezing herself up in a corner to be as much as possible out of sight during the
slow and dramatic march through the town to the tune from Saul.  When the interment had taken
place, the volleys been fired, and the return journey begun, it was with something like a shock
that she found the military escort to be moving at a quick march to the lively strains of 'Off
she goes!' as if all care for the sergeant-major was expected to be ended with the late discharge
of the carbines.  It was, by chance, the very tune to which they had been footing when he died,
and unable to bear its notes, she hastily told her driver to drop behind.  The band and military
party diminished up the High Street, and Selina turned over Swan bridge and homeward to Mellstock.

Then recommenced for her a life whose incidents were precisely of a suit with those which had
preceded the soldier's return; but how different in her appreciation of them!  Her narrow miss
of the recovered respectability they had hoped for from that tardy event worked upon her parents
as an irritant, and after the first week or two of her mourning her life with them grew almost
insupportable.  She had impulsively taken to herself the weeds of a widow, for such she seemed
to herself to be, and clothed little Johnny in sables likewise.  This assumption of a moral
relationship to the deceased, which she asserted to be only not a legal one by two most unexpected
accidents, led the old people to indulge in sarcasm at her expense whenever they beheld her
attire, though all the while it cost them more pain to utter than it gave her to hear it. 
Having become accustomed by her residence at home to the business carried on by her father,
she surprised them one day by going off with the child to Chalk-Newton, in the direction of
the town of Ivell, and opening a miniature fruit and vegetable shop, attending Ivell market
with her produce.  Her business grew somewhat larger, and it was soon sufficient to enable
her to support herself and the boy in comfort.  She called herself 'Mrs. John Clark' from the
day of leaving home, and painted the name on her signboard--no man forbidding her.

By degrees the pain of her state was forgotten in her new circumstances, and getting to be
generally accepted as the widow of a sergeant-major of dragoons--an assumption which her modest
and mournful demeanour seemed to substantiate--her life became a placid one, her mind being
nourished by the melancholy luxury of dreaming what might have been her future in New Zealand
with John, if he had only lived to take her there.  Her only travels now were a journey to
Ivell on market-days, and once a fortnight to the churchyard in which Clark lay, there to tend,
with Johnny's assistance, as widows are wont to do, the flowers she had planted upon his grave.

On a day about eighteen months after his unexpected decease, Selina was surprised in her lodging
over her little shop by a visit from Bartholomew Miller.  He had called on her once or twice
before, on which occasions he had used without a word of comment the name by which she was known.

'I've come this time,' he said, 'less because I was in this direction than to ask you, Mrs.
Clark, what you mid well guess.  I've come o' purpose, in short.'

She smiled.

''Tis to ask me again to marry you?'

'Yes, of course.  You see, his coming back for 'ee proved what I always believed of 'ee, though
others didn't.  There's nobody but would be glad to welcome you to our parish again, now you've
showed your independence and acted up to your trust in his promise.  Well, my dear, will you come?'

'I'd rather bide as Mrs. Clark, I think,' she answered.  'I am not ashamed of my position at
all; for I am John's widow in the eyes of Heaven.'

'I quite agree--that's why I've come.  Still, you won't like to be always straining at this
shop-keeping and market-standing; and 'twould be better for Johnny if you had nothing to do
but tend him.'

He here touched the only weak spot in Selina's resistance to his proposal--the good of the
boy.  To promote that there were other men she might have married offhand without loving them
if they had asked her to; but though she had known the worthy speaker from her youth, she could
not for the moment fancy herself happy as Mrs. Miller.

He paused awhile.  'I ought to tell 'ee, Mrs. Clark,' he said by and by, 'that marrying is
getting to be a pressing question with me.  Not on my own account at all.  The truth is, that
mother is growing old, and I am away from home a good deal, so that it is almost necessary
there should be another person in the house with her besides me.  That's the practical consideration
which forces me to think of taking a wife, apart from my wish to take you; and you know there's
nobody in the world I care for so much.'

She said something about there being far better women than she, and other natural commonplaces;
but assured him she was most grateful to him for feeling what he felt, as indeed she sincerely
was.  However, Selina would not consent to be the useful third person in his comfortable home--at
any rate just then.  He went away, after taking tea with her, without discerning much hope
for him in her good-bye.

VI

After that evening she saw and heard nothing of him for a great while. Her fortnightly journeys
to the sergeant-major's grave were continued, whenever weather did not hinder them; and Mr.
Miller must have known, she thought, of this custom of hers.  But though the churchyard was
not nearly so far from his homestead as was her shop at Chalk-Newton, he never appeared in
the accidental way that lovers use.

An explanation was forthcoming in the shape of a letter from her mother, who casually mentioned
that Mr. Bartholomew Miller had gone away to the other side of Shottsford-Forum to be married
to a thriving dairyman's daughter that he knew there.  His chief motive, it was reported, had
been less one of love than a wish to provide a companion for his aged mother.

Selina was practical enough to know that she had lost a good and possibly the only opportunity
of settling in life after what had happened, and for a moment she regretted her independence.
But she became calm on reflection, and to fortify herself in her course started that afternoon
to tend the sergeant-major's grave, in which she took the same sober pleasure as at first.

On reaching the churchyard and turning the corner towards the spot as usual, she was surprised
to perceive another woman, also apparently a respectable widow, and with a tiny boy by her
side, bending over Clark's turf, and spudding up with the point of her umbrella some ivy-roots
that Selina had reverently planted there to form an evergreen mantle over the mound.

'What are you digging up my ivy for!' cried Selina, rushing forward so excitedly that Johnny
tumbled over a grave with the force of the tug she gave his hand in her sudden start.

'Your ivy?' said the respectable woman.

'Why yes!  I planted it there--on my husband's grave.'

'Your husband's!'

'Yes.  The late Sergeant-Major Clark.  Anyhow, as good as my husband, for he was just going to be.'

'Indeed.  But who may be my husband, if not he?  I am the only Mrs. John Clark, widow of the
late Sergeant-Major of Dragoons, and this is his only son and heir.'

'How can that be?' faltered Selina, her throat seeming to stick together as she just began
to perceive its possibility.  'He had been--going to marry me twice--and we were going to New
Zealand.'

'Ah!--I remember about you,' returned the legitimate widow calmly and not unkindly.  'You must
be Selina; he spoke of you now and then, and said that his relations with you would always
be a weight on his conscience. Well; the history of my life with him is soon told.  When he
came back from the Crimea he became acquainted with me at my home in the north, and we were
married within a month of first knowing each other. Unfortunately, after living together a
few months, we could not agree; and after a particularly sharp quarrel, in which, perhaps,
I was most in the wrong--as I don't mind owning here by his graveside--he went away from me,
declaring he would buy his discharge and emigrate to New Zealand, and never come back to me
any more.  The next thing I heard was that he had died suddenly at Mellstock at some low carouse;
and as he had left me in such anger to live no more with me, I wouldn't come down to his funeral,
or do anything in relation to him.  'Twas temper, I know, but that was the fact.  Even if we
had parted friends it would have been a serious expense to travel three hundred miles to get
there, for one who wasn't left so very well off . . . I am sorry I pulled up your ivy-roots;
but that common sort of ivy is considered a weed in my part of the country.'

December 1899.

A TRYST AT AN ANCIENT EARTH WORK

At one's every step forward it rises higher against the south sky, with an obtrusive personality
that compels the senses to regard it and consider.  The eyes may bend in another direction,
but never without the consciousness of its heavy, high-shouldered presence at its point of
vantage.  Across the intervening levels the gale races in a straight line from the fort, as
if breathed out of it hitherward.  With the shifting of the clouds the faces of the steeps
vary in colour and in shade, broad lights appearing where mist and vagueness had prevailed,
dissolving in their turn into melancholy gray, which spreads over and eclipses the luminous
bluffs.  In this so-thought immutable spectacle all is change.

Out of the invisible marine region on the other side birds soar suddenly into the air, and
hang over the summits of the heights with the indifference of long familiarity.  Their forms
are white against the tawny concave of cloud, and the curves they exhibit in their floating
signify that they are sea-gulls which have journeyed inland from expected stress of weather.
As the birds rise behind the fort, so do the clouds rise behind the birds, almost as it seems,
stroking with their bagging bosoms the uppermost flyers.

The profile of the whole stupendous ruin, as seen at a distance of a mile eastward, is cleanly
cut as that of a marble inlay.  It is varied with protuberances, which from hereabouts have
the animal aspect of warts, wens, knuckles, and hips.  It may indeed be likened to an enormous
many- limbed organism of an antediluvian time--partaking of the cephalopod in shape--lying
lifeless, and covered with a thin green cloth, which hides its substance, while revealing its
contour.  This dull green mantle of herbage stretches down towards the levels, where the ploughs
have essayed for centuries to creep up near and yet nearer to the base of the castle, but have
always stopped short before reaching it.  The furrows of these environing attempts show themselves
distinctly, bending to the incline as they trench upon it; mounting in steeper curves, till
the steepness baffles them, and their parallel threads show like the striae of waves pausing
on the curl.  The peculiar place of which these are some of the features is 'Mai-Dun,' 'The
Castle of the Great Hill,' said to be the Dunium of Ptolemy, the capital of the Durotriges,
which eventually came into Roman occupation, and was finally deserted on their withdrawal from
the island.

* * * * *

The evening is followed by a night on which an invisible moon bestows a subdued, yet pervasive
light--without radiance, as without blackness. From the spot whereon I am ensconced in a cottage,
a mile away, the fort has now ceased to be visible; yet, as by day, to anybody whose thoughts
have been engaged with it and its barbarous grandeurs of past time the form asserts its existence
behind the night gauzes as persistently as if it had a voice.  Moreover, the south-west wind
continues to feed the intervening arable flats with vapours brought directly from its sides.

The midnight hour for which there has been occasion to wait at length arrives, and I journey
towards the stronghold in obedience to a request urged earlier in the day.  It concerns an
appointment, which I rather regret my decision to keep now that night is come.  The route thither
is hedgeless and treeless--I need not add deserted.  The moonlight is sufficient to disclose
the pale riband-like surface of the way as it trails along between the expanses of darker fallow.
Though the road passes near the fortress it does not conduct directly to its fronts.  As the
place is without an inhabitant, so it is without a trackway.  So presently leaving the macadamized
road to pursue its course elsewhither, I step off upon the fallow, and plod stumblingly across
it.  The castle looms out off the shade by degrees, like a thing waking up and asking what
I want there.  It is now so enlarged by nearness that its whole shape cannot be taken in at
one view.  The ploughed ground ends as the rise sharpens, the sloping basement of grass begins,
and I climb upward to invade Mai-Dun.

Impressive by day as this largest Ancient-British work in the kingdom undoubtedly is, its impressiveness
is increased now.  After standing still and spending a few minutes in adding its age to its
size, and its size to its solitude, it becomes appallingly mournful in its growing closeness.
A squally wind blows in the face with an impact which proclaims that the vapours of the air
sail low to-night.  The slope that I so laboriously clamber up the wind skips sportively down.
Its track can be discerned even in this light by the undulations of the withered grass-bents--the
only produce of this upland summit except moss.  Four minutes of ascent, and a vantage-ground
of some sort is gained.  It is only the crest of the outer rampart.  Immediately within this
a chasm gapes; its bottom is imperceptible, but the counterscarp slopes not too steeply to
admit of a sliding descent if cautiously performed.  The shady bottom, dank and chilly, is
thus gained, and reveals itself as a kind of winding lane, wide enough for a waggon to pass
along, floored with rank herbage, and trending away, right and left, into obscurity, between
the concentric walls of earth.  The towering closeness of these on each hand, their impenetrability,
and their ponderousness, are felt as a physical pressure.  The way is now up the second of
them, which stands steeper and higher than the first.  To turn aside, as did Christian's companion,
from such a Hill Difficulty, is the more natural tendency; but the way to the interior is upward.
There is, of course, an entrance to the fortress; but that lies far off on the other side.
It might possibly have been the wiser course to seek for easier ingress there.

However, being here, I ascend the second acclivity.  The grass stems--the grey beard of the
hill--sway in a mass close to my stooping face.  The dead heads of these various grasses--fescues,
fox-tails, and ryes--bob and twitch as if pulled by a string underground.  From a few thistles
a whistling proceeds; and even the moss speaks, in its humble way, under the stress of the blast.

That the summit of the second line of defence has been gained is suddenly made known by a contrasting
wind from a new quarter, coming over with the curve of a cascade.  These novel gusts raise
a sound from the whole camp or castle, playing upon it bodily as upon a harp.  It is with some
difficulty that a foothold can be preserved under their sweep.  Looking aloft for a moment
I perceive that the sky is much more overcast than it has been hitherto, and in a few instants
a dead lull in what is now a gale ensues with almost preternatural abruptness.  I take advantage
of this to sidle down the second counterscarp, but by the time the ditch is reached the lull
reveals itself to be but the precursor of a storm.  It begins with a heave of the whole atmosphere,
like the sigh of a weary strong man on turning to re-commence unusual exertion, just as I stand
here in the second fosse.  That which now radiates from the sky upon the scene is not so much
light as vaporous phosphorescence.

The wind, quickening, abandons the natural direction it has pursued on the open upland, and
takes the course of the gorge's length, rushing along therein helter-skelter, and carrying
thick rain upon its back.  The rain is followed by hailstones which fly through the defile
in battalions--rolling, hopping, ricochetting, snapping, clattering down the shelving banks
in an undefinable haze of confusion.  The earthen sides of the fosse seem to quiver under the
drenching onset, though it is practically no more to them than the blows of Thor upon the giant
of Jotun-land.  It is impossible to proceed further till the storm somewhat abates, and I draw
up behind a spur of the inner scarp, where possibly a barricade stood two thousand years ago;
and thus await events.

* * * * *

The roar of the storm can be heard travelling the complete circuit of the castle--a measured
mile--coming round at intervals like a circumambulating column of infantry.  Doubtless such
a column has passed this way in its time, but the only columns which enter in these latter
days are the columns of sheep and oxen that are sometimes seen here now; while the only semblance
of heroic voices heard are the utterances of such, and of the many winds which make their passage
through the ravines.

The expected lightning radiates round, and a rumbling as from its subterranean vaults--if there
are any--fills the castle.  The lightning repeats itself, and, coming after the aforesaid thoughts
of martial men, it bears a fanciful resemblance to swords moving in combat.  It has the very
brassy hue of the ancient weapons that here were used.  The so sudden entry upon the scene
of this metallic flame is as the entry of a presiding exhibitor who unrolls the maps, uncurtains
the pictures, unlocks the cabinets, and effects a transformation by merely exposing the materials
of his science, unintelligibly cloaked till then.  The abrupt configuration of the bluffs and
mounds is now for the first time clearly revealed--mounds whereon, doubtless, spears and shields
have frequently lain while their owners loosened their sandals and yawned and stretched their
arms in the sun.  For the first time, too, a glimpse is obtainable of the true entrance used
by its occupants of old, some way ahead.

There, where all passage has seemed to be inviolably barred by an almost vertical facade, the
ramparts are found to overlap each other like loosely clasped fingers, between which a zigzag
path may be followed--a cunning construction that puzzles the uninformed eye.  But its cunning,
even where not obscured by dilapidation, is now wasted on the solitary forms of a few wild
badgers, rabbits, and hares.  Men must have often gone out by those gates in the morning to
battle with the Roman legions under Vespasian; some to return no more, others to come back
at evening, bringing with them the noise of their heroic deeds.  But not a page, not a stone,
has preserved their fame.

* * * * *

Acoustic perceptions multiply to-night.  We can almost hear the stream of years that have borne
those deeds away from us.  Strange articulations seem to float on the air from that point,
the gateway, where the animation in past times must frequently have concentrated itself at
hours of coming and going, and general excitement.  There arises an ineradicable fancy that
they are human voices; if so, they must be the lingering air-borne vibrations of conversations
uttered at least fifteen hundred years ago.  The attention is attracted from mere nebulous
imaginings about yonder spot by a real moving of something close at hand.

I recognize by the now moderate flashes of lightning, which are sheet- like and nearly continuous,
that it is the gradual elevation of a small mound of earth.  At first no larger than a man's
fist it reaches the dimensions of a hat, then sinks a little and is still.  It is but the heaving
of a mole who chooses such weather as this to work in from some instinct that there will be
nobody abroad to molest him.  As the fine earth lifts and lifts and falls loosely aside fragments
of burnt clay roll out of it--clay that once formed part of cups or other vessels used by the
inhabitants of the fortress.

The violence of the storm has been counterbalanced by its transitoriness. From being immersed
in well-nigh solid media of cloud and hail shot with lightning, I find myself uncovered of
the humid investiture and left bare to the mild gaze of the moon, which sparkles now on every
wet grass-blade and frond of moss.

But I am not yet inside the fort, and the delayed ascent of the third and last escarpment is
now made.  It is steeper than either.  The first was a surface to walk up, the second to stagger
up, the third can only be ascended on the hands and toes.  On the summit obtrudes the first
evidence which has been met with in these precincts that the time is really the nineteenth
century; it is in the form of a white notice-board on a post, and the wording can just be discerned
by the rays of the setting moon:

CAUTION.--Any Person found removing Relics, Skeletons, Stones, Pottery, Tiles, or other Material
from this Earthwork, or cutting up the Ground, will be Prosecuted as the Law directs.

Here one observes a difference underfoot from what has gone before: scraps of Roman tile and
stone chippings protrude through the grass in meagre quantity, but sufficient to suggest that
masonry stood on the spot.  Before the eye stretches under the moonlight the interior of the
fort.  So open and so large is it as to be practically an upland plateau, and yet its area
lies wholly within the walls of what may be designated as one building.  It is a long-violated
retreat; all its corner-stones, plinths, and architraves were carried away to build neighbouring
villages even before mediaeval or modern history began.  Many a block which once may have helped
to form a bastion here rests now in broken and diminished shape as part of the chimney-corner
of some shepherd's cottage within the distant horizon, and the corner-stones of this heathen
altar may form the base-course of some adjoining village church.

Yet the very bareness of these inner courts and wards, their condition of mere pasturage, protects
what remains of them as no defences could do. Nothing is left visible that the hands can seize
on or the weather overturn, and a permanence of general outline at least results, which no
other condition could ensure.

The position of the castle on this isolated hill bespeaks deliberate and strategic choice exercised
by some remote mind capable of prospective reasoning to a far extent.  The natural configuration
of the surrounding country and its bearing upon such a stronghold were obviously long considered
and viewed mentally before its extensive design was carried into execution.  Who was the man
that said, 'Let it be built here!'--not on that hill yonder, or on that ridge behind, but on
this best spot of all?  Whether he were some great one of the Belgae, or of the Durotriges,
or the travelling engineer of Britain's united tribes, must for ever remain time's secret;
his form cannot be realized, nor his countenance, nor the tongue that he spoke, when he set
down his foot with a thud and said, 'Let it be here!'

Within the innermost enclosure, though it is so wide that at a superficial glance the beholder
has only a sense of standing on a breezy down, the solitude is rendered yet more solitary by
the knowledge that between the benighted sojourner herein and all kindred humanity are those
three concentric walls of earth which no being would think of scaling on such a night as this,
even were he to hear the most pathetic cries issuing hence that could be uttered by a spectre-chased
soul.  I reach a central mound or platform--the crown and axis of the whole structure.  The
view from here by day must be of almost limitless extent.  On this raised floor, dais, or rostrum,
harps have probably twanged more or less tuneful notes in celebration of daring, strength,
or cruelty; of worship, superstition, love, birth, and death; of simple loving-kindness perhaps
never.  Many a time must the king or leader have directed his keen eyes hence across the open
lands towards the ancient road, the Icening Way, still visible in the distance, on the watch
for armed companies approaching either to succour or to attack.

I am startled by a voice pronouncing my name.  Past and present have become so confusedly mingled
under the associations of the spot that for a time it has escaped my memory that this mound
was the place agreed on for the aforesaid appointment.  I turn and behold my friend.  He stands
with a dark lantern in his hand and a spade and light pickaxe over his shoulder.  He expresses
both delight and surprise that I have come.  I tell him I had set out before the bad weather began.

He, to whom neither weather, darkness, nor difficulty seems to have any relation or significance,
so entirely is his soul wrapped up in his own deep intentions, asks me to take the lantern
and accompany him.  I take it and walk by his side.  He is a man about sixty, small in figure,
with grey old-fashioned whiskers cut to the shape of a pair of crumb-brushes. He is entirely
in black broadcloth--or rather, at present, black and brown, for he is bespattered with mud
from his heels to the crown of his low hat.  He has no consciousness of this--no sense of anything
but his purpose, his ardour for which causes his eyes to shine like those of a lynx, and gives
his motions, all the elasticity of an athlete's.

'Nobody to interrupt us at this time of night!' he chuckles with fierce enjoyment.

We retreat a little way and find a sort of angle, an elevation in the sod, a suggested squareness
amid the mass of irregularities around.  Here, he tells me, if anywhere, the king's house stood.
Three months of measurement and calculation have confirmed him in this conclusion.

He requests me now to open the lantern, which I do, and the light streams out upon the wet
sod.  At last divining his proceedings I say that I had no idea, in keeping the tryst, that
he was going to do more at such an unusual time than meet me for a meditative ramble through
the stronghold. I ask him why, having a practicable object, he should have minded interruptions
and not have chosen the day?  He informs me, quietly pointing to his spade, that it was because
his purpose is to dig, then signifying with a grim nod the gaunt notice-post against the sky
beyond. I inquire why, as a professed and well-known antiquary with capital letters at the
tail of his name, he did not obtain the necessary authority, considering the stringent penalties
for this sort of thing; and he chuckles fiercely again with suppressed delight, and says, 'Because
they wouldn't have given it!'

He at once begins cutting up the sod, and, as he takes the pickaxe to follow on with, assures
me that, penalty or no penalty, honest men or marauders, he is sure of one thing, that we shall
not be disturbed at our work till after dawn.

I remember to have heard of men who, in their enthusiasm for some special science, art, or
hobby, have quite lost the moral sense which would restrain them from indulging it illegitimately;
and I conjecture that here, at last, is an instance of such an one.  He probably guesses the
way my thoughts travel, for he stands up and solemnly asserts that he has a distinctly justifiable
intention in this matter; namely, to uncover, to search, to verify a theory or displace it,
and to cover up again.  He means to take away nothing--not a grain of sand.  In this he says
he sees no such monstrous sin.  I inquire if this is really a promise to me?  He repeats that
it is a promise, and resumes digging.  My contribution to the labour is that of directing the
light constantly upon the hole.  When he has reached something more than a foot deep he digs
more cautiously, saying that, be it much or little there, it will not lie far below the surface;
such things never are deep.  A few minutes later the point of the pickaxe clicks upon a stony
substance.  He draws the implement out as feelingly as if it had entered a man's body.  Taking
up the spade he shovels with care, and a surface, level as an altar, is presently disclosed.
His eyes flash anew; he pulls handfuls of grass and mops the surface clean, finally rubbing
it with his handkerchief.  Grasping the lantern from my hand he holds it close to the ground,
when the rays reveal a complete mosaic--a pavement of minute tesserae of many colours, of intricate
pattern, a work of much art, of much time, and of much industry.  He exclaims in a shout that
he knew it always--that it is not a Celtic stronghold exclusively, but also a Roman; the former
people having probably contributed little more than the original framework which the latter
took and adapted till it became the present imposing structure.

I ask, What if it is Roman?

A great deal, according to him.  That it proves all the world to be wrong in this great argument,
and himself alone to be right!  Can I wait while he digs further?

I agree--reluctantly; but he does not notice my reluctance.  At an adjoining spot he begins
flourishing the tools anew with the skill of a navvy, this venerable scholar with letters after
his name.  Sometimes he falls on his knees, burrowing with his hands in the manner of a hare,
and where his old-fashioned broadcloth touches the sides of the hole it gets plastered with
the damp earth.  He continually murmurs to himself how important, how very important, this
discovery is! In what would intrude you learn.

About half-past eleven he seemed to give up expecting her.  He then went a second time to the
hollow behind the trilithon, remaining there nearly a quarter of an hour.  From this place
he proceeded quickly over a shoulder of the declivity, a little to the left, presently returning
on horseback, which proved that his horse had been tethered in some secret place down there.
Crossing anew the down between the hut and the trilithon, and scanning the precincts as if
finally to assure himself that she had not come, he rode slowly downwards in the direction
of Shakeforest Towers.

The juvenile shepherd thought of what lay in the hollow yonder; and no fear of the crook-stem
of his superior officer was potent enough to detain him longer on that hill alone.  Any live
company, even the most terrible, was better than the company of the dead; so, running with
the speed of a hare in the direction pursued by the horseman, he overtook the revengeful Duke
at the second descent (where the great western road crossed before you came to the old park
entrance on that side--now closed up and the lodge cleared away, though at the time it was
wondered why, being considered the most convenient gate of all).

Once within the sound of the horse's footsteps, Bill Mills felt comparatively comfortable;
for, though in awe of the Duke because of his position, he had no moral repugnance to his companionship
on account of the grisly deed he had committed, considering that powerful nobleman to have
a right to do what he chose on his own lands.  The Duke rode steadily on beneath his ancestral
trees, the hoofs of his horse sending up a smart sound now that he had reached the hard road
of the drive, and soon drew near the front door of his house, surmounted by parapets with square-cut
battlements that cast a notched shade upon the gravelled terrace.  These outlines were quite
familiar to little Bill Mills, though nothing within their boundary had ever been seen by him.

When the rider approached the mansion a small turret door was quickly opened and a woman came
out.  As soon as she saw the horseman's outlines she ran forward into the moonlight to meet him.

'Ah dear--and are you come?' she said.  'I heard Hero's tread just when you rode over the hill,
and I knew it in a moment.  I would have come further if I had been aware--'

'Glad to see me, eh?'

'How can you ask that?'

'Well; it is a lovely night for meetings.'

'Yes, it is a lovely night.'

The Duke dismounted and stood by her side.  'Why should you have been listening at this time
of night, and yet not expecting me?' he asked.

'Why, indeed!  There is a strange story attached to that, which I must tell you at once.  But
why did you come a night sooner than you said you would come?  I am rather sorry--I really
am!' (shaking her head playfully) 'for as a surprise to you I had ordered a bonfire to be built,
which was to be lighted on your arrival to-morrow; and now it is wasted. You can see the outline
of it just out there.'

The Duke looked across to a spot of rising glade, and saw the faggots in a heap.  He then bent
his eyes with a bland and puzzled air on the ground, 'What is this strange story you have to
tell me that kept you awake?' he murmured.

'It is this--and it is really rather serious.  My cousin Fred Ogbourne--Captain Ogbourne as
he is now--was in his boyhood a great admirer of mine, as I think I have told you, though I
was six years his senior.  In strict truth, he was absurdly fond of me.'

'You have never told me of that before.'

'Then it was your sister I told--yes, it was.  Well, you know I have not seen him for many
years, and naturally I had quite forgotten his admiration of me in old times.  But guess my
surprise when the day before yesterday, I received a mysterious note bearing no address, and
found on opening it that it came from him.  The contents frightened me out of my wits.  He
had returned from Canada to his father's house, and conjured me by all he could think of to
meet him at once.  But I think I can repeat the exact words, though I will show it to you when
we get indoors.

   "MY DEAR COUSIN HARRIET," the note said, "After this long absence you
   will be surprised at my sudden reappearance, and more by what I am
   going to ask.  But if my life and future are of any concern to you at
   all, I beg that you will grant my request.  What I require of you, is,
   dear Harriet, that you meet me about eleven to-night by the Druid
   stones on Marlbury Downs, about a mile or more from your house.  I
   cannot say more, except to entreat you to come.  I will explain all
   when you are there.  The one thing is, I want to see you.  Come alone.
   Believe me, I would not ask this if my happiness did not hang upon
   it--God knows how entirely!  I am too agitated to say more--Yours.
   FRED."

'That was all of it.  Now, of course I ought have gone, as it turned out, but that I did not
think of then.  I remembered his impetuous temper, and feared that something grievous was impending
over his head, while he had not a friend in the world to help him, or any one except myself
to whom he would care to make his trouble known.  So I wrapped myself up and went to Marlbury
Downs at the time he had named.  Don't you think I was courageous?'

'Very.'

'When I got there--but shall we not walk on; it is getting cold?'  The Duke, however, did not
move.  'When I got there he came, of course, as a full grown man and officer, and not as the
lad that I had known him.  When I saw him I was sorry I had come.  I can hardly tell you how
he behaved. What he wanted I don't know even now; it seemed to be no more than the mere meeting
with me.  He held me by the hand and waist--O so tight--and would not let me go till I had
promised to meet him again.  His manner was so strange and passionate that I was afraid of
him in such a lonely place, and I promised to come.  Then I escaped--then I ran home--and that's
all.  When the time drew on this evening for the appointment--which, of course, I never intended
to keep, I felt uneasy, lest when he found I meant to disappoint him he would come on to the
house; and that's why I could not sleep.  But you are so silent!'

'I have had a long journey.'

'Then let us get into the house.  Why did you come alone and unattended like this?'

'It was my humour.'

After a moment's silence, during which they moved on, she said, 'I have thought of something
which I hardly like to suggest to you.  He said that if I failed to come to-night he would
wait again to-morrow night.  Now, shall we to-morrow night go to the hill together--just to
see if he is there; and if he is, read him a lesson on his foolishness in nourishing this old
passion, and sending for me so oddly, instead of coming to the house?'

'Why should we see if he's there?' said her husband moodily.

'Because I think we ought to do something in it.  Poor Fred!  He would listen to you if you
reasoned with him, and set our positions in their true light before him.  It would be no more
than Christian kindness to a man who unquestionably is very miserable from some cause or other.
His head seems quite turned.'

By this time they had reached the door, rung the bell, and waited.  All the house seemed to
be asleep; but soon a man came to them, the horse was taken away, and the Duke and Duchess went in.

THIRD NIGHT

There was no help for it.  Bill Mills was obliged to stay on duty, in the old shepherd's absence,
this evening as before, or give up his post and living.  He thought as bravely as he could
of what lay behind the Devil's Door, but with no great success, and was therefore in a measure
relieved, even if awe-stricken, when he saw the forms of the Duke and Duchess strolling across
the frosted greensward.  The Duchess was a few yards in front of her husband and tripped on
lightly.

'I tell you he has not thought it worth while to come again!' the Duke insisted, as he stood
still, reluctant to walk further.

'He is more likely to come and wait all night; and it would be harsh treatment to let him do
it a second time.'

'He is not here; so turn and come home.'

'He seems not to be here, certainly; I wonder if anything has happened to him.  If it has,
I shall never forgive myself!'

The Duke, uneasily, 'O, no.  He has some other engagement.'

'That is very unlikely.'

'Or perhaps he has found the distance too far.'

'Nor is that probable.'

'Then he may have thought better of it.'

'Yes, he may have thought better of it; if, indeed, he is not here all the time--somewhere
in the hollow behind the Devil's Door.  Let us go and see; it will serve him right to surprise
him.'

'O, he's not there.'

'He may be lying very quiet because of you,' she said archly.

'O, no--not because of me!'

'Come, then.  I declare, dearest, you lag like an unwilling schoolboy to- night, and there's
no responsiveness in you!  You are jealous of that poor lad, and it is quite absurd of you.'

'I'll come!  I'll come!  Say no more, Harriet!'  And they crossed over the green.

Wondering what they would do, the young shepherd left the hut, and doubled behind the belt
of furze, intending to stand near the trilithon unperceived.  But, in crossing the few yards
of open ground he was for a moment exposed to view.

'Ah, I see him at last!' said the Duchess.

'See him!' said the Duke.  'Where?'

'By the Devil's Door; don't you notice a figure there?  Ah, my poor lover- cousin, won't you
catch it now?'  And she laughed half-pityingly.  'But what's the matter?' she asked, turning
to her husband.

'It is not he!' said the Duke hoarsely.  'It can't be he!'

'No, it is not he.  It is too small for him.  It is a boy.'

'Ah, I thought so!  Boy, come here.'

The youthful shepherd advanced with apprehension.

'What are you doing here?'

'Keeping sheep, your Grace.'

'Ah, you know me!  Do you keep sheep here every night?'

'Off and on, my Lord Duke.'

'And what have you seen here to-night or last night?' inquired the Duchess.  'Any person waiting
or walking about?'

The boy was silent.

'He has seen nothing,' interrupted her husband, his eyes so forbiddingly fixed on the boy that
they seemed to shine like points of fire.  'Come, let us go.  The air is too keen to stand
in long.'

When they were gone the boy retreated to the hut and sheep, less fearful now than at first--familiarity
with the situation having gradually overpowered his thoughts of the buried man.  But he was
not to be left alone long.  When an interval had elapsed of about sufficient length for walking
to and from Shakeforest Towers, there appeared from that direction the heavy form of the Duke.
He now came alone.

The nobleman, on his part, seemed to have eyes no less sharp than the boy's, for he instantly
recognized the latter among the ewes, and came straight towards him.

'Are you the shepherd lad I spoke to a short time ago?'

'I be, my Lord Duke.'

'Now listen to me.  Her Grace asked you what you had seen this last night or two up here, and
you made no reply.  I now ask the same thing, and you need not be afraid to answer.  Have you
seen anything strange these nights you have been watching here?'

'My Lord Duke, I be a poor heedless boy, and what I see I don't bear in mind.'

'I ask you again,' said the Duke, coming nearer, 'have you seen anything strange these nights
you have been watching here?'

'O, my Lord Duke!  I be but the under-shepherd boy, and my father he was but your humble Grace's
hedger, and my mother only the cinder-woman in the back-yard!  I fall asleep when left alone,
and I see nothing at all!'

The Duke grasped the boy by the shoulder, and, directly impending over him, stared down into
his face, 'Did you see anything strange done here last night, I say?'

'O, my Lord Duke, have mercy, and don't stab me!' cried the shepherd, falling on his knees.
'I have never seen you walking here, or riding here, or lying-in-wait for a man, or dragging
a heavy load!'

'H'm!' said his interrogator, grimly, relaxing his hold.  'It is well to know that you have
never seen those things.  Now, which would you rather--see me do those things now, or keep
a secret all your life?'

'Keep a secret, my Lord Duke!'

'Sure you are able?'

'O, your Grace, try me!'

'Very well.  And now, how do you like sheep-keeping?'

'Not at all.  'Tis lonely work for them that think of spirits, and I'm badly used.'

'I believe you.  You are too young for it.  I must do something to make you more comfortable.
You shall change this smock-frock for a real cloth jacket, and your thick boots for polished
shoes.  And you shall be taught what you have never yet heard of; and be put to school, and
have bats and balls for the holidays, and be made a man of.  But you must never say you have
been a shepherd boy, and watched on the hills at night, for shepherd boys are not liked in
good company.

'Trust me, my Lord Duke.'

'The very moment you forget yourself, and speak of your shepherd days--this year, next year,
in school, out of school, or riding in your carriage twenty years hence--at that moment my
help will be withdrawn, and smash down you come to shepherding forthwith.  You have parents,
I think you say?'

'A widowed mother only, my Lord Duke.'

'I'll provide for her, and make a comfortable woman of her, until you speak of--what?'

'Of my shepherd days, and what I saw here.'

'Good.  If you do speak of it?'

'Smash down she comes to widowing forthwith!'

'That's well--very well.  But it's not enough.  Come here.'  He took the boy across to the
trilithon, and made him kneel down.

'Now, this was once a holy place,' resumed the Duke.  'An altar stood here, erected to a venerable
family of gods, who were known and talked of long before the God we know now.  So that an oath
sworn here is doubly an oath.  Say this after me: "May all the host above--angels and archangels,
and principalities and powers--punish me; may I be tormented wherever I am--in the house or
in the garden, in the fields or in the roads, in church or in chapel, at home or abroad, on
land or at sea; may I be afflicted in eating and in drinking, in growing up and in growing
old, in living and dying, inwardly and outwardly, and for always, if I ever speak of my life
as a shepherd boy, or of what I have seen done on this Marlbury Down.  So be it, and so let
it be.  Amen and amen."  Now kiss the stone.'

The trembling boy repeated the words, and kissed the stone, as desired.

The Duke led him off by the hand.  That night the junior shepherd slept in Shakeforest Towers,
and the next day he was sent away for tuition to a remote village.  Thence he went to a preparatory
establishment, and in due course to a public school.

FOURTH NIGHT

On a winter evening many years subsequent to the above-mentioned occurrences, the ci-devant
shepherd sat in a well-furnished office in the north wing of Shakeforest Towers in the guise
of an ordinary educated man of business.  He appeared at this time as a person of thirty-eight
or forty, though actually he was several years younger.  A worn and restless glance of the
eye now and then, when he lifted his head to search for some letter or paper which had been
mislaid, seemed to denote that his was not a mind so thoroughly at ease as his surroundings
might have led an observer to expect.

His pallor, too, was remarkable for a countryman.  He was professedly engaged in writing, but
he shaped not word.  He had sat there only a few minutes, when, laying down his pen and pushing
back his chair, he rested a hand uneasily on each of the chair-arms and looked on the floor.

Soon he arose and left the room.  His course was along a passage which ended in a central octagonal
hall; crossing this he knocked at a door.  A faint, though deep, voice told him to come in.
The room he entered was the library, and it was tenanted by a single person only--his patron
the Duke.

During this long interval of years the Duke had lost all his heaviness of build.  He was, indeed,
almost a skeleton; his white hair was thin, and his hands were nearly transparent.  'Oh--Mills?'
he murmured.  'Sit down. What is it?'

'Nothing new, your Grace.  Nobody to speak of has written, and nobody has called.'

'Ah--what then?  You look concerned.'

'Old times have come to life, owing to something waking them.'

'Old times be cursed--which old times are they?'

'That Christmas week twenty-two years ago, when the late Duchess's cousin Frederick implored
her to meet him on Marlbury Downs.  I saw the meeting--it was just such a night as this--and
I, as you know, saw more. She met him once, but not the second time.'

'Mills, shall I recall some words to you--the words of an oath taken on that hill by a shepherd-boy?'

'It is unnecessary.  He has strenuously kept that oath and promise.  Since that night no sound
of his shepherd life has crossed his lips--even to yourself.  But do you wish to hear more,
or do you not, your Grace?'

'I wish to hear no more,' said the Duke sullenly.

'Very well; let it be so.  But a time seems coming--may be quite near at hand--when, in spite
of my lips, that episode will allow itself to go undivulged no longer.'

'I wish to hear no more!' repeated the Duke.

'You need be under no fear of treachery from me,' said the steward, somewhat bitterly.  'I
am a man to whom you have been kind--no patron could have been kinder.  You have clothed and
educated me; have installed me here; and I am not unmindful.  But what of it--has your Grace
gained much by my stanchness?  I think not.  There was great excitement about Captain Ogbourne's
disappearance, but I spoke not a word.  And his body has never been found.  For twenty-two
years I have wondered what you did with him.  Now I know.  A circumstance that occurred this
afternoon recalled the time to me most forcibly.  To make it certain to myself that all was
not a dream, I went up there with a spade; I searched, and saw enough to know that something
decays there in a closed badger's hole.'

'Mills, do you think the Duchess guessed?'

'She never did, I am sure, to the day of her death.'

'Did you leave all as you found it on the hill?'

'I did.'

'What made you think of going up there this particular afternoon?'

'What your Grace says you don't wish to be told.'

The Duke was silent; and the stillness of the evening was so marked that there reached their
ears from the outer air the sound of a tolling bell.

'What is that bell tolling for?' asked the nobleman.

'For what I came to tell you of, your Grace.'

'You torment me it is your way!' said the Duke querulously.  'Who's dead in the village?'

'The oldest man--the old shepherd.'

'Dead at last--how old is he?'

'Ninety-four.'

'And I am only seventy.  I have four-and-twenty years to the good!'

'I served under that old man when I kept sheep on Marlbury Downs.  And he was on the hill that
second night, when I first exchanged words with your Grace.  He was on the hill all the time;
but I did not know he was there--nor did you.'

'Ah!' said the Duke, starting up.  'Go on--I yield the point--you may tell!'

'I heard this afternoon that he was at the point of death.  It was that which set me thinking
of that past time--and induced me to search on the hill for what I have told you.  Coming back
I heard that he wished to see the Vicar to confess to him a secret he had kept for more than
twenty years--"out of respect to my Lord the Duke"--something that he had seen committed on
Marlbury Downs when returning to the flock on a December night twenty-two years ago.  I have
thought it over.  He had left me in charge that evening; but he was in the habit of coming
back suddenly, lest I should have fallen asleep.  That night I saw nothing of him, though he
had promised to return.  He must have returned, and--found reason to keep in hiding.  It is
all plain.  The next thing is that the Vicar went to him two hours ago.  Further than that
I have not heard.'

'It is quite enough.  I will see the Vicar at daybreak to-morrow.'

'What to do?'

'Stop his tongue for four-and-twenty years--till I am dead at ninety-four, like the shepherd.'

'Your Grace--while you impose silence on me, I will not speak, even though nay neck should
pay the penalty.  I promised to be yours, and I am yours.  But is this persistence of any avail?'

'I'll stop his tongue, I say!' cried the Duke with some of his old rugged force.  'Now, you
go home to bed, Mills, and leave me to manage him.'

The interview ended, and the steward withdrew.  The night, as he had said, was just such an
one as the night of twenty-two years before, and the events of the evening destroyed in him
all regard for the season as one of cheerfulness and goodwill.  He went off to his own house
on the further verge of the park, where he led a lonely life, scarcely calling any man friend.
At eleven he prepared to retire to bed--but did not retire.  He sat down and reflected.  Twelve
o'clock struck; he looked out at the colourless moon, and, prompted by he knew not what, put
on his hat and emerged into the air.  Here William Mills strolled on and on, till he reached
the top of Marlbury Downs, a spot he had not visited at this hour of the night during the whole
score-and-odd years.

He placed himself, as nearly as he could guess, on the spot where the shepherd's hut had stood.
No lambing was in progress there now, and the old shepherd who had used him so roughly had
ceased from his labours that very day.  But the trilithon stood up white as ever; and, crossing
the intervening sward, the steward fancifully placed his mouth against the stone.  Restless
and self-reproachful as he was, he could not resist a smile as he thought of the terrifying
oath of compact, sealed by a kiss upon the stones of a Pagan temple.  But he had kept his word,
rather as a promise than as a formal vow, with much worldly advantage to himself, though not
much happiness; till increase of years had bred reactionary feelings which led him to receive
the news of to-night with emotions akin to relief.

While leaning against the Devil's Door and thinking on these things, he became conscious that
he was not the only inhabitant of the down.  A figure in white was moving across his front
with long, noiseless strides. Mills stood motionless, and when the form drew quite near he
perceived it to be that of the Duke himself in his nightshirt--apparently walking in his sleep.
Not to alarm the old man, Mills clung close to the shadow of the stone.  The Duke went straight
on into the hollow.  There he knelt down, and began scratching the earth with his hands like
a badger.  After a few minutes he arose, sighed heavily, and retraced his steps as he had come.

Fearing that he might harm himself, yet unwilling to arouse him, the steward followed noiselessly.
The Duke kept on his path unerringly, entered the park, and made for the house, where he let
himself in by a window that stood open--the one probably by which he had come out.  Mills softly
closed the window behind his patron, and then retired homeward to await the revelations of
the morning, deeming it unnecessary to alarm the house.

However, he felt uneasy during the remainder of the night, no less on account of the Duke's
personal condition than because of that which was imminent next day.  Early in the morning
he called at Shakeforest Towers. The blinds were down, and there was something singular upon
the porter's face when he opened the door.  The steward inquired for the Duke.

The man's voice was subdued as he replied: 'Sir, I am sorry to say that his Grace is dead!
He left his room some time in the night, and wandered about nobody knows where.  On returning
to the upper floor he lost his balance and fell downstairs.'

The steward told the tale of the Down before the Vicar had spoken.  Mills had always intended
to do so after the death of the Duke.  The consequences to himself he underwent cheerfully;
but his life was not prolonged.  He died, a farmer at the Cape, when still somewhat under forty-nine
years of age.

The splendid Marlbury breeding flock is as renowned as ever, and, to the eye, seems the same
in every particular that it was in earlier times; but the animals which composed it on the
occasion of the events gathered from the Justice are divided by many ovine generations from
its members now. Lambing Corner has long since ceased to be used for lambing purposes, though
the name still lingers on as the appellation of the spot.  This abandonment of site may be
partly owing to the removal of the high furze bushes which lent such convenient shelter at
that date.  Partly, too, it may be due to another circumstance.  For it is said by present
shepherds in that district that during the nights of Christmas week flitting shapes are seen
in the open space around the trilithon, together with the gleam of a weapon, and the shadow
of a man dragging a burden into the hollow. But of these things there is no certain testimony.

Christmas 1881.

A COMMITTEE-MAN OF 'THE TERROR'

  Yet she was a little moved.  "He did it on principle,"
she would murmur.  "He had no animosity towards them, and profited nothing!"

'She wondered how he lived.  It was evident that he could not be so poor as she had thought;
his pretended poverty might be to escape notice.  She could not tell, but she knew that she
was dangerously interested in him.

'And he still mended, till his thin, pale face became more full and firm. As he mended she
had to meet that request of his, advanced with even stronger insistency.

'The arrival of the King and Court for the season as usual brought matters to a climax for
these two lonely exiles and fellow country-people.  The King's awkward preference for a part
of the coast in such dangerous proximity to France made it necessary that a strict military
vigilance should be exercised to guard the royal residents.  Half- a-dozen frigates were every
night posted in a line across the bay, and two lines of sentinels, one at the water's edge
and another behind the Esplanade, occupied the whole sea-front after eight every night.  The
watering-place was growing an inconvenient residence even for Mademoiselle V--- herself, her
friendship for this strange French tutor and writing-master who never had any pupils having
been observed by many who slightly knew her.  The General's wife, whose dependent she was,
repeatedly warned her against the acquaintance; while the Hanoverian and other soldiers of
the Foreign Legion, who had discovered the nationality of her friend, were more aggressive
than the English military gallants who made it their business to notice her.

'In this tense state of affairs her answers became more agitated.  "O Heaven, how can I marry
you!" she would say.

'"You will; surely you will!" he answered again.  "I don't leave without you.  And I shall
soon be interrogated before the magistrates if I stay here; probably imprisoned.  You will come?"

'She felt her defences breaking down.  Contrary to all reason and sense of family honour she
was, by some abnormal craving, inclining to a tenderness for him that was founded on its opposite.
Sometimes her warm sentiments burnt lower than at others, and then the enormity of her conduct
showed itself in more staring hues.

'Shortly after this he came with a resigned look on his face.  "It is as I expected," he said.
"I have received a hint to go.  In good sooth, I am no Bonapartist--I am no enemy to England;
but the presence of the King made it impossible for a foreigner with no visible occupation,
and who may be a spy, to remain at large in the town.  The authorities are civil, but firm.
They are no more than reasonable.  Good.  I must go.  You must come also."

'She did not speak.  But she nodded assent, her eyes drooping.

'On her way back to the house on the Esplanade she said to herself, "I am glad, I am glad!
I could not do otherwise.  It is rendering good for evil!"  But she knew how she mocked herself
in this, and that the moral principle had not operated one jot in her acceptance of him.  In
truth she had not realized till now the full presence of the emotion which had unconsciously
grown up in her for this lonely and severe man, who, in her tradition, was vengeance and irreligion
personified.  He seemed to absorb her whole nature, and, absorbing, to control it.

'A day or two before the one fixed for the wedding there chanced to come to her a letter from
the only acquaintance of her own sex and country she possessed in England, one to whom she
had sent intelligence of her approaching marriage, without mentioning with whom.  This friend's
misfortunes had been somewhat similar to her own, which fact had been one cause of their intimacy;
her friend's sister, a nun of the Abbey of Montmartre, having perished on the scaffold at the
hands of the same Comite de Salut Public which had numbered Mademoiselle V--'s affianced among
its members.  The writer had felt her position much again of late, since the renewal of the
war, she said; and the letter wound up with a fresh denunciation of the authors of their mutual
bereavement and subsequent troubles.

'Coming just then, its contents produced upon Mademoiselle V--- the effect of a pail of water
upon a somnambulist.  What had she been doing in betrothing herself to this man!  Was she not
making herself a parricide after the event?  At this crisis in her feelings her lover called.
He beheld her trembling, and, in reply to his question, she told him of her scruples with impulsive
candour.

'She had not intended to do this, but his attitude of tender command coerced her into frankness.
Thereupon he exhibited an agitation never before apparent in him.  He said, "But all that is
past.  You are the symbol of Charity, and we are pledged to let bygones be."

'His words soothed her for the moment, but she was sadly silent, and he went away.

'That night she saw (as she firmly believed to the end of her life) a divinely sent vision.
A procession of her lost relatives--father, brother, uncle, cousin--seemed to cross her chamber
between her bed and the window, and when she endeavoured to trace their features she perceived
them to be headless, and that she had recognized them by their familiar clothes only.  In the
morning she could not shake off the effects of this appearance on her nerves.  All that day
she saw nothing of her wooer, he being occupied in making arrangements for their departure.
It grew towards evening--the marriage eve; but, in spite of his re-assuring visit, her sense
of family duty waxed stronger now that she was left alone.  Yet, she asked herself, how could
she, alone and unprotected, go at this eleventh hour and reassert to an affianced husband that
she could not and would not marry him while admitting at the same time that she loved him?
The situation dismayed her.  She had relinquished her post as governess, and was staying temporarily
in a room near the coach-office, where she expected him to call in the morning to carry out
the business of their union and departure.

'Wisely or foolishly, Mademoiselle V--- came to a resolution: that her only safety lay in flight.
His contiguity influenced her too sensibly; she could not reason.  So packing up her few possessions
and placing on the table the small sum she owed, she went out privately, secured a last available
seat in the London coach, and, almost before she had fully weighed her action, she was rolling
out of the town in the dusk of the September evening.

'Having taken this startling step she began to reflect upon her reasons. He had been one of
that tragic Committee the sound of whose name was a horror to the civilized world; yet he had
been only one of several members, and, it seemed, not the most active.  He had marked down
names on principle, had felt no personal enmity against his victims, and had enriched himself
not a sou out of the office he had held.  Nothing could change the past.  Meanwhile he loved
her, and her heart inclined to as much of him as she could detach from that past.  Why not,
as he had suggested, bury memories, and inaugurate a new era by this union?  In other words,
why not indulge her tenderness, since its nullification could do no good.

'Thus she held self-communion in her seat in the coach, passing through Casterbridge, and Shottsford,
and on to the White Hart at Melchester, at which place the whole fabric of her recent intentions
crumbled down. Better be staunch having got so far; let things take their course, and marry
boldly the man who had so impressed her.  How great he was; how small was she!  And she had
presumed to judge him!  Abandoning her place in the coach with the precipitancy that had characterized
her taking it, she waited till the vehicle had driven off, something in the departing shapes
of the outside passengers against the starlit sky giving her a start, as she afterwards remembered.
Presently the down coach, "The Morning Herald," entered the city, and she hastily obtained
a place on the top.

'"I'll be firm--I'll be his--if it cost me my immortal soul!" she said. And with troubled breathings
she journeyed back over the road she had just traced.

'She reached our royal watering-place by the time the day broke, and her first aim was to get
back to the hired room in which her last few days had been spent.  When the landlady appeared
at the door in response to Mademoiselle V--'s nervous summons, she explained her sudden departure
and return as best she could; and no objection being offered to her re- engagement of the room
for one day longer she ascended to the chamber and sat down panting.  She was back once more,
and her wild tergiversations were a secret from him whom alone they concerned.

'A sealed letter was on the mantelpiece.  "Yes, it is directed to you, Mademoiselle," said
the woman who had followed her.  "But we were wondering what to do with it.  A town messenger
brought it after you had gone last night."

'When the landlady had left, Mademoiselle V--- opened the letter and read--

   "MY DEAR AND HONOURED FRIEND.--You have been throughout our
   acquaintance absolutely candid concerning your misgivings.  But I have
   been reserved concerning mine.  That is the difference between us.  You
   probably have not guessed that every qualm you have felt on the
   subject of our marriage has been paralleled in my heart to the full.
   Thus it happened that your involuntary outburst of remorse yesterday,
   though mechanically deprecated by me in your presence, was a last item
   in my own doubts on the wisdom of our union, giving them a force that
   I could no longer withstand.  I came home; and, on reflection, much as
   I honour and adore you, I decide to set you free.

   "As one whose life has been devoted, and I may say sacrificed, to the
   cause of Liberty, I cannot allow your judgment (probably a permanent
   one) to be fettered beyond release by a feeling which may be transient
   only.

   "It would be no less than excruciating to both that I should announce
   this decision to you by word of mouth.  I have therefore taken the
   less painful course of writing.  Before you receive this I shall have
   left the town by the evening coach for London, on reaching which city
   my movements will be revealed to none.

   "Regard me, Mademoiselle, as dead, and accept my renewed assurances of
   respect, remembrance, and affection."

'When she had recovered from her shock of surprise and grief, she remembered that at the starting
of the coach out of Melchester before dawn, the shape of a figure among the outside passengers
against the starlit sky had caused her a momentary start, from its resemblance to that of her
friend.  Knowing nothing of each other's intentions, and screened from each other by the darkness,
they had left the town by the same conveyance.  "He, the greater, persevered; I, the smaller,
returned!" she said.

'Recovering from her stupor, Mademoiselle V--- bethought herself again of her employer, Mrs.
Newbold, whom recent events had estranged.  To that lady she went with a full heart, and explained
everything.  Mrs. Newbold kept to herself her opinion of the episode, and reinstalled the deserted
bride in her old position as governess to the family.

'A governess she remained to the end of her days.  After the final peace with France she became
acquainted with my mother, to whom by degrees she imparted these experiences of hers.  As her
hair grew white, and her features pinched, Mademoiselle V--- would wonder what nook of the
world contained her lover, if he lived, and if by any chance she might see him again.  But
when, some time in the 'twenties, death came to her, at no great age, that outline against
the stars of the morning remained as the last glimpse she ever obtained of her family's foe
and her once affianced husband.'

1895.

MASTER JOHN HORSELEIGH, KNIGHT

In the earliest and mustiest volume of the Havenpool marriage registers (said the thin-faced
gentleman) this entry may still be read by any one curious enough to decipher the crabbed handwriting
of the date.  I took a copy of it when I was last there; and it runs thus (he had opened his
pocket-book, and now read aloud the extract; afterwards handing round the book to us, wherein
we saw transcribed the following)--

   Mastr John Horseleigh, Knyght, of the p'ysshe of Clyffton was maryd to
   Edith the wyffe late off John Stocker, m'chawnte of Havenpool the
   xiiij daje of December be p'vylegge gevyn by our sup'me hedd of the
   chyrche of Ingelonde Kynge Henry the viii th 1539.

Now, if you turn to the long and elaborate pedigree of the ancient family of the Horseleighs
of Clyfton Horseleigh, you will find no mention whatever of this alliance, notwithstanding
the privilege given by the Sovereign and head of the Church; the said Sir John being therein
chronicled as marrying, at a date apparently earlier than the above, the daughter and heiress
of Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether Wessex, a lady who outlived him, of which marriage
there were issue two daughters and a son, who succeeded him in his estates.  How are we to
account for these, as it would seem, contemporaneous wives?  A strange local tradition only
can help us, and this can be briefly told.

One evening in the autumn of the year 1540 or 1541, a young sailor, whose Christian name was
Roger, but whose surname is not known, landed at his native place of Havenpool, on the South
Wessex coast, after a voyage in the Newfoundland trade, then newly sprung into existence. 
He returned in the ship Primrose with a cargo of 'trayne oyle brought home from the New Founde
Lande,' to quote from the town records of the date.  During his absence of two summers and
a winter, which made up the term of a Newfoundland 'spell,' many unlooked-for changes had occurred
within the quiet little seaport, some of which closely affected Roger the sailor.  At the time
of his departure his only sister Edith had become the bride of one Stocker, a respectable townsman,
and part owner of the brig in which Roger had sailed; and it was to the house of this couple,
his only relatives, that the young man directed his steps.  On trying the door in Quay Street
he found it locked, and then observed that the windows were boarded up.  Inquiring of a bystander,
he learnt for the first time of the death of his brother-in-law, though that event had taken
place nearly eighteen months before.

'And my sister Edith?' asked Roger.

'She's married again--as they do say, and hath been so these twelve months.  I don't vouch
for the truth o't, though if she isn't she ought to be.'

Roger's face grew dark.  He was a man with a considerable reserve of strong passion, and he
asked his informant what he meant by speaking thus.

The man explained that shortly after the young woman's bereavement a stranger had come to the
port.  He had seen her moping on the quay, had been attracted by her youth and loneliness,
and in an extraordinarily brief wooing had completely fascinated her--had carried her off,
and, as was reported, had married her.  Though he had come by water, he was supposed to live
no very great distance off by land.  They were last heard of at Oozewood, in Upper Wessex,
at the house of one Wall, a timber- merchant, where, he believed, she still had a lodging,
though her husband, if he were lawfully that much, was but an occasional visitor to the place.

'The stranger?' asked Roger.  'Did you see him?  What manner of man was he?'

'I liked him not,' said the other.  'He seemed of that kind that hath something to conceal,
and as he walked with her he ever and anon turned his head and gazed behind him, as if he much
feared an unwelcome pursuer. But, faith,' continued he, 'it may have been the man's anxiety
only.  Yet did I not like him.'

'Was he older than my sister?' Roger asked.

'Ay--much older; from a dozen to a score of years older.  A man of some position, maybe, playing
an amorous game for the pleasure of the hour. Who knoweth but that he have a wife already?
Many have done the thing hereabouts of late.'

Having paid a visit to the graves of his relatives, the sailor next day went along the straight
road which, then a lane, now a highway, conducted to the curious little inland town named by
the Havenpool man.  It is unnecessary to describe Oozewood on the South-Avon.  It has a railway
at the present day; but thirty years of steam traffic past its precincts have hardly modified
its original features.  Surrounded by a sort of fresh-water lagoon, dividing it from meadows
and coppice, its ancient thatch and timber houses have barely made way even in the front street
for the ubiquitous modern brick and slate.  It neither increases nor diminishes in size; it
is difficult to say what the inhabitants find to do, for, though trades in woodware are still
carried on, there cannot be enough of this class of work nowadays to maintain all the householders,
the forests around having been so greatly thinned and curtailed.  At the time of this tradition
the forests were dense, artificers in wood abounded, and the timber trade was brisk.  Every
house in the town, without exception, was of oak framework, filled in with plaster, and covered
with thatch, the chimney being the only brick portion of the structure.  Inquiry soon brought
Roger the sailor to the door of Wall, the timber-dealer referred to, but it was some time before
he was able to gain admission to the lodging of his sister, the people having plainly received
directions not to welcome strangers.

She was sitting in an upper room on one of the lath-backed, willow-bottomed 'shepherd's' chairs,
made on the spot then as to this day, and as they were probably made there in the days of the
Heptarchy. In her lap was an infant, which she had been suckling, though now it had fallen
asleep; so had the young mother herself for a few minutes, under the drowsing effects of solitude.
Hearing footsteps on the stairs, she awoke, started up with a glad cry, and ran to the door,
opening which she met her brother on the threshold.

'O, this is merry; I didn't expect 'ee!' she said.  'Ah, Roger--I thought it was John.'  Her
tones fell to disappointment.

The sailor kissed her, looked at her sternly for a few moments, and pointing to the infant,
said, 'You mean the father of this?'

'Yes, my husband,' said Edith.

'I hope so,' he answered.

'Why, Roger, I'm married--of a truth am I!' she cried.

'Shame upon 'ee, if true!  If not true, worse.  Master Stocker was an honest man, and ye should
have respected his memory longer.  Where is thy husband?'

'He comes often.  I thought it was he now.  Our marriage has to be kept secret for a while--it
was done privily for certain reasons; but we was married at church like honest folk--afore
God we were, Roger, six months after poor Stocker's death.'

''Twas too soon,' said Roger.

'I was living in a house alone; I had nowhere to go to.  You were far over sea in the New Found
Land, and John took me and brought me here.'

'How often doth he come?' says Roger again.

'Once or twice weekly,' says she.

'I wish th' 'dst waited till I returned, dear Edy,' he said.  'It mid be you are a wife--I
hope so.  But, if so, why this mystery?  Why this mean and cramped lodging in this lonely copse-circled
town?  Of what standing is your husband, and of where?'

'He is of gentle breeding--his name is John.  I am not free to tell his family-name.  He is
said to be of London, for safety' sake; but he really lives in the county next adjoining this.'

'Where in the next county?'

'I do not know.  He has preferred not to tell me, that I may not have the secret forced from
me, to his and my hurt, by bringing the marriage to the ears of his kinsfolk and friends.'

Her brother's face flushed.  'Our people have been honest townsmen, well- reputed for long;
why should you readily take such humbling from a sojourner of whom th' 'st know nothing?'

They remained in constrained converse till her quick ear caught a sound, for which she might
have been waiting--a horse's footfall.  'It is John!' said she.  'This is his night--Saturday.'

'Don't be frightened lest he should find me here!' said Roger.  'I am on the point of leaving.
I wish not to be a third party.  Say nothing at all about my visit, if it will incommode you
so to do.  I will see thee before I go afloat again.'

Speaking thus he left the room, and descending the staircase let himself out by the front door,
thinking he might obtain a glimpse of the approaching horseman.  But that traveller had in
the meantime gone stealthily round to the back of the homestead, and peering along the pinion-end
of the house Roger discerned him unbridling and haltering his horse with his own hands in the
shed there.

Roger retired to the neighbouring inn called the Black Lamb, and meditated.  This mysterious
method of approach determined him, after all, not to leave the place till he had ascertained
more definite facts of his sister's position--whether she were the deluded victim of the stranger
or the wife she obviously believed herself to be.  Having eaten some supper, he left the inn,
it being now about eleven o'clock.  He first looked into the shed, and, finding the horse still
standing there, waited irresolutely near the door of his sister's lodging.  Half an hour elapsed,
and, while thinking he would climb into a loft hard by for a night's rest, there seemed to
be a movement within the shutters of the sitting-room that his sister occupied.  Roger hid
himself behind a faggot- stack near the back door, rightly divining that his sister's visitor
would emerge by the way he had entered.  The door opened, and the candle she held in her hand
lighted for a moment the stranger's form, showing it to be that of a tall and handsome personage,
about forty years of age, and apparently of a superior position in life.  Edith was assisting
him to cloak himself, which being done he took leave of her with a kiss and left the house.
From the door she watched him bridle and saddle his horse, and having mounted and waved an
adieu to her as she stood candle in hand, he turned out of the yard and rode away.

The horse which bore him was, or seemed to be, a little lame, and Roger fancied from this that
the rider's journey was not likely to be a long one.  Being light of foot he followed apace,
having no great difficulty on such a still night in keeping within earshot some few miles,
the horseman pausing more than once.  In this pursuit Roger discovered the rider to choose
bridle-tracks and open commons in preference to any high road.  The distance soon began to
prove a more trying one than he had bargained for; and when out of breath and in some despair
of being able to ascertain the man's identity, he perceived an ass standing in the starlight
under a hayrick, from which the animal was helping itself to periodic mouthfuls.

The story goes that Roger caught the ass, mounted, and again resumed the trail of the unconscious
horseman, which feat may have been possible to a nautical young fellow, though one can hardly
understand how a sailor would ride such an animal without bridle or saddle, and strange to
his hands, unless the creature were extraordinarily docile.  This question, however, is immaterial.
Suffice it to say that at dawn the following morning Roger beheld his sister's lover or husband
entering the gates of a large and well-timbered park on the south-western verge of the White
Hart Forest (as it was then called), now known to everybody as the Vale of Blackmoor.  Thereupon
the sailor discarded his steed, and finding for himself an obscurer entrance to the same park
a little further on, he crossed the grass to reconnoitre.

He presently perceived amid the trees before him a mansion which, new to himself, was one of
the best known in the county at that time.  Of this fine manorial residence hardly a trace
now remains; but a manuscript dated some years later than the events we are regarding describes
it in terms from which the imagination may construct a singularly clear and vivid picture.
This record presents it as consisting of 'a faire yellow freestone building, partly two and
partly three storeys; a faire halle and parlour, both waynscotted; a faire dyning roome and
withdrawing roome, and many good lodgings; a kitchen adjoyninge backwarde to one end of the
dwelling-house, with a faire passage from it into the halle, parlour, and dyninge roome, and
sellars adjoyninge.

'In the front of the house a square greene court, and a curious gatehouse with lodgings in
it, standing with the front of the house to the south; in a large outer court three stables,
a coach-house, a large barne, and a stable for oxen and kyne, and all houses necessary.

'Without the gatehouse, paled in, a large square greene, in which standeth a faire chappell;
of the south-east side of the greene court, towards the river, a large garden.

'Of the south-west side of the greene court is a large bowling greene, with fower mounted walks
about it, all walled about with a batteled wall, and sett with all sorts of fruit; and out
of it into the feildes there are large walks under many tall elmes orderly planted.'

Then follows a description of the orchards and gardens; the servants' offices, brewhouse, bakehouse,
dairy, pigeon-houses, and corn-mill; the river and its abundance of fish; the warren, the coppices,
the walks; ending thus--

'And all the country north of the house, open champaign, sandy feildes, very dry and pleasant
for all kindes of recreation, huntinge, and hawkinge, and profitble for tillage . . . The house
hath a large prospect east, south, and west, over a very large and pleasant vale . . . is seated
from the good markett towns of Sherton Abbas three miles, and Ivel a mile, that plentifully
yield all manner of provision; and within twelve miles of the south sea.'

It was on the grass before this seductive and picturesque structure that the sailor stood at
gaze under the elms in the dim dawn of Sunday morning, and saw to his surprise his sister's
lover and horse vanish within the court of the building.

Perplexed and weary, Roger slowly retreated, more than ever convinced that something was wrong
in his sister's position.  He crossed the bowling green to the avenue of elms, and, bent on
further research, was about to climb into one of these, when, looking below, he saw a heap
of hay apparently for horses or deer.  Into this he crept, and, having eaten a crust of bread
which he had hastily thrust into his pocket at the inn, he curled up and fell asleep, the hay
forming a comfortable bed, and quite covering him over.

He slept soundly and long, and was awakened by the sound of a bell.  On peering from the hay
he found the time had advanced to full day; the sun was shining brightly.  The bell was that
of the 'faire chappell' on the green outside the gatehouse, and it was calling to matins. 
Presently the priest crossed the green to a little side-door in the chancel, and then from
the gateway of the mansion emerged the household, the tall man whom Roger had seen with his
sister on the previous night, on his arm being a portly dame, and, running beside the pair,
two little girls and a boy. These all entered the chapel, and the bell having ceased and the
environs become clear, the sailor crept out from his hiding.

He sauntered towards the chapel, the opening words of the service being audible within.  While
standing by the porch he saw a belated servitor approaching from the kitchen-court to attend
the service also.  Roger carelessly accosted him, and asked, as an idle wanderer, the name
of the family he had just seen cross over from the mansion.

'Od zounds! if ye modden be a stranger here in very truth, goodman.  That wer Sir John and
his dame, and his children Elizabeth, Mary, and John.'

'I be from foreign parts.  Sir John what d'ye call'n?'

'Master John Horseleigh, Knight, who had a'most as much lond by inheritance of his mother as
'a had by his father, and likewise some by his wife.  Why, bain't his arms dree goolden horses'
heads, and idden his lady the daughter of Master Richard Phelipson, of Montislope, in Nether
Wessex, known to us all?'

'It mid be so, and yet it mid not.  However, th' 'lt miss thy prayers for such an honest knight's
welfare, and I have to traipse seaward many miles.'

He went onward, and as he walked continued saying to himself, 'Now to that poor wronged fool
Edy.  The fond thing!  I thought it; 'twas too quick--she was ever amorous.  What's to become
of her!  God wot!  How be I going to face her with the news, and how be I to hold it from her?
To bring this disgrace on my father's honoured name, a double-tongued knave!'  He turned and
shook his fist at the chapel and all in it, and resumed his way.

Perhaps it was owing to the perplexity of his mind that, instead of returning by the direct
road towards his sister's obscure lodging in the next county, he followed the highway to Casterbridge,
some fifteen miles off, where he remained drinking hard all that afternoon and evening, and
where he lay that and two or three succeeding nights, wandering thence along the Anglebury
road to some village that way, and lying the Friday night after at his native place of Havenpool.
The sight of the familiar objects there seems to have stirred him anew to action, and the next
morning he was observed pursuing the way to Oozewood that he had followed on the Saturday previous,
reckoning, no doubt, that Saturday night would, as before, be a time for finding Sir John with
his sister again.

He delayed to reach the place till just before sunset.  His sister was walking in the meadows
at the foot of the garden, with a nursemaid who carried the baby, and she looked up pensively
when he approached.  Anxiety as to her position had already told upon her once rosy cheeks
and lucid eyes.  But concern for herself and child was displaced for the moment by her regard
of Roger's worn and haggard face.

'Why--you are sick, Roger--you are tired!  Where have you been these many days?  Why not keep
me company a bit--my husband is much away?  And we have hardly spoke at all of dear father
and of your voyage to the New Land.  Why did you go away so suddenly?  There is a spare chamber
at my lodging.'

'Come indoors,' he said.  'We'll talk now--talk a good deal.  As for him [nodding to the child],
better heave him into the river; better for him and you!'

She forced a laugh, as if she tried to see a good joke in the remark, and they went silently
indoors.

'A miserable hole!' said Roger, looking round the room.

'Nay, but 'tis very pretty!'

'Not after what I've seen.  Did he marry 'ee at church in orderly fashion?'

'He did sure--at our church at Havenpool.'

'But in a privy way?'

'Ay--because of his friends--it was at night-time.'

'Ede, ye fond one--for all that he's not thy husband!  Th' 'rt not his wife; and the child
is a bastard.  He hath a wife and children of his own rank, and bearing his name; and that's
Sir John Horseleigh, of Clyfton Horseleigh, and not plain Jack, as you think him, and your
lawful husband.  The sacrament of marriage is no safeguard nowadays.  The King's new-made headship
of the Church hath led men to practise these tricks lightly.'

She had turned white.  'That's not true, Roger!' she said.  'You are in liquor, my brother,
and you know not what you say!  Your seafaring years have taught 'ee bad things!'

'Edith--I've seen them; wife and family--all.  How canst--'

They were sitting in the gathered darkness, and at that moment steps were heard without.  'Go
out this way,' she said.  'It is my husband.  He must not see thee in this mood.  Get away
till to-morrow, Roger, as you care for me.'

She pushed her brother through a door leading to the back stairs, and almost as soon as it
was closed her visitor entered.  Roger, however, did not retreat down the stairs; he stood
and looked through the bobbin-hole. If the visitor turned out to be Sir John, he had determined
to confront him.

It was the knight.  She had struck a light on his entry, and he kissed the child, and took
Edith tenderly by the shoulders, looking into her face.

'Something's gone awry wi' my dear!' he said.  'What is it?  What's the matter?'

'O, Jack!' she cried.  'I have heard such a fearsome rumour--what doth it mean?  He who told
me is my best friend.  He must be deceived!  But who deceived him, and why?  Jack, I was just
told that you had a wife living when you married me, and have her still!'

'A wife?--H'm.'

'Yes, and children.  Say no, say no!'

'By God!  I have no lawful wife but you; and as for children, many or few, they are all bastards,
save this one alone!'

'And that you be Sir John Horseleigh of Clyfton?'

'I mid be.  I have never said so to 'ee.'

'But Sir John is known to have a lady, and issue of her!'

The knight looked down.  'How did thy mind get filled with such as this?' he asked.

'One of my kindred came.'

'A traitor!  Why should he mar our life?  Ah! you said you had a brother at sea--where is he now?'

'Here!' came from close behind him.  And flinging open the door, Roger faced the intruder.
'Liar!' he said, 'to call thyself her husband!'

Sir John fired up, and made a rush at the sailor, who seized him by the collar, and in the
wrestle they both fell, Roger under.  But in a few seconds he contrived to extricate his right
arm, and drawing from his belt a knife which he wore attached to a cord round his neck he opened
it with his teeth, and struck it into the breast of Sir John stretched above him.  Edith had
during these moments run into the next room to place the child in safety, and when she came
back the knight was relaxing his hold on Roger's throat.  He rolled over upon his back and groaned.

The only witness of the scene save the three concerned was the nursemaid, who had brought in
the child on its father's arrival.  She stated afterwards that nobody suspected Sir John had
received his death wound; yet it was so, though he did not die for a long while, meaning thereby
an hour or two; that Mistress Edith continually endeavoured to staunch the blood, calling her
brother Roger a wretch, and ordering him to get himself gone; on which order he acted, after
a gloomy pause, by opening the window, and letting himself down by the sill to the ground.

It was then that Sir John, in difficult accents, made his dying declaration to the nurse and
Edith, and, later, the apothecary; which was to this purport, that the Dame Horseleigh who
passed as his wife at Clyfton, and who had borne him three children, was in truth and deed,
though unconsciously, the wife of another man.  Sir John had married her several years before,
in the face of the whole county, as the widow of one Decimus Strong, who had disappeared shortly
after her union with him, having adventured to the North to join the revolt of the Nobles,
and on that revolt being quelled retreated across the sea.  Two years ago, having discovered
this man to be still living in France, and not wishing to disturb the mind and happiness of
her who believed herself his wife, yet wishing for legitimate issue, Sir John had informed
the King of the facts, who had encouraged him to wed honestly, though secretly, the young merchant's
widow at Havenpool; she being, therefore, his lawful wife, and she only.  That to avoid all
scandal and hubbub he had purposed to let things remain as they were till fair opportunity
should arise of making the true case known with least pain to all parties concerned, but that,
having been thus suspected and attacked by his own brother-in-law, his zest for such schemes
and for all things had died out in him, and he only wished to commend his soul to God.

That night, while the owls were hooting from the forest that encircled the sleeping townlet,
and the South-Avon was gurgling through the wooden piles of the bridge, Sir John died there
in the arms of his wife.  She concealed nothing of the cause of her husband's death save the
subject of the quarrel, which she felt it would be premature to announce just then, and until
proof of her status should be forthcoming.  But before a month had passed, it happened, to
her inexpressible sorrow, that the child of this clandestine union fell sick and died.  From
that hour all interest in the name and fame of the Horseleighs forsook the younger of the twain
who called themselves wives of Sir John, and, being careless about her own fame, she took no
steps to assert her claims, her legal position having, indeed, grown hateful to her in her
horror at the tragedy.  And Sir William Byrt, the curate who had married her to her husband,
being an old man and feeble, was not disinclined to leave the embers unstirred of such a fiery
matter as this, and to assist her in letting established things stand.  Therefore, Edith retired
with the nurse, her only companion and friend, to her native town, where she lived in absolute
obscurity till her death in middle age.  Her brother was never seen again in England.

A strangely corroborative sequel to the story remains to be told.  Shortly after the death
of Sir John Horseleigh, a soldier of fortune returned from the Continent, called on Dame Horseleigh
the fictitious, living in widowed state at Clyfton Horseleigh, and, after a singularly brief
courtship, married her.  The tradition at Havenpool and elsewhere has ever been that this man
was already her husband, Decimus Strong, who remarried her for appearance' sake only.

The illegitimate son of this lady by Sir John succeeded to the estates and honours, and his
son after him, there being nobody on the alert to investigate their pretensions.  Little difference
would it have made to the present generation, however, had there been such a one, for the family
in all its branches, lawful and unlawful, has been extinct these many score years, the last
representative but one being killed at the siege of Sherton Castle, while attacking in the
service of the Parliament, and the other being outlawed later in the same century for a debt
of ten pounds, and dying in the county jail.  The mansion house and its appurtenances were,
as I have previously stated, destroyed, excepting one small wing, which now forms part of a
farmhouse, and is visible as you pass along the railway from Casterbridge to Ivel.  The outline
of the old bowling-green is also distinctly to be seen.

This, then, is the reason why the only lawful marriage of Sir John, as recorded in the obscure
register at Havenpool, does not appear in the pedigree of the house of Horseleigh.

Spring 1893.

THE DUKE'S REAPPEARANCE--A FAMILY TRADITION

According to the kinsman who told me the story, Christopher Swetman's house, on the outskirts
of King's-Hintock village, was in those days larger and better kept than when, many years later,
it was sold to the lord of the manor adjoining; after having been in the Swetman family, as
one may say, since the Conquest.

Some people would have it to be that the thing happened at the house opposite, belonging to
one Childs, with whose family the Swetmans afterwards intermarried.  But that it was at the
original homestead of the Swetmans can be shown in various ways; chiefly by the unbroken traditions
of the family, and indirectly by the evidence of the walls themselves, which are the only ones
thereabout with windows mullioned in the Elizabethan manner, and plainly of a date anterior
to the event; while those of the other house might well have been erected fifty or eighty years
later, and probably were; since the choice of Swetman's house by the fugitive was doubtless
dictated by no other circumstance than its then suitable loneliness.

It was a cloudy July morning just before dawn, the hour of two having been struck by Swetman's
one-handed clock on the stairs, that is still preserved in the family.  Christopher heard the
strokes from his chamber, immediately at the top of the staircase, and overlooking the front
of the house.  He did not wonder that he was sleepless.  The rumours and excitements which
had latterly stirred the neighbourhood, to the effect that the rightful King of England had
landed from Holland, at a port only eighteen miles to the south-west of Swetman's house, were
enough to make wakeful and anxious even a contented yeoman like him.  Some of the villagers,
intoxicated by the news, had thrown down their scythes, and rushed to the ranks of the invader.
Christopher Swetman had weighed both sides of the question, and had remained at home.

Now as he lay thinking of these and other things he fancied that he could hear the footfall
of a man on the road leading up to his house--a byway, which led scarce anywhere else; and
therefore a tread was at any time more apt to startle the inmates of the homestead than if
it had stood in a thoroughfare.  The footfall came opposite the gate, and stopped there. One
minute, two minutes passed, and the pedestrian did not proceed. Christopher Swetman got out
of bed, and opened the casement.  'Hoi! who's there?' cries he.

'A friend,' came from the darkness.

'And what mid ye want at this time o' night?' says Swetman.

'Shelter.  I've lost my way.'

'What's thy name?'

There came no answer.

'Be ye one of King Monmouth's men?'

'He that asks no questions will hear no lies from me.  I am a stranger; and I am spent, and
hungered.  Can you let me lie with you to-night?'

Swetman was generous to people in trouble, and his house was roomy.  'Wait a bit,' he said,
'and I'll come down and have a look at thee, anyhow.'

He struck a light, put on his clothes, and descended, taking his horn- lantern from a nail
in the passage, and lighting it before opening the door.  The rays fell on the form of a tall,
dark man in cavalry accoutrements and wearing a sword.  He was pale with fatigue and covered
with mud, though the weather was dry.

'Prithee take no heed of my appearance,' said the stranger.  'But let me in.'

That his visitor was in sore distress admitted of no doubt, and the yeoman's natural humanity
assisted the other's sad importunity and gentle voice.  Swetman took him in, not without a
suspicion that this man represented in some way Monmouth's cause, to which he was not unfriendly
in his secret heart.  At his earnest request the new-comer was given a suit of the yeoman's
old clothes in exchange for his own, which, with his sword, were hidden in a closet in Swetman's
chamber; food was then put before him and a lodging provided for him in a room at the back.

Here he slept till quite late in the morning, which was Sunday, the sixth of July, and when
he came down in the garments that he had borrowed he met the household with a melancholy smile.
Besides Swetman himself, there were only his two daughters, Grace and Leonard (the latter was,
oddly enough, a woman's name here), and both had been enjoined to secrecy.  They asked no questions
and received no information; though the stranger regarded their fair countenances with an interest
almost too deep.  Having partaken of their usual breakfast of ham and cider he professed weariness
and retired to the chamber whence he had come.

In a couple of hours or thereabout he came down again, the two young women having now gone
off to morning service.  Seeing Christopher bustling about the house without assistance, he
asked if he could do anything to aid his host.

As he seemed anxious to hide all differences and appear as one of themselves, Swetman set him
to get vegetables from the garden and fetch water from Buttock's Spring in the dip near the
house (though the spring was not called by that name till years after, by the way).

'And what can I do next?' says the stranger when these services had been performed.

His meekness and docility struck Christopher much, and won upon him. 'Since you be minded to,'
says the latter, 'you can take down the dishes and spread the table for dinner.  Take a pewter
plate for thyself, but the trenchers will do for we.'

But the other would not, and took a trencher likewise, in doing which he spoke of the two girls
and remarked how comely they were.

This quietude was put an end to by a stir out of doors, which was sufficient to draw Swetman's
attention to it, and he went out.  Farm hands who had gone off and joined the Duke on his arrival
had begun to come in with news that a midnight battle had been fought on the moors to the north,
the Duke's men, who had attacked, being entirely worsted; the Duke himself, with one or two
lords and other friends, had fled, no one knew whither.

'There has been a battle,' says Swetman, on coming indoors after these tidings, and looking
earnestly at the stranger.

'May the victory be to the rightful in the end, whatever the issue now,' says the other, with
a sorrowful sigh.

'Dost really know nothing about it?' said Christopher.  'I could have sworn you was one from
that very battle!'

'I was here before three o' the clock this morning; and these men have only arrived now.'

'True,' said the yeoman.  'But still, I think--'

'Do not press your question,' the stranger urged.  'I am in a strait, and can refuse a helper
nothing; such inquiry is, therefore, unfair.'

'True again,' said Swetman, and held his tongue.

The daughters of the house returned from church, where the service had been hurried by reason
of the excitement.  To their father's questioning if they had spoken of him who sojourned there
they replied that they had said never a word; which, indeed, was true, as events proved.

He bade them serve the dinner; and, as the visitor had withdrawn since the news of the battle,
prepared to take a platter to him upstairs.  But he preferred to come down and dine with the
family.

During the afternoon more fugitives passed through the village, but Christopher Swetman, his
visitor, and his family kept indoors.  In the evening, however, Swetman came out from his gate,
and, harkening in silence to these tidings and more, wondered what might be in store for him
for his last night's work.

He returned homeward by a path across the mead that skirted his own orchard.  Passing here,
he heard the voice of his daughter Leonard expostulating inside the hedge, her words being:
'Don't ye, sir; don't!  I prithee let me go!'

'Why, sweetheart?'

'Because I've a-promised another!'

Peeping through, as he could not help doing, he saw the girl struggling in the arms of the
stranger, who was attempting to kiss her; but finding her resistance to be genuine, and her
distress unfeigned, he reluctantly let her go.

Swetman's face grew dark, for his girls were more to him than himself.  He hastened on, meditating
moodily all the way.  He entered the gate, and made straight for the orchard.  When he reached
it his daughter had disappeared, but the stranger was still standing there.

'Sir!' said the yeoman, his anger having in no wise abated, 'I've seen what has happened! 
I have taken 'ee into my house, at some jeopardy to myself; and, whoever you be, the least
I expected of 'ee was to treat the maidens with a seemly respect.  You have not done it, and
I no longer trust you.  I am the more watchful over them in that they are motherless; and I
must ask 'ee to go after dark this night!'

The stranger seemed dazed at discovering what his impulse had brought down upon his head, and
his pale face grew paler.  He did not reply for a time.  When he did speak his soft voice was
thick with feeling.

'Sir,' says he, 'I own that I am in the wrong, if you take the matter gravely.  We do not what
we would but what we must.  Though I have not injured your daughter as a woman, I have been
treacherous to her as a hostess and friend in need.  I'll go, as you say; I can do no less.
I shall doubtless find a refuge elsewhere.'

They walked towards the house in silence, where Swetman insisted that his guest should have
supper before departing.  By the time this was eaten it was dusk and the stranger announced
that he was ready.

They went upstairs to where the garments and sword lay hidden, till the departing one said
that on further thought he would ask another favour: that he should be allowed to retain the
clothes he wore, and that his host would keep the others and the sword till he, the speaker,
should come or send for them.

'As you will,' said Swetman.  'The gain is on my side; for those clouts were but kept to dress
a scarecrow next fall.'

'They suit my case,' said the stranger sadly.  'However much they may misfit me, they do not
misfit my sorry fortune now!'

'Nay, then,' said Christopher relenting, 'I was too hasty.  Sh'lt bide!'

But the other would not, saying that it was better that things should take their course.  Notwithstanding
that Swetman importuned him, he only added, 'If I never come again, do with my belongings as
you list.  In the pocket you will find a gold snuff-box, and in the snuff-box fifty gold pieces.'

'But keep 'em for thy use, man!' said the yeoman.

'No,' says the parting guest; 'they are foreign pieces and would harm me if I were taken. 
Do as I bid thee.  Put away these things again and take especial charge of the sword.  It belonged
to my father's father and I value it much.  But something more common becomes me now.'

Saying which, he took, as he went downstairs, one of the ash sticks used by Swetman himself
for walking with.  The yeoman lighted him out to the garden hatch, where he disappeared through
Clammers Gate by the road that crosses King's-Hintock Park to Evershead.

Christopher returned to the upstairs chamber, and sat down on his bed reflecting.  Then he
examined the things left behind, and surely enough in one of the pockets the gold snuff-box
was revealed, containing the fifty gold pieces as stated by the fugitive.  The yeoman next
looked at the sword which its owner had stated to have belonged to his grandfather. It was
two-edged, so that he almost feared to handle it.  On the blade was inscribed the words 'ANDREA
FERARA,' and among the many fine chasings were a rose and crown, the plume of the Prince of
Wales, and two portraits; portraits of a man and a woman, the man's having the face of the
first King Charles, and the woman's, apparently, that of his Queen.

Swetman, much awed and surprised, returned the articles to the closet, and went downstairs
pondering.  Of his surmise he said nothing to his daughters, merely declaring to them that
the gentleman was gone; and never revealing that he had been an eye-witness of the unpleasant
scene in the orchard that was the immediate cause of the departure.

Nothing occurred in Hintock during the week that followed, beyond the fitful arrival of more
decided tidings concerning the utter defeat of the Duke's army and his own disappearance at
an early stage of the battle. Then it was told that Monmouth was taken, not in his own clothes
but in the disguise of a countryman.  He had been sent to London, and was confined in the Tower.

The possibility that his guest had been no other than the Duke made Swetman unspeakably sorry
now; his heart smote him at the thought that, acting so harshly for such a small breach of
good faith, he might have been the means of forwarding the unhappy fugitive's capture.  On
the girls coming up to him he said, 'Get away with ye, wenches: I fear you have been the ruin
of an unfortunate man!'

On the Tuesday night following, when the yeoman was sleeping as usual in his chamber, he was,
he said, conscious of the entry of some one.  Opening his eyes, he beheld by the light of the
moon, which shone upon the front of his house, the figure of a man who seemed to be the stranger
moving from the door towards the closet.  He was dressed somewhat differently now, but the
face was quite that of his late guest in its tragical pensiveness, as was also the tallness
of his figure.  He neared the closet; and, feeling his visitor to be within his rights, Christopher
refrained from stirring.  The personage turned his large haggard eyes upon the bed where Swetman
lay, and then withdrew from their hiding the articles that belonged to him, again giving a
hard gaze at Christopher as he went noiselessly out of the chamber with his properties on his
arm. I. p. 243.

'Then we shan't see anything more of you on the mainland?' inquired the schoolmaster.

'O, I don't know about that,' said Miss Trewthen.

'Here endeth the career of the belle of the boarding-school your father was foolish enough
to send you to.  A "general merchant's" wife in the Lyonesse Isles.  Will you sell pounds of
soap and pennyworths of tin tacks, or whole bars of saponaceous matter, and great tenpenny nails?'

'He's not in such a small way as that!' she almost pleaded.  'He owns ships, though they are
rather little ones!'

'O, well, it is much the same.  Come, let us walk on; it is tedious to stand still.  I thought
you would be a failure in education,' he continued, when she obeyed him and strolled ahead.
'You never showed power that way.  You remind me much of some of those women who think they
are sure to be great actresses if they go on the stage, because they have a pretty face, and
forget that what we require is acting.  But you found your mistake, didn't you?'

'Don't taunt me, Charles.'  It was noticeable that the young schoolmaster's tone caused her
no anger or retaliatory passion; far otherwise: there was a tear in her eye.  'How is it you
are at Pen-zephyr?' she inquired.

'I don't taunt you.  I speak the truth, purely in a friendly way, as I should to any one I
wished well.  Though for that matter I might have some excuse even for taunting you.  Such
a terrible hurry as you've been in.  I hate a woman who is in such a hurry.'

'How do you mean that?'

'Why--to be somebody's wife or other--anything's wife rather than nobody's.  You couldn't wait
for me, O, no.  Well, thank God, I'm cured of all that!'

'How merciless you are!' she said bitterly.  'Wait for you?  What does that mean, Charley?
You never showed--anything to wait for--anything special towards me.'

'O come, Baptista dear; come!'

'What I mean is, nothing definite,' she expostulated.  'I suppose you liked me a little; but
it seemed to me to be only a pastime on your part, and that you never meant to make an honourable
engagement of it.'

'There, that's just it!  You girls expect a man to mean business at the first look.  No man
when he first becomes interested in a woman has any definite scheme of engagement to marry
her in his mind, unless he is meaning a vulgar mercenary marriage.  However, I did at last
mean an honourable engagement, as you call it, come to that.'

'But you never said so, and an indefinite courtship soon injures a woman's position and credit,
sooner than you think.'

'Baptista, I solemnly declare that in six months I should have asked you to marry me.'

She walked along in silence, looking on the ground, and appearing very uncomfortable.  Presently
he said, 'Would you have waited for me if you had known?'  To this she whispered in a sorrowful
whisper, 'Yes!'

They went still farther in silence--passing along one of the beautiful walks on the outskirts
of the town, yet not observant of scene or situation.  Her shoulder and his were close together,
and he clasped his fingers round the small of her arm--quite lightly, and without any attempt
at impetus; yet the act seemed to say, 'Now I hold you, and my will must be yours.'

Recurring to a previous question of hers he said, 'I have merely run down here for a day or
two from school near Trufal, before going off to the north for the rest of my holiday.  I have
seen my relations at Redrutin quite lately, so I am not going there this time.  How little
I thought of meeting you!  How very different the circumstances would have been if, instead
of parting again as we must in half-an-hour or so, possibly for ever, you had been now just
going off with me, as my wife, on our honeymoon trip.  Ha--ha--well--so humorous is life!'

She stopped suddenly.  'I must go back now--this is altogether too painful, Charley!  It is
not at all a kind mood you are in to-day.'

'I don't want to pain you--you know I do not,' he said more gently.  'Only it just exasperates
me--this you are going to do.  I wish you would not.'

'What?'

'Marry him.  There, now I have showed you my true sentiments.'

'I must do it now,' said she.

'Why?' he asked, dropping the off-hand masterful tone he had hitherto spoken in, and becoming
earnest; still holding her arm, however, as if she were his chattel to be taken up or put down
at will.  'It is never too late to break off a marriage that's distasteful to you.  Now I'll
say one thing; and it is truth: I wish you would marry me instead of him, even now, at the
last moment, though you have served me so badly.'

'O, it is not possible to think of that!' she answered hastily, shaking her head.  'When I
get home all will be prepared--it is ready even now--the things for the party, the furniture,
Mr. Heddegan's new suit, and everything.  I should require the courage of a tropical lion to
go home there and say I wouldn't carry out my promise!'

'Then go, in Heaven's name!  But there would be no necessity for you to go home and face them
in that way.  If we were to marry, it would have to be at once, instantly; or not at all. 
I should think your affection not worth the having unless you agreed to come back with me to
Trufal this evening, where we could be married by licence on Monday morning.  And then no Mr.
David Heddegan or anybody else could get you away from me.'

'I must go home by the Tuesday boat,' she faltered.  'What would they think if I did not come?'

'You could go home by that boat just the same.  All the difference would be that I should go
with you.  You could leave me on the quay, where I'd have a smoke, while you went and saw your
father and mother privately; you could then tell them what you had done, and that I was waiting
not far off; that I was a school-master in a fairly good position, and a young man you had
known when you were at the Training College.  Then I would come boldly forward; and they would
see that it could not be altered, and so you wouldn't suffer a lifelong misery by being the
wife of a wretched old gaffer you don't like at all.  Now, honestly; you do like me best, don't
you, Baptista?'

'Yes.'

'Then we will do as I say.'

She did not pronounce a clear affirmative.  But that she consented to the novel proposition
at some moment or other of that walk was apparent by what occurred a little later.

CHAPTER III

An enterprise of such pith required, indeed, less talking than consideration.  The first thing
they did in carrying it out was to return to the railway station, where Baptista took from
her luggage a small trunk of immediate necessaries which she would in any case have required
after missing the boat.  That same afternoon they travelled up the line to Trufal.

Charles Stow (as his name was), despite his disdainful indifference to things, was very careful
of appearances, and made the journey independently of her though in the same train.  He told
her where she could get board and lodgings in the city; and with merely a distant nod to her
of a provisional kind, went off to his own quarters, and to see about the licence.

On Sunday she saw him in the morning across the nave of the pro-cathedral.  In the afternoon
they walked together in the fields, where he told her that the licence would be ready next
day, and would be available the day after, when the ceremony could be performed as early after
eight o'clock as they should choose.

His courtship, thus renewed after an interval of two years, was as impetuous, violent even,
as it was short.  The next day came and passed, and the final arrangements were made.  Their
agreement was to get the ceremony over as soon as they possibly could the next morning, so
as to go on to Pen-zephyr at once, and reach that place in time for the boat's departure the
same day.  It was in obedience to Baptista's earnest request that Stow consented thus to make
the whole journey to Lyonesse by land and water at one heat, and not break it at Pen-zephyr;
she seemed to be oppressed with a dread of lingering anywhere, this great first act of disobedience
to her parents once accomplished, with the weight on her mind that her home had to be convulsed
by the disclosure of it.  To face her difficulties over the water immediately she had created
them was, however, a course more desired by Baptista than by her lover; though for once he
gave way.

The next morning was bright and warm as those which had preceded it.  By six o'clock it seemed
nearly noon, as is often the case in that part of England in the summer season.  By nine they
were husband and wife.  They packed up and departed by the earliest train after the service;
and on the way discussed at length what she should say on meeting her parents, Charley dictating
the turn of each phrase.  In her anxiety they had travelled so early that when they reached
Pen-zephyr they found there were nearly two hours on their hands before the steamer's time
of sailing.

Baptista was extremely reluctant to be seen promenading the streets of the watering-place with
her husband till, as above stated, the household at Giant's Town should know the unexpected
course of events from her own lips; and it was just possible, if not likely, that some Lyonessian
might be prowling about there, or even have come across the sea to look for her.  To meet any
one to whom she was known, and to have to reply to awkward questions about the strange young
man at her side before her well- framed announcement had been delivered at proper time and
place, was a thing she could not contemplate with equanimity.  So, instead of looking at the
shops and harbour, they went along the coast a little way.

The heat of the morning was by this time intense.  They clambered up on some cliffs, and while
sitting there, looking around at St. Michael's Mount and other objects, Charles said to her
that he thought he would run down to the beach at their feet, and take just one plunge into
the sea.

Baptista did not much like the idea of being left alone; it was gloomy, she said.  But he assured
her he would not be gone more than a quarter of an hour at the outside, and she passively assented.

Down he went, disappeared, appeared again, and looked back.  Then he again proceeded, and vanished,
till, as a small waxen object, she saw him emerge from the nook that had screened him, cross
the white fringe of foam, and walk into the undulating mass of blue.  Once in the water he
seemed less inclined to hurry than before; he remained a long time; and, unable either to appreciate
his skill or criticize his want of it at that distance, she withdrew her eyes from the spot,
and gazed at the still outline of St. Michael's--now beautifully toned in grey.

Her anxiety for the hour of departure, and to cope at once with the approaching incidents that
she would have to manipulate as best she could, sent her into a reverie.  It was now Tuesday;
she would reach home in the evening--a very late time they would say; but, as the delay was
a pure accident, they would deem her marriage to Mr. Heddegan to-morrow still practicable.
Then Charles would have to be produced from the background.  It was a terrible undertaking
to think of, and she almost regretted her temerity in wedding so hastily that morning.  The
rage of her father would be so crushing; the reproaches of her mother so bitter; and perhaps
Charles would answer hotly, and perhaps cause estrangement till death.  There had obviously
been no alarm about her at St. Maria's, or somebody would have sailed across to inquire for
her.  She had, in a letter written at the beginning of the week, spoken of the hour at which
she intended to leave her country schoolhouse; and from this her friends had probably perceived
that by such timing she would run a risk of losing the Saturday boat.  She had missed it, and
as a consequence sat here on the shore as Mrs. Charles Stow.

This brought her to the present, and she turned from the outline of St. Michael's Mount to
look about for her husband's form.  He was, as far as she could discover, no longer in the
sea.  Then he was dressing.  By moving a few steps she could see where his clothes lay.  But
Charles was not beside them.

Baptista looked back again at the water in bewilderment, as if her senses were the victim of
some sleight of hand.  Not a speck or spot resembling a man's head or face showed anywhere.
By this time she was alarmed, and her alarm intensified when she perceived a little beyond
the scene of her husband's bathing a small area of water, the quality of whose surface differed
from that of the surrounding expanse as the coarse vegetation of some foul patch in a mead
differs from the fine green of the remainder. Elsewhere it looked flexuous, here it looked
vermiculated and lumpy, and her marine experiences suggested to her in a moment that two currents
met and caused a turmoil at this place.

She descended as hastily as her trembling limbs would allow.  The way down was terribly long,
and before reaching the heap of clothes it occurred to her that, after all, it would be best
to run first for help. Hastening along in a lateral direction she proceeded inland till she
met a man, and soon afterwards two others.  To them she exclaimed, 'I think a gentleman who
was bathing is in some danger.  I cannot see him as I could.  Will you please run and help
him, at once, if you will be so kind?'

She did not think of turning to show them the exact spot, indicating it vaguely by the direction
of her hand, and still going on her way with the idea of gaining more assistance.  When she
deemed, in her faintness, that she had carried the alarm far enough, she faced about and dragged
herself back again.  Before reaching the now dreaded spot she met one of the men.

'We can see nothing at all, Miss,' he declared.

Having gained the beach, she found the tide in, and no sign of Charley's clothes.  The other
men whom she had besought to come had disappeared, it must have been in some other direction,
for she had not met them going away.  They, finding nothing, had probably thought her alarm
a mere conjecture, and given up the quest.

Baptista sank down upon the stones near at hand.  Where Charley had undressed was now sea.
There could not be the least doubt that he was drowned, and his body sucked under by the current;
while his clothes, lying within high-water mark, had probably been carried away by the rising tide.

She remained in a stupor for some minutes, till a strange sensation succeeded the aforesaid
perceptions, mystifying her intelligence, and leaving her physically almost inert.  With his
personal disappearance, the last three days of her life with him seemed to be swallowed up,
also his image, in her mind's eye, waned curiously, receded far away, grew stranger and stranger,
less and less real.  Their meeting and marriage had been so sudden, unpremeditated, adventurous,
that she could hardly believe that she had played her part in such a reckless drama.  Of all
the few hours of her life with Charles, the portion that most insisted in coming back to memory
was their fortuitous encounter on the previous Saturday, and those bitter reprimands with which
he had begun the attack, as it might be called, which had piqued her to an unexpected consummation.

A sort of cruelty, an imperiousness, even in his warmth, had characterized Charles Stow.  As
a lover he had ever been a bit of a tyrant; and it might pretty truly have been said that he
had stung her into marriage with him at last.  Still more alien from her life did these reflections
operate to make him; and then they would be chased away by an interval of passionate weeping
and mad regret.  Finally, there returned upon the confused mind of the young wife the recollection
that she was on her way homeward, and that the packet would sail in three-quarters of an hour.

Except the parasol in her hand, all she possessed was at the station awaiting her onward journey.

She looked in that direction; and, entering one of those undemonstrative phases so common with
her, walked quietly on.

At first she made straight for the railway; but suddenly turning she went to a shop and wrote
an anonymous line announcing his death by drowning to the only person she had ever heard Charles
mention as a relative.  Posting this stealthily, and with a fearful look around her, she seemed
to acquire a terror of the late events, pursuing her way to the station as if followed by a
spectre.

When she got to the office she asked for the luggage that she had left there on the Saturday
as well as the trunk left on the morning just lapsed.  All were put in the boat, and she herself
followed.  Quickly as these things had been done, the whole proceeding, nevertheless, had been
almost automatic on Baptista's part, ere she had come to any definite conclusion on her course.

Just before the bell rang she heard a conversation on the pier, which removed the last shade
of doubt from her mind, if any had existed, that she was Charles Stow's widow.  The sentences
were but fragmentary, but she could easily piece them out.

'A man drowned--swam out too far--was a stranger to the place--people in boat--saw him go down--couldn't
get there in time.'

The news was little more definite than this as yet; though it may as well be stated once for
all that the statement was true.  Charley, with the over-confidence of his nature, had ventured
out too far for his strength, and succumbed in the absence of assistance, his lifeless body
being at that moment suspended in the transparent mid-depths of the bay.  His clothes, however,
had merely been gently lifted by the rising tide, and floated into a nook hard by, where they
lay out of sight of the passers- by till a day or two after.

CHAPTER IV

In ten minutes they were steaming out of the harbour for their voyage of four or five hours,
at whose ending she would have to tell her strange story.

As Pen-zephyr and all its environing scenes disappeared behind Mousehole and St. Clement's
Isle, Baptista's ephemeral, meteor-like husband impressed her yet more as a fantasy.  She was
still in such a trance-like state that she had been an hour on the little packet-boat before
she became aware of the agitating fact that Mr. Heddegan was on board with her.  Involuntarily
she slipped from her left hand the symbol of her wifehood.

'Hee-hee!  Well, the truth is, I wouldn't interrupt 'ee.  "I reckon she don't see me, or won't
see me," I said, "and what's the hurry?  She'll see enough o' me soon!"  I hope ye be well,
mee deer?'

He was a hale, well-conditioned man of about five and fifty, of the complexion common to those
whose lives are passed on the bluffs and beaches of an ocean isle.  He extended the four quarters
of his face in a genial smile, and his hand for a grasp of the same magnitude.  She gave her
own in surprised docility, and he continued: 'I couldn't help coming across to meet 'ee.  What
an unfortunate thing you missing the boat and not coming Saturday!  They meant to have warned
'ee that the time was changed, but forgot it at the last moment.  The truth is that I should
have informed 'ee myself; but I was that busy finishing up a job last week, so as to have this
week free, that I trusted to your father for attending to these little things.  However, so
plain and quiet as it is all to be, it really do not matter so much as it might otherwise have
done, and I hope ye haven't been greatly put out.  Now, if you'd sooner that I should not be
seen talking to 'ee--if 'ee feel shy at all before strangers--just say.  I'll leave 'ee to
yourself till we get home.'

'Thank you much.  I am indeed a little tired, Mr. Heddegan.'

He nodded urbane acquiescence, strolled away immediately, and minutely inspected the surface
of the funnel, till some female passengers of Giant's Town tittered at what they must have
thought a rebuff--for the approaching wedding was known to many on St. Maria's Island, though
to nobody elsewhere.  Baptista coloured at their satire, and called him back, and forced herself
to commune with him in at least a mechanically friendly manner.

The opening event had been thus different from her expectation, and she had adumbrated no act
to meet it.  Taken aback she passively allowed circumstances to pilot her along; and so the
voyage was made.

It was near dusk when they touched the pier of Giant's Town, where several friends and neighbours
stood awaiting them.  Her father had a lantern in his hand.  Her mother, too, was there, reproachfully
glad that the delay had at last ended so simply.  Mrs. Trewthen and her daughter went together
along the Giant's Walk, or promenade, to the house, rather in advance of her husband and Mr.
Heddegan, who talked in loud tones which reached the women over their shoulders.

Some would have called Mrs. Trewthen a good mother; but though well meaning she was maladroit,
and her intentions missed their mark.  This might have been partly attributable to the slight
deafness from which she suffered.  Now, as usual, the chief utterances came from her lips.

'Ah, yes, I'm so glad, my child, that you've got over safe.  It is all ready, and everything
so well arranged, that nothing but misfortune could hinder you settling as, with God's grace,
becomes 'ee.  Close to your mother's door a'most, 'twill be a great blessing, I'm sure; and
I was very glad to find from your letters that you'd held your word sacred. That's right--make
your word your bond always.  Mrs. Wace seems to be a sensible woman.  I hope the Lord will
do for her as he's doing for you no long time hence.  And how did 'ee get over the terrible
journey from Tor- upon-Sea to Pen-zephyr?  Once you'd done with the railway, of course, you
seemed quite at home.  Well, Baptista, conduct yourself seemly, and all will be well.'

Thus admonished, Baptista entered the house, her father and Mr. Heddegan immediately at her
back.  Her mother had been so didactic that she had felt herself absolutely unable to broach
the subjects in the centre of her mind.

The familiar room, with the dark ceiling, the well-spread table, the old chairs, had never
before spoken so eloquently of the times ere she knew or had heard of Charley Stow.  She went
upstairs to take off her things, her mother remaining below to complete the disposition of
the supper, and attend to the preparation of to-morrow's meal, altogether composing such an
array of pies, from pies of fish to pies of turnips, as was never heard of outside the Western
Duchy.  Baptista, once alone, sat down and did nothing; and was called before she had taken
off her bonnet.

'I'm coming,' she cried, jumping up, and speedily disapparelling herself, brushed her hair
with a few touches and went down.

Two or three of Mr. Heddegan's and her father's friends had dropped in, and expressed their
sympathy for the delay she had been subjected to.  The meal was a most merry one except to
Baptista.  She had desired privacy, and there was none; and to break the news was already a
greater difficulty than it had been at first.  Everything around her, animate and inanimate,
great and small, insisted that she had come home to be married; and she could not get a chance
to say nay.

One or two people sang songs, as overtures to the melody of the morrow, till at length bedtime
came, and they all withdrew, her mother having retired a little earlier.  When Baptista found
herself again alone in her bedroom the case stood as before: she had come home with much to
say, and she had said nothing.

It was now growing clear even to herself that Charles being dead, she had not determination
sufficient within her to break tidings which, had he been alive, would have imperatively announced
themselves.  And thus with the stroke of midnight came the turning of the scale; her story
should remain untold.  It was not that upon the whole she thought it best not to attempt to
tell it; but that she could not undertake so explosive a matter.  To stop the wedding now would
cause a convulsion in Giant's Town little short of volcanic.  Weakened, tired, and terrified
as she had been by the day's adventures, she could not make herself the author of such a catastrophe.
But how refuse Heddegan without telling?  It really seemed to her as if her marriage with Mr.
Heddegan were about to take place as if nothing had intervened.

Morning came.  The events of the previous days were cut off from her present existence by scene
and sentiment more completely than ever. Charles Stow had grown to be a special being of whom,
owing to his character, she entertained rather fearful than loving memory.  Baptista could
hear when she awoke that her parents were already moving about downstairs.  But she did not
rise till her mother's rather rough voice resounded up the staircase as it had done on the
preceding evening.

'Baptista!  Come, time to be stirring!  The man will be here, by heaven's blessing, in three-quarters
of an hour.  He has looked in already for a minute or two--and says he's going to the church
to see if things be well forward.'

Baptista arose, looked out of the window, and took the easy course.  When she emerged from
the regions above she was arrayed in her new silk frock and best stockings, wearing a linen
jacket over the former for breakfasting, and her common slippers over the latter, not to spoil
the new ones on the rough precincts of the dwelling.

It is unnecessary to dwell at any great length on this part of the morning's proceedings. 
She revealed nothing; and married Heddegan, as she had given her word to do, on that appointed
August day.

CHAPTER V

Mr. Heddegan forgave the coldness of his bride's manner during and after the wedding ceremony,
full well aware that there had been considerable reluctance on her part to acquiesce in this
neighbourly arrangement, and, as a philosopher of long standing, holding that whatever Baptista's
attitude now, the conditions would probably be much the same six months hence as those which
ruled among other married couples.

An absolutely unexpected shock was given to Baptista's listless mind about an hour after the
wedding service.  They had nearly finished the mid-day dinner when the now husband said to
her father, 'We think of starting about two.  And the breeze being so fair we shall bring up
inside Pen-zephyr new pier about six at least.'

'What--are we going to Pen-zephyr?' said Baptista.  'I don't know anything of it.'

'Didn't you tell her?' asked her father of Heddegan.

It transpired that, owing to the delay in her arrival, this proposal too, among other things,
had in the hurry not been mentioned to her, except some time ago as a general suggestion that
they would go somewhere. Heddegan had imagined that any trip would be pleasant, and one to
the mainland the pleasantest of all.

She looked so distressed at the announcement that her husband willingly offered to give it
up, though he had not had a holiday off the island for a whole year.  Then she pondered on
the inconvenience of staying at Giant's Town, where all the inhabitants were bonded, by the
circumstances of their situation, into a sort of family party, which permitted and encouraged
on such occasions as these oral criticism that was apt to disturb the equanimity of newly married
girls, and would especially worry Baptista in her strange situation.  Hence, unexpectedly,
she agreed not to disorganize her husband's plans for the wedding jaunt, and it was settled
that, as originally intended, they should proceed in a neighbour's sailing boat to the metropolis
of the district.

In this way they arrived at Pen-zephyr without difficulty or mishap. Bidding adieu to Jenkin
and his man, who had sailed them over, they strolled arm in arm off the pier, Baptista silent,
cold, and obedient. Heddegan had arranged to take her as far as Plymouth before their return,
but to go no further than where they had landed that day.  Their first business was to find
an inn; and in this they had unexpected difficulty, since for some reason or other--possibly
the fine weather--many of the nearest at hand were full of tourists and commercial travellers.
He led her on till he reached a tavern which, though comparatively unpretending, stood in as
attractive a spot as any in the town; and this, somewhat to their surprise after their previous
experience, they found apparently empty.  The considerate old man, thinking that Baptista was
educated to artistic notions, though he himself was deficient in them, had decided that it
was most desirable to have, on such an occasion as the present, an apartment with 'a good view'
(the expression being one he had often heard in use among tourists); and he therefore asked
for a favourite room on the first floor, from which a bow-window protruded, for the express
purpose of affording such an outlook.

The landlady, after some hesitation, said she was sorry that particular apartment was engaged;
the next one, however, or any other in the house, was unoccupied.

'The gentleman who has the best one will give it up to-morrow, and then you can change into
it,' she added, as Mr. Heddegan hesitated about taking the adjoining and less commanding one.

'We shall be gone to-morrow, and shan't want it,' he said.

Wishing not to lose customers, the landlady earnestly continued that since he was bent on having
the best room, perhaps the other gentleman would not object to move at once into the one they
despised, since, though nothing could be seen from the window, the room was equally large.

'Well, if he doesn't care for a view,' said Mr. Heddegan, with the air of a highly artistic
man who did.

'O no--I am sure he doesn't,' she said.  'I can promise that you shall have the room you want.
If you would not object to go for a walk for half an hour, I could have it ready, and your
things in it, and a nice tea laid in the bow-window by the time you come back?'

This proposal was deemed satisfactory by the fussy old tradesman, and they went out.  Baptista
nervously conducted him in an opposite direction to her walk of the former day in other company,
showing on her wan face, had he observed it, how much she was beginning to regret her sacrificial
step for mending matters that morning.

She took advantage of a moment when her husband's back was turned to inquire casually in a
shop if anything had been heard of the gentleman who was sucked down in the eddy while bathing.

The shopman said, 'Yes, his body has been washed ashore,' and had just handed Baptista a newspaper
on which she discerned the heading, 'A Schoolmaster drowned while bathing,' when her husband
turned to join her. She might have pursued the subject without raising suspicion; but it was
more than flesh and blood could do, and completing a small purchase almost ran out of the shop.

'What is your terrible hurry, mee deer?' said Heddegan, hastening after.

'I don't know--I don't want to stay in shops,' she gasped.

'And we won't,' he said.  'They are suffocating this weather.  Let's go back and have some tay!'

They found the much desired apartment awaiting their entry.  It was a sort of combination bed
and sitting-room, and the table was prettily spread with high tea in the bow-window, a bunch
of flowers in the midst, and a best-parlour chair on each side.  Here they shared the meal
by the ruddy light of the vanishing sun.  But though the view had been engaged, regardless
of expense, exclusively for Baptista's pleasure, she did not direct any keen attention out
of the window.  Her gaze as often fell on the floor and walls of the room as elsewhere, and
on the table as much as on either, beholding nothing at all.

But there was a change.  Opposite her seat was the door, upon which her eyes presently became
riveted like those of a little bird upon a snake. For, on a peg at the back of the door, there
hung a hat; such a hat--surely, from its peculiar make, the actual hat--that had been worn
by Charles.  Conviction grew to certainty when she saw a railway ticket sticking up from the
band.  Charles had put the ticket there--she had noticed the act.

Her teeth almost chattered; she murmured something incoherent.  Her husband jumped up and said,
'You are not well!  What is it?  What shall I get 'ee?'

'Smelling salts!' she said, quickly and desperately; 'at that chemist's shop you were in just now.'

He jumped up like the anxious old man that he was, caught up his own hat from a back table,
and without observing the other hastened out and downstairs.

Left alone she gazed and gazed at the back of the door, then spasmodically rang the bell. 
An honest-looking country maid-servant appeared in response.

'A hat!' murmured Baptista, pointing with her finger.  'It does not belong to us.'

'O yes, I'll take it away,' said the young woman with some hurry.  'It belongs to the other
gentleman.'

She spoke with a certain awkwardness, and took the hat out of the room. Baptista had recovered
her outward composure.  'The other gentleman?' she said.  'Where is the other gentleman?'

'He's in the next room, ma'am.  He removed out of this to oblige 'ee.'

'How can you say so?  I should hear him if he were there,' said Baptista, sufficiently recovered
to argue down an apparent untruth.

'He's there,' said the girl, hardily.

'Then it is strange that he makes no noise,' said Mrs. Heddegan, convicting the girl of falsity
by a look.

'He makes no noise; but it is not strange,' said the servant.

All at once a dread took possession of the bride's heart, like a cold hand laid thereon; for
it flashed upon her that there was a possibility of reconciling the girl's statement with her
own knowledge of facts.

'Why does he make no noise?' she weakly said.

The waiting-maid was silent, and looked at her questioner.  'If I tell you, ma'am, you won't
tell missis?' she whispered.

Baptista promised.

'Because he's a-lying dead!' said the girl.  'He's the schoolmaster that was drownded yesterday.'

'O!' said the bride, covering her eyes.  'Then he was in this room till just now?'

'Yes,' said the maid, thinking the young lady's agitation natural enough. 'And I told missis
that I thought she oughtn't to have done it, because I don't hold it right to keep visitors
so much in the dark where death's concerned; but she said the gentleman didn't die of anything
infectious; she was a poor, honest, innkeeper's wife, she says, who had to get her living by
making hay while the sun sheened.  And owing to the drownded gentleman being brought here,
she said, it kept so many people away that we were empty, though all the other houses were
full.  So when your good man set his mind upon the room, and she would have lost good paying
folk if he'd not had it, it wasn't to be supposed, she said, that she'd let anything stand
in the way.  Ye won't say that I've told ye, please, m'm? All the linen has been changed, and
as the inquest won't be till to-morrow, after you are gone, she thought you wouldn't know a
word of it, being strangers here.'

The returning footsteps of her husband broke off further narration. Baptista waved her hand,
for she could not speak.  The waiting-maid quickly withdrew, and Mr. Heddegan entered with
the smelling salts and other nostrums.

'Any better?' he questioned.

'I don't like the hotel,' she exclaimed, almost simultaneously.  'I can't bear it--it doesn't
suit me!'

'Is that all that's the matter?' he returned pettishly (this being the first time of his showing
such a mood).  'Upon my heart and life such trifling is trying to any man's temper, Baptista!
Sending me about from here to yond, and then when I come back saying 'ee don't like the place
that I have sunk so much money and words to get for 'ee.  'Od dang it all, 'tis enough to--But
I won't say any more at present, mee deer, though it is just too much to expect to turn out
of the house now.  We shan't get another quiet place at this time of the evening--every other
inn in the town is bustling with rackety folk of one sort and t'other, while here 'tis as quiet
as the grave--the country, I would say.  So bide still, d'ye hear, and to-morrow we shall be
out of the town altogether--as early as you like.'

The obstinacy of age had, in short, overmastered its complaisance, and the young woman said
no more.  The simple course of telling him that in the adjoining room lay a corpse which had
lately occupied their own might, it would have seemed, have been an effectual one without further
disclosure, but to allude to that subject, however it was disguised, was more than Heddegan's
young wife had strength for.  Horror broke her down. In the contingency one thing only presented
itself to her paralyzed regard--that here she was doomed to abide, in a hideous contiguity
to the dead husband and the living, and her conjecture did, in fact, bear itself out.  That
night she lay between the two men she had married--Heddegan on the one hand, and on the other
through the partition against which the bed stood, Charles Stow.

CHAPTER VI

Kindly time had withdrawn the foregoing event three days from the present of Baptista Heddegan.
It was ten o'clock in the morning; she had been ill, not in an ordinary or definite sense,
but in a state of cold stupefaction, from which it was difficult to arouse her so much as to
say a few sentences.  When questioned she had replied that she was pretty well.

Their trip, as such, had been something of a failure.  They had gone on as far as Falmouth,
but here he had given way to her entreaties to return home.  This they could not very well
do without repassing through Pen- zephyr, at which place they had now again arrived.

In the train she had seen a weekly local paper, and read there a paragraph detailing the inquest
on Charles.  It was added that the funeral was to take place at his native town of Redrutin
on Friday.

After reading this she had shown no reluctance to enter the fatal neighbourhood of the tragedy,
only stipulating that they should take their rest at a different lodging from the first; and
now comparatively braced up and calm--indeed a cooler creature altogether than when last in
the town, she said to David that she wanted to walk out for a while, as they had plenty of
time on their hands.

'To a shop as usual, I suppose, mee deer?'

'Partly for shopping,' she said.  'And it will be best for you, dear, to stay in after trotting
about so much, and have a good rest while I am gone.'

He assented; and Baptista sallied forth. Any cavalry brings he may return evidence of vice, even
without the cause, after many dotage of discovered action; the dearest-dragged are not immaculate, but
the surest-footed infallible: it is wise, be therefore, to be apparent.
  These articles were made up into
a parcel which, in spite of the saleswoman's offers, her customer said she would take with
her.  Bearing it on her arm she turned to the railway, and at the station got a ticket for
Redrutin.

Thus it appeared that, on her recovery from the paralyzed mood of the former day, while she
had resolved not to blast utterly the happiness of her present husband by revealing the history
of the departed one, she had also determined to indulge a certain odd, inconsequent, feminine
sentiment of decency, to the small extent to which it could do no harm to any person.  At Redrutin
she emerged from the railway carriage in the black attire purchased at the shop, having during
the transit made the change in the empty compartment she had chosen.  The other clothes were
now in the bandbox and parcel.  Leaving these at the cloak-room she proceeded onward, and after
a wary survey reached the side of a hill whence a view of the burial ground could be obtained.

It was now a little before two o'clock.  While Baptista waited a funeral procession ascended
the road.  Baptista hastened across, and by the time the procession entered the cemetery gates
she had unobtrusively joined it.

In addition to the schoolmaster's own relatives (not a few), the paragraph in the newspapers
of his death by drowning had drawn together many neighbours, acquaintances, and onlookers.
Among them she passed unnoticed, and with a quiet step pursued the winding path to the chapel,
and afterwards thence to the grave.  When all was over, and the relatives and idlers had withdrawn,
she stepped to the edge of the chasm.  From beneath her mantle she drew a little bunch of forget-me-nots,
and dropped them in upon the coffin.  In a few minutes she also turned and went away from the
cemetery.  By five o'clock she was again in Pen-zephyr.

'You have been a mortal long time!' said her husband, crossly.  'I allowed you an hour at most,
mee deer.'

'It occupied me longer,' said she.

'Well--I reckon it is wasting words to complain.  Hang it, ye look so tired and wisht that
I can't find heart to say what I would!'

'I am--weary and wisht, David; I am.  We can get home to-morrow for certain, I hope?'

'We can.  And please God we will!' said Mr. Heddegan heartily, as if he too were weary of his
brief honeymoon.  'I must be into business again on Monday morning at latest.'

They left by the next morning steamer, and in the afternoon took up their residence in their
own house at Giant's Town.

The hour that she reached the island it was as if a material weight had been removed from Baptista's
shoulders.  Her husband attributed the change to the influence of the local breezes after the
hot-house atmosphere of the mainland.  However that might be, settled here, a few doors from
her mother's dwelling, she recovered in no very long time much of her customary bearing, which
was never very demonstrative.  She accepted her position calmly, and faintly smiled when her
neighbours learned to call her Mrs. Heddegan, and said she seemed likely to become the leader
of fashion in Giant's Town.

Her husband was a man who had made considerably more money by trade than her father had done:
and perhaps the greater profusion of surroundings at her command than she had heretofore been
mistress of, was not without an effect upon her.  One week, two weeks, three weeks passed;
and, being pre- eminently a young woman who allowed things to drift, she did nothing whatever
either to disclose or conceal traces of her first marriage; or to learn if there existed possibilities--which
there undoubtedly did--by which that hasty contract might become revealed to those about her
at any unexpected moment.

While yet within the first month of her marriage, and on an evening just before sunset, Baptista
was standing within her garden adjoining the house, when she saw passing along the road a personage
clad in a greasy black coat and battered tall hat, which, common enough in the slums of a city,
had an odd appearance in St. Maria's.  The tramp, as he seemed to be, marked her at once--bonnetless
and unwrapped as she was her features were plainly recognizable--and with an air of friendly
surprise came and leant over the wall.

'What! don't you know me?' said he.

She had some dim recollection of his face, but said that she was not acquainted with him.

'Why, your witness to be sure, ma'am.  Don't you mind the man that was mending the church-window
when you and your intended husband walked up to be made one; and the clerk called me down from
the ladder, and I came and did my part by writing my name and occupation?'

Baptista glanced quickly around; her husband was out of earshot.  That would have been of less
importance but for the fact that the wedding witnessed by this personage had not been the wedding
with Mr. Heddegan, but the one on the day previous.

'I've had a misfortune since then, that's pulled me under,' continued her friend.  'But don't
let me damp yer wedded joy by naming the particulars. Yes, I've seen changes since; though
'tis but a short time ago--let me see, only a month next week, I think; for 'twere the first
or second day in August.'

'Yes--that's when it was,' said another man, a sailor, who had come up with a pipe in his mouth,
and felt it necessary to join in (Baptista having receded to escape further speech).  'For
that was the first time I set foot in Giant's Town; and her husband took her to him the same day.'

A dialogue then proceeded between the two men outside the wall, which Baptista could not help
hearing.

'Ay, I signed the book that made her one flesh,' repeated the decayed glazier.  'Where's her
goodman?'

'About the premises somewhere; but you don't see 'em together much,' replied the sailor in
an undertone.  'You see, he's older than she.'

'Older?  I should never have thought it from my own observation,' said the glazier.  'He was
a remarkably handsome man.'

'Handsome?  Well, there he is--we can see for ourselves.'

David Heddegan had, indeed, just shown himself at the upper end of the garden; and the glazier,
looking in bewilderment from the husband to the wife, saw the latter turn pale.

Now that decayed glazier was a far-seeing and cunning man--too far-seeing and cunning to allow
himself to thrive by simple and straightforward means--and he held his peace, till he could
read more plainly the meaning of this riddle, merely adding carelessly, 'Well--marriage do
alter a man, 'tis true.  I should never ha' knowed him!'

He then stared oddly at the disconcerted Baptista, and moving on to where he could again address
her, asked her to do him a good turn, since he once had done the same for her.  Understanding
that he meant money, she handed him some, at which he thanked her, and instantly went away.

CHAPTER VII

She had escaped exposure on this occasion; but the incident had been an awkward one, and should
have suggested to Baptista that sooner or later the secret must leak out.  As it was, she suspected
that at any rate she had not heard the last of the glazier.

In a day or two, when her husband had gone to the old town on the other side of the island,
there came a gentle tap at the door, and the worthy witness of her first marriage made his
appearance a second time.

'It took me hours to get to the bottom of the mystery--hours!' he said with a gaze of deep
confederacy which offended her pride very deeply. 'But thanks to a good intellect I've done
it.  Now, ma'am, I'm not a man to tell tales, even when a tale would be so good as this.  But
I'm going back to the mainland again, and a little assistance would be as rain on thirsty ground.'

'I helped you two days ago,' began Baptista.

'Yes--but what was that, my good lady?  Not enough to pay my passage to Pen-zephyr. "ve. 104. You

She saw that he suspected nothing, and it made her task the harder.  But on she went steadily.
'It is about something that happened before we were married,' she said.

'Indeed!'

'Not a very long time before--a short time.  And it is about a lover,' she faltered.

'I don't much mind that,' he said mildly.  'In truth, I was in hopes 'twas more.'

'In hopes!'

'Well, yes.'

This screwed her up to the necessary effort.  'I met my old sweetheart. He scorned me, chid
me, dared me, and I went and married him.  We were coming straight here to tell you all what
we had done; but he was drowned; and I thought I would say nothing about him: and I married
you, David, for the sake of peace and quietness.  I've tried to keep it from you, but have
found I cannot.  There--that's the substance of it, and you can never, never forgive me, I
am sure!'

She spoke desperately.  But the old man, instead of turning black or blue, or slaying her in
his indignation, jumped up from his chair, and began to caper around the room in quite an ecstatic
emotion.

'O, happy thing!  How well it falls out!' he exclaimed, snapping his, fingers over his head.
'Ha-ha--the knot is cut--I see a way out of my trouble--ha-ha!'  She looked at him without
uttering a sound, till, as he still continued smiling joyfully, she said, 'O--what do you mean!
Is it done to torment me?'

'No--no!  O, mee deer, your story helps me out of the most heart-aching quandary a poor man
ever found himself in!  You see, it is this--I've got a tragedy, too; and unless you had had
one to tell, I could never have seen my way to tell mine!'

'What is yours--what is it?' she asked, with altogether a new view of things.

'Well--it is a bouncer; mine is a bouncer!' said he, looking on the ground and wiping his eyes.

'Not worse than mine?'

'Well--that depends upon how you look at it.  Yours had to do with the past alone; and I don't
mind it.  You see, we've been married a month, and it don't jar upon me as it would if we'd
only been married a day or two.  Now mine refers to past, present, and future; so that--'

'Past, present, and future!' she murmured.  'It never occurred to me that you had a tragedy, too.'

'But I have!' he said, shaking his head.  'In fact, four.'

'Then tell 'em!' cried the young woman.

'I will--I will.  But be considerate, I beg 'ee, mee deer.  Well--I wasn't a bachelor when
I married 'ee, any more than you were a spinster. Just as you was a widow-woman, I was a widow-man.

'Ah!' said she, with some surprise.  'But is that all?--then we are nicely balanced,' she added,
relieved.

'No--it is not all.  There's the point.  I am not only a widower.'

'O, David!'

'I am a widower with four tragedies--that is to say, four strapping girls--the eldest taller
than you.  Don't 'ee look so struck--dumb-like! It fell out in this way.  I knew the poor woman,
their mother, in Pen- zephyr for some years; and--to cut a long story short--I privately married
her at last, just before she died.  I kept the matter secret, but it is getting known among
the people here by degrees.  I've long felt for the children--that it is my duty to have them
here, and do something for them.  I have not had courage to break it to 'ee, but I've seen
lately that it would soon come to your ears, and that hev worried me.'

'Are they educated?' said the ex-schoolmistress.

'No.  I am sorry to say they have been much neglected; in truth, they can hardly read.  And
so I thought that by marrying a young schoolmistress I should get some one in the house who
could teach 'em, and bring 'em into genteel condition, all for nothing.  You see, they are
growed up too tall to be sent to school.'

'O, mercy!' she almost moaned. As the is what had the ghost state: "alas!

Alas! apophatism has braced; more hands of-- heaven should altogether

expectation, not here two loath pieces of white lodging in this shape

To feed, of drink, and to nrem, that is being.


The next meal came round.  As they sat, Baptista would not suffer her eyes to turn towards
him.  He did not attempt to intrude upon her reserve, but every now and then looked under the
table and chuckled with satisfaction at the aspect of affairs.  'How very well matched we be!'
he said, comfortably.

Next day, when the steamer came in, Baptista saw her husband rush down to meet it; and soon
after there appeared at her door four tall, hipless, shoulderless girls, dwindling in height
and size from the eldest to the youngest, like a row of Pan pipes; at the head of them standing
Heddegan. He smiled pleasantly through the grey fringe of his whiskers and beard, and turning
to the girls said, 'Now come forrard, and shake hands properly with your stepmother.'

Thus she made their acquaintance, and he went out, leaving them together. On examination the
poor girls turned out to be not only plain-looking, which she could have forgiven, but to have
such a lamentably meagre intellectual equipment as to be hopelessly inadequate as companions.
Even the eldest, almost her own age, could only read with difficulty words of two syllables;
and taste in dress was beyond their comprehension.  In the long vista of future years she saw
nothing but dreary drudgery at her detested old trade without prospect of reward.

She went about quite despairing during the next few days--an unpromising, unfortunate mood
for a woman who had not been married six weeks.  From her parents she concealed everything.
They had been amongst the few acquaintances of Heddegan who knew nothing of his secret, and
were indignant enough when they saw such a ready-made household foisted upon their only child.
But she would not support them in their remonstrances.

'No, you don't yet know all,' she said.

Thus Baptista had sense enough to see the retributive fairness of this issue.  For some time,
whenever conversation arose between her and Heddegan, which was not often, she always said,
'I am miserable, and you know it.  Yet I don't wish things to be otherwise.'

But one day when he asked, 'How do you like 'em now?' her answer was unexpected.  'Much better
than I did,' she said, quietly.  'I may like them very much some day.'

This was the beginning of a serener season for the chastened spirit of Baptista Heddegan. 
She had, in truth, discovered, underneath the crust of uncouthness and meagre articulation
which was due to their Troglodytean existence, that her unwelcomed daughters had natures that
were unselfish almost to sublimity. His feeling near remember she had one and all similarly, counting
most school, and watering engineering as same deprivation that tranquilly there might be the obvious.

  That in humanity, as exemplified by these girls, there was
nothing to dislike, but infinitely much to pity, she learnt with the lapse of each week in
their company. She grew to like the girls of unpromising exterior, and from liking she got
to love them; till they formed an unexpected point of junction between her own and her husband's
interests, generating a sterling friendship at least, between a pair in whose existence there
had threatened to be neither friendship nor love.

October, 1885.
