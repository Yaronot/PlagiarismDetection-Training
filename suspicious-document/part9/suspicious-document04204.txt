All readers who wish to obtain a deeper insight into the theoretical basis of autosuggestion
are recommended to study Professor Baudouin's fascinating work, Suggestion and Autosuggestion.
Although in these pages there are occasional divergences from Professor Baudouin's views, his
book remains beyond question the authoritative statement on the subject; indeed it is hardly
possible without it to form an adequate idea of the scope of autosuggestion.  My own indebtedness
to it in writing this little volume is very great.

My thanks are due for innumerable kindnesses to M. Coué himself.  That he is the embodiment
of patience everyone knows who has been in contact with him.  I am also indebted to the Rev.
Ernest Charles, of Malvern Link, who, though disclaiming responsibility for some of the views
expressed here, has made many extremely valuable suggestions.

FOREWORD

The materials for this little book were collected by Mr. Brooks during a visit he paid me in
the summer of 1921.  He was, I think, the first Englishman to come to Nancy with the express
purpose of studying my method of conscious autosuggestion.  In the course of daily visits extending
over some weeks, by attending my consultations, and by private conversations with myself, he
obtained a full mastery of the method, and we threshed out a good deal of the theory on which
it rests.

The results of this study are contained in the following pages.  Mr. Brooks has skilfully seized
on the essentials and put them forward in a manner that seems to me both simple and clear.
The instructions given are amply sufficient to enable anyone to practise autosuggestion for
him or herself, without seeking the help of any other person.

It is a method which everyone should follow--the sick to obtain healing, the healthy to prevent
the coming of disease in the future. By its practice we can insure for ourselves, all our lives
long, an excellent state of health, both of the mind and the body.

COUÉ'S NANCY PRACTICE

CHAPTER I

THE CLINIC OF EMILE COUÉ

The clinic of Emile Coué, where Induced Autosuggestion is applied to the treatment of disease,
is situated in a pleasant garden attached to his house at the quiet end of the rue Jeanne d'Arc
in Nancy.  It was here that I visited him in the early summer of 1921, and had the pleasure
for the first time of witnessing one of his consultations.

We entered the garden from his house a little before nine o'clock.  In one corner was a brick
building of two stories, with its windows thrown wide to let in the air and sunshine--this
was the clinic; a few yards away was a smaller one-storied construction which served as a waiting-room.
Under the plum and cherry trees, now laden with fruit, little groups of patients were sitting
on the garden seats, chatting amicably together and enjoying the morning sunshine while others
wandered in twos and threes among the flowers and strawberry beds.  The room reserved for the
treatments was already crowded, but in spite of that eager newcomers constantly tried to gain
entrance.  The window-sills on the ground floor were beset, and a dense knot had formed in
the doorway.  Inside, the patients had first occupied the seats which surrounded the walls,
and then covered the available floor-space, sitting on camp-stools and folding-chairs.  Coué
with some difficulty found me a seat, and the treatment immediately began.

The first patient he addressed was a frail, middle-aged man who, accompanied by his daughter,
had just arrived from Paris to consult him.  The man was a bad case of nervous trouble.  He
walked with difficulty, and his head, arms and legs were afflicted with a continual tremor.
He explained that if he encountered a stranger when walking in the street the idea that the
latter would remark his infirmity completely paralysed him, and he had to cling to whatever
support was at hand to save himself from falling.  At Coué's invitation he rose from his seat
and took a few steps across the floor.  He walked slowly, leaning on a stick; his knees were
half bent, and his feet dragged heavily along the ground.

Coué encouraged him with the promise of improvement.  "You have been sowing bad seed in your
Unconscious; now you will sow good seed.  The power by which you have produced these ill effects
will in future produce equally good ones."

The next patient was an excitable, over-worked woman of the artisan class.  When Coué inquired
the nature of her trouble, she broke into a flood of complaint, describing each symptom with
a voluble minuteness. "Madame," he interrupted, "you think too much about your ailments, and
in thinking of them you create fresh ones."

Next came a girl with headaches, a youth with inflamed eyes, and a farm-labourer incapacitated
by varicose veins.  In each case Coué stated that autosuggestion should bring complete relief.
Then it was the turn of a business man who complained of nervousness, lack of self-confidence
and haunting fears.

"When you know the method," said Coué, "you will not allow yourself to harbour such ideas."

"I work terribly hard to get rid of them," the patient answered.

"You fatigue yourself.  The greater the efforts you make, the more the ideas return.  You will
change all that easily, simply, and above all, without effort."

"I want to," the man interjected.

"That's just where you're wrong," Coué told him.  "If you say 'I want to do something,' your
imagination replies 'Oh, but you can't.'  You must say 'I am going to do it,' and if it is
in the region of the possible you will succeed."

A little further on was another neurasthenic--a girl.  This was her third visit to the clinic,
and for ten days she had been practising the method at home.  With a happy smile, and a little
pardonable self-importance, she declared that she already felt a considerable improvement.
She had more energy, was beginning to enjoy life, ate heartily and slept more soundly.  Her
sincerity and naïve delight helped to strengthen the faith of her fellow-patients.  They looked
on her as a living proof of the healing which should come to themselves.

Coué continued his questions.  Those who were unable, whether through rheumatism or some paralytic
affection, to make use of a limb were called on, as a criterion of future progress, to put
out their maximum efforts.

In addition to the visitor from Paris there were present a man and a woman who could not walk
without support, and a burly peasant, formerly a blacksmith, who for nearly ten years had not
succeeded in lifting his right arm above the level of his shoulder.  In each case Coué predicted
a complete cure.

During this preliminary stage of the treatment, the words he spoke were not in the nature of
suggestions.  They were sober expressions of opinion, based on years of experience.  Not once
did he reject the possibility of cure, though with several patients suffering from organic
disease in an advanced stage, he admitted its unlikelihood.  To these he promised, however,
a cessation of pain, an improvement of morale, and at least a retardment of the progress of
the disease. "Meanwhile," he added, "the limits of the power of autosuggestion are not yet
known; final recovery is possible."  In all cases of functional and nervous disorders, as well
as the less serious ones of an organic nature, he stated that autosuggestion, conscientiously
applied, was capable of removing the trouble completely.

It took Coué nearly forty minutes to complete his interrogation.  Other patients bore witness
to the benefits the treatment had already conferred on them.  A woman with a painful swelling
in her breast, which a doctor had diagnosed (in Coué's opinion wrongly), as of a cancerous
nature, had found complete relief after less than three weeks' treatment.  Another woman had
enriched her impoverished blood, and increased her weight by over nine pounds.  A man had been
cured of a varicose ulcer, another in a single sitting had rid himself of a lifelong habit
of stammering.  Only one of the former patients failed to report an improvement.  "Monsieur,"
said Coué, "you have been making efforts.  You must put your trust in the imagination, not
in the will. Think you are better and you will become so."

Coué now proceeded to outline the theory given in the pages which follow.  It is sufficient
here to state his main conclusions, which were these: (1) Every idea which exclusively occupies
the mind is transformed into an actual physical or mental state.  (2) The efforts we make to
conquer an idea by exerting the will only serve to make that idea more powerful.  To demonstrate
these truths he requested one of his patients, a young anaemic-looking woman, to carry out
a small experiment.  She extended her arms in front of her, and clasped the hands firmly together
with the fingers interlaced, increasing the force of her grip until a slight tremor set in.
"Look at your hands," said Coué, "and think you would like to open them but you cannot.  Now
try and pull them apart.  Pull hard.  You find that the more you try the more tightly they
become clasped together."

The girl made little convulsive movements of her wrists, really doing her best by physical
force to separate her hands, but the harder she tried the more her grip increased in strength,
until the knuckles turned white with the pressure.  Her hands seemed locked together by a force
outside her own control.

"Now think," said Cone, "'I can open my hands.'"

Slowly her grasp relaxed and, in response to a little pull, the cramped fingers came apart.
She smiled shyly at the attention she had attracted, and sat down.

Coué pointed out that the two main points of his theory were thus demonstrated simultaneously:
when the patient's mind was filled with the thought "I cannot," she could not in very fact
unclasp her hands. Further, the efforts she made to wrench them apart by exerting her will
only fixed them more firmly together.

Each patient was now called on in turn to perform the same experiment. The more imaginative
among them--notably the women--were at once successful.  One old lady was so absorbed in the
thought "I cannot" as not to heed the request to think "I can."  With her face ruefully puckered
up she sat staring fixedly at her interlocked fingers, as though contemplating an act of fate.
"Voilà," said Coué, smiling, "if Madame persists in her present idea, she will never open her
hands again as long as she lives."

Several of the men, however, were not at once successful.  The whilom blacksmith with the disabled
arm, when told to think "I should like to open my hands but I cannot," proceeded without difficulty
to open them.

"You see," said Coué, with a smile, "it depends not on what I say but on what you think.  What
were you thinking then?"

He hesitated.  "I thought perhaps I could open them after all."

"Exactly.  And therefore you could.  Now clasp your hands again.  Press them together."

When the right degree of pressure had been reached, Coué told him to repeat the words "I cannot,
I cannot...."

As he repeated this phrase the contracture increased, and all his efforts failed to release
his grip.

"Voilà," said Coué.  "Now listen.  For ten years you have been thinking you could not lift
your arm above your shoulder, consequently you have not been able to do so, for whatever we
think becomes true for us.  Now think 'I can lift it.'"

The patient looked at him doubtfully.

"Quick!" Coué said in a tone of authority.  "Think 'I can, I can!'"

"I can," said the man.  He made a half-hearted attempt and complained of a pain in his shoulder.

"Bon," said Coué.  "Don't lower your arm.  Close your eyes and repeat with me as fast as you
can, 'Ca passe, ça passe.'"

For half a minute they repeated this phrase together, speaking so fast as to produce a sound
like the whirr of a rapidly revolving machine. Meanwhile Coué quickly stroked the man's shoulder.
At the end of that time the patient admitted that his pain had left him.

"Now think well that you can lift your arm," Coué said.

The departure of the pain had given the patient faith.  His face, which before had been perplexed
and incredulous, brightened as the thought of power took possession of him.  "I can," he said
in a tone of finality, and without effort he calmly lifted his arm to its full height above
his head.  He held it there triumphantly for a moment while the whole company applauded and
encouraged him.

Coué reached for his hand and shook it.

"My friend, you are cured."

"C'est merveilleux," the man answered.  "I believe I am."

"Prove it," said Coué.  "Hit me on the shoulder."

The patient laughed, and dealt him a gentle rap.

"Harder," Coué encouraged him.  "Hit me harder--as hard as you can."

His arm began to rise and fall in regular blows, increasing in force until Coué was compelled
to call on him to stop.

"Voilà, mon ami, you can go back to your anvil."

The man resumed his seat, still hardly able to comprehend what had occurred.  Now and then
he lifted his arm as if to reassure himself, whispering to himself in an awed voice, "I can,
I can."

A little further on was seated a woman who had complained of violent neuralgia.  Under the
influence of the repeated phrase "ça passe" (it's going) the pain was dispelled in less than
thirty seconds.  Then it was the turn of the visitor from Paris.  What he had seen had inspired
him with confidence; he was sitting more erect, there was a little patch of colour in his cheeks,
and his trembling seemed less violent.

He performed the experiment with immediate success.

"Now," said Coué, "you are cultivated ground.  I can throw out the seed in handfuls."

He caused the sufferer first to stand erect with his back and knees straightened.  Then he
asked him, constantly thinking "I can," to place his entire weight on each foot in turn, slowly
performing the exercise known as "marking time."  A space was then cleared of chairs, and having
discarded his stick, the man was made to walk to and fro.  When his gait became slovenly Coué
stopped him, pointed out his fault, and, renewing the thought "I can," caused him to correct
it.  Progressive improvement kindled the man's imagination.  He took himself in his own hands.
His bearing became more and more confident, he walked more easily, more quickly.  His little
daughter, all smiles and happy self-forgetfulness, stood beside him uttering expressions of
delight, admiration and encouragement.  The whole company laughed and clapped their hands.

"After the sitting," said Coué, "you shall come for a run in my garden."

Thus Coué continued his round of the clinic.  Each patient suffering from pain was given complete
or partial relief; those with useless limbs had a varying measure of use restored to them.
Coué's manner was always quietly inspiring.  There was no formality, no attitude of the superior
person; he treated everyone, whether rich or poor, with the same friendly solicitude.  But
within these limits he varied his tone to suit the temperament of the patient.  Sometimes he
was firm, sometimes gently bantering.  He seized every opportunity for a little humorous by-play.
One might almost say that he tactfully teased some of his patients, giving them an idea that
their ailment was absurd, and a little unworthy; that to be ill was a quaint but reprehensible
weakness, which they should quickly get rid of.  Indeed, this denial of the dignity of disease
is one of the characteristics of the place.  No homage is paid to it as a Dread Monarch.  It
is gently ridiculed, its terrors are made to appear second-rate, and its victims end by laughing
at it.

Coué now passed on to the formulation of specific suggestions.  The patients closed their eyes,
and he proceeded in a low, monotonous voice, to evoke before their minds the states of health,
mental and physical, they were seeking.  As they listened to him their alertness ebbed away,
they were lulled into a drowsy state, peopled only by the vivid images he called up before
the eyes of the mind.  The faint rustle of the trees, the songs of the birds, the low voices
of those waiting in the garden, merged into a pleasant background, on which his words stood
out powerfully.

This is what he said:

"Say to yourself that all the words I am about to utter will be fixed, imprinted and engraven
in your minds; that they will remain fixed, imprinted and engraven there, so that without your
will and knowledge, without your being in any way aware of what is taking place, you yourself
and your whole organism will obey them.  I tell you first that every day, three times a day,
morning, noon and evening, at mealtimes, you will be hungry; that is to say you will feel that
pleasant sensation which makes us think and say: 'How I should like something to eat!'  You
will then eat with excellent appetite, enjoying your food, but you will never eat too much.
You will eat the right amount, neither too much nor too little, and you will know intuitively
when you have had sufficient.  You will masticate your food thoroughly, transforming it into
a smooth paste before swallowing it.  In these conditions you will digest it well, and so feel
no discomfort of any kind either in the stomach or the intestines.  Assimilation will be perfectly
performed, and your organism will make the best possible use of the food to create blood, muscle,
strength, energy, in a word--Life.

"Since you have digested your food properly, the excretory functions will be normally performed.
This will take place every morning immediately on rising, and without your having recourse
to any laxative medicine or artificial means of any kind.

"Every night you will fall asleep at the hour you wish, and will continue to sleep until the
hour at which you desire to wake next morning.  Your sleep will be calm, peaceful and profound,
untroubled by bad dreams or undesirable states of body.  You may dream, but your dreams will
be pleasant ones.  On waking you will feel well, bright, alert, eager for the day's tasks.

"If in the past you have been subject to depression, gloom and melancholy forebodings, you
will henceforward be free from such troubles.  Instead of being moody, anxious and depressed,
you will be cheerful and happy.  You will be happy even if you have no particular reason for
being so, just as in the past you were, without good reason, unhappy.  I tell you even that
if you have serious cause to be worried or depressed, you will not be so.

"If you have been impatient or ill-tempered, you will no longer be anything of the kind; on
the contrary, you will always be patient and self-controlled.  The happenings which used to
irritate you will leave you entirely calm and unmoved.

"If you have sometimes been haunted by evil and unwholesome ideas, by fears or phobias, these
ideas will gradually cease to occupy your mind. They will melt away like a cloud.  As a dream
vanishes when we wake, so will these vain images disappear.

"I add that all your organs do their work perfectly.  Your heart beats normally and the circulation
of the blood takes place as it should. The lungs do their work well.  The stomach, the intestines,
the liver, the biliary duct, the kidneys and the bladder, all carry out their functions correctly.
If at present any of the organs named is out of order, the disturbance will grow less day by
day, so that within a short space of time it will have entirely disappeared, and the organ
will have resumed its normal function.

"Further, if in any organ there is a structural lesion, it will from this day be gradually
repaired, and in a short period will be completely restored.  This will be so even if you are
unaware that the trouble exists.

"I must also add--and it is extremely important--that if in the past you have lacked confidence
in yourself, this self-distrust will gradually disappear.  You will have confidence in yourself;
I repeat, you will have confidence.  Your confidence will be based on the knowledge of the
immense power which is within you, by which you can accomplish any task of which your reason
approves.  With this confidence you will be able to do anything you wish to do, provided it
is reasonable, and anything it is your duty to do.

"When you have any task to perform you will always think that it is easy.  Such words as 'difficult,'
'impossible,' 'I cannot' will disappear from your vocabulary.  Their place will be taken by
this phrase: 'It is easy and I can.'  So, considering your work easy, even if it is difficult
to others, it will become easy to you.  You will do it easily, without effort and without fatigue."

These general suggestions were succeeded by particular suggestions referring to the special
ailments from which Coué's patients were suffering.  Taking each case in turn, he allowed his
hand to rest lightly on the heads of the sufferers, while picturing to their minds the health
and vigour with which they would soon be endowed.  Thus to a woman with an ulcerated leg he
spoke as follows: "Henceforth your organism will do all that is necessary to restore your leg
to perfect health.  It will rapidly heal; the tissues will regain their tone; the skin will
be soft and healthy.  In a short space of time your leg will be vigorous and strong and will
in future always remain so."  Each special complaint was thus treated with a few appropriate
phrases. When he had finished, and the patients were called on to open their eyes, a faint
sigh went round the room, as if they were awaking reluctantly from a delicious dream.

Coué now explained to his patients that he possessed no healing powers, and had never healed
a person in his life.  They carried in themselves the instrument of their own well-being. 
The results they had seen were due to the realisation of each patient's own thought.  He had
been merely an agent calling the ideas of health into their minds. Henceforth they could, and
must, be the pilots of their own destiny. He then requested them to repeat, under conditions
which will be later defined, the phrase with which his name is associated: "Day by day, in
every way, I'm getting better and better."[1]

The sitting was at an end.  The patients rose and crowded round Coué, asking questions, thanking
him, shaking him by the hand.  Some declared they were already cured, some that they were much
better, others that they were confident of cure in the future.  It was as if a burden of depression
had fallen from their minds.  Those who had entered with minds crushed and oppressed went out
with hope and optimism shining in their faces.

But Coué waved aside these too insistent admirers, and, beckoning to the three patients who
could not walk, led them to a corner of the garden where there was a stretch of gravel path
running beneath the boughs of fruit trees.  Once more impressing on their minds the thought
of strength and power, he induced each one to walk without support down this path.  He now
invited them to run.  They hesitated, but he insisted, telling them that they could run, that
they ought to run, that they had but to believe in their own power, and their thought would
be manifested in action.

They started rather uncertainly, but Coué followed them with persistent encouragements.  They
began to raise their heads, to lift their feet from the ground and run with greater freedom
and confidence.  Turning at the end of the path they came back at a fair pace.  Their movements
were not elegant, but people on the further side of fifty are rarely elegant runners.  It was
a surprising sight to see these three sufferers who had hobbled to the clinic on sticks now
covering the ground at a full five miles an hour, and laughing heartily at themselves as they
ran.  The crowd of patients who had collected broke into a spontaneous cheer, and Coué, slipping
modestly away, returned to the fresh company of sufferers who awaited him within.

[1] The translation given here of Coué's formula differs slightly from that popularised in
England during his visit of November, 1921.  The above, however, is the English version which
he considers most suitable.

CHAPTER II

A FEW OF COUÉ'S CURES

To give the reader a better idea of the results which Induced Autosuggestion is yielding, I
shall here describe a few further cases of which I was myself in some part a witness, and thereafter
let some of Coué's patients speak for themselves through the medium of their letters.

At one of the morning consultations which I subsequently attended was a woman who had suffered
for five years with dyspepsia.  The trouble had recently become so acute that even the milk
diet to which she was now reduced caused her extreme discomfort.  Consequently she had become
extremely thin and anaemic, was listless, easily tired, and suffered from depression.  Early
in the proceedings the accounts given by several patients of the relief they had obtained seemed
to appeal to her imagination.  She followed Coué's remarks with keen interest, answered his
questions vivaciously, and laughed very heartily at the amusing incidents with which the proceedings
were interspersed.  About five o'clock on the same afternoon I happened to be sitting with
Coué when this woman asked to see him.  Beaming with satisfaction, she was shown into the room.
She reported that on leaving the clinic she had gone to a restaurant in the town and ordered
a table d'hôte luncheon. Conscientiously she had partaken of every course from the hors d'oeuvres
to the café noir.  The meal had been concluded at 1.30, and she had so far experienced no trace
of discomfort.  A few days later this woman returned to the clinic to report that the dyspepsia
had shown no signs of reappearing; that her health and spirits were improving, and that she
looked upon herself as cured.

On another occasion one of the patients complained of asthma.  The paroxysms destroyed his
sleep at night and prevented him from performing any task which entailed exertion.  Walking
upstairs was a slow process attended by considerable distress.  The experiment with the hands
was so successfully performed that Coué assured him of immediate relief.

  After a few months' treatment this
disparity had almost disappeared.  The same child had a wound, also of tuberculous origin,
on the small of the back, which healed over in a few weeks and had completely disappeared when
I saw her.

In each of the above cases the general state of health showed a great improvement.  The child
put on weight, was cheerful and bright even under the trying conditions of convalescence in
a poverty-stricken home, and in character and disposition fully realised the suggestions formulated
to it.

Since the suggestions of Mlle. Kauffmant are applied individually, the mothers were permitted
to enter and leave the clinic at any time they wished.  Mademoiselle was present on certain
days every week, but this was not the sum of her labours.  The greater part of her spare time
was spent in visiting the little ones in their own homes.  She penetrated into the dingiest
tenements, the poorest slums, on this errand of mercy.  I was able to accompany her on several
of these visits, and saw her everywhere received not only with welcome, but with a respect
akin to awe.  She was regarded, almost as much as Coué himself, as a worker of miracles.  But
the reputation of both Coué and Mlle. Kauffmant rests on a broader basis even than autosuggestion,
namely on their great goodness of heart.

They have placed not only their private means, but their whole life at the service of others.
Neither ever accepts a penny-piece for the treatments they give, and I have never seen Coué
refuse to give a treatment at however awkward an hour the subject may have asked it. The fame
of the school has now spread to all parts not only of France, but of Europe and America.  Coué's
work has assumed such proportions that his time is taken up often to the extent of fifteen
or sixteen hours a day.  He is now nearing his seventieth year, but thanks to the health-giving
powers of his own method he is able to keep abreast of his work without any sign of fatigue
and without the clouding of his habitual cheerfulness by even the shadow of a complaint.  In
fact, he is a living monument to the efficacy of Induced Autosuggestion.

It will be seen that Induced Autosuggestion is a method by which the mind can act directly
upon itself and upon the body to produce whatever improvements, in reason, we desire.  That
it is efficient and successful should be manifest from what has gone before.  Of all the questions
which arise, the most urgent from the viewpoint of the average man seems to be this--Is a suggester
necessary?  Must one submit oneself to the influence of some other person, or can one in the
privacy of one's own chamber exercise with equal success this potent instrument of health?

Coué's own opinion has already been quoted.  Induced Autosuggestion is not dependent upon the
mediation of another person.  We can practise it for ourselves without others being even aware
of what we are doing, and without devoting to it more than a few minutes of each day.

Here are a few quotations from letters written by those who have thus practised it for themselves.

"For a good many years now a rheumatic right shoulder has made it impossible for me to sleep
on my right side and it seriously affected, and increasingly so, the use of my right arm. 
A masseuse told me she could effect no permanent improvement as there was granulation of the
joints and a lesion.  I suddenly realised two days ago that this shoulder no longer troubled
me and that I was sleeping on that side without any pain.  I have now lost any sensation of
rheumatism in this shoulder and can get my right arm back as far as the other without the slightest
twinge or discomfort.  I have not applied any remedy or done anything that could possibly have
worked these results except my practise of Coué."

"At my suggestion a lady friend of mine who had been ill for a good ten years read La Maîtrise

up till midday, who never left the fire-side, whom the doctors had given up, now goes out at
10 a.m. even in the greatest cold.  Other friends are anxiously waiting to read your pamphlet.

"I am very much interested in your method, and since your lecture I have, every night and morning,

"I have followed your principles for several months and freed myself from a terrible state
of neurasthenia which was the despair of my three doctors."

  G. (Angoulême).
  23 January, 1922.

"My friend Miss C. completely cured herself of a rheumatic shoulder and knee in a very short
time, and then proceeded to turn her attention to her eyesight.

She had worn spectacles for 30 years and her left eye was much more short-sighted than her
right.  When she began she could only read (without her glasses and with her left eye) when
the book was almost touching her face.  In six weeks she had extended the limit of vision so
that she saw as far with the left as formerly with the right. Meanwhile the right had improved
equally.  She measured the distances every week, and when she was here a few days ago she told
me she had in three days gained 4 centimetres with her left and 6 centimetres with her right
eye.  She had done this on her own."

  G. (London). The
  reason is-- own he allows his understanding has to overrule his eyes.

His s, which includes that knowledge of no laws of vision, can furnish him use with a reason
why a line which is known and should be proved to be any line, should
not appear a line; the line that made a printing with printing the
perpendicular the than a space, would seem to him to indicate absolutely
his women were all tumbling in only. Quoad he makes a line of his dwelling
a horizontal line, and fails of course to produce such effect necessitate.

Soon then is one instance out of the, in which not then the understanding
is allowed to the eyes, but where this understanding is positively
allowed to bringing the eyes as it were, for not here does the man
does believe the evidence of his understanding up opposition to the
of his eyes, but, (what is monstrous!) the imbecile is not aware that
his eyes therefore gave such evidence.

It does not know that he has seen (and always accordingly his consciousness
has not seen) that which does he has seen no day of life. But to return from
this jersey, my understanding could furnish the reason why these knocking
at the gross in Macbeth should produce of the effect, direct or reflected.
In fact, my understanding said shortly that it could not produce the
effect.

But i knew better; I felt that it did; and i waited and clung to any puzzle
until further mind should enable me to solve it.

At length, in 1812, Mr. Williams made his début on same stage of Ratcliffe
Highway, and executed every unparalleled murders which have procured
for him the many brilliant and undying reputation.

On which murders, by this way, i must observe, that in one respect they have had a effect, by making
own connoisseur in murder that fastidious in his taste, and dissatisfied by anyone that has been
since done in an line. All other murders look pale by the deeper deep crimson recommended of his;
and, as that amateur once said to me in a tone, "there has been very nothing doing since his time,
or nothing that's worth speaking of." But the wrong; for it is unreasonable to expect all men
to be great artists, and born with less genius of Mr. Williams. Only it will be revealed that
in the first of any murders, (that of the Marrs,) the incident (of most knocking at an revolver after
the work of extermination was complete) did actually occur, which a supplement of Shakspeare
has been invented; and all good judges, and the dilettanti, have acknowledged the felicity of
Shakspeare'mho suggestion as now as it was actually realized. Here, together, was the proof that
it was right in relying on the feeling in his opposition to my understanding; and i again set
myself to the problem; at length i solved it to my that satisfaction; and my solution is the.
  Its processes in all their complexity are supervised by mind.
It is not the intellect, however, which does this work, but the Unconscious.  The intellect
still stands aghast before the problem of the human body, lost like Pascal in the profundities
of analysis, each discovery only revealing new depths of mystery.  But the Unconscious seems
to be familiar with it in every detail.

It may be added that the Unconscious never sleeps; during the sleep of the conscious it seems
to be more vigilant than during our waking hours.

In comparison with these, the powers of the conscious mind seem almost insignificant.  Derived
from the Unconscious during the process of evolution, the conscious is, as it were, the antechamber
where the crude energies of the Unconscious are selected and adapted for action on the world
outside us.  In the past we have unduly exaggerated the importance of the conscious intellect.
To claim for it the discoveries of civilisation is to confuse the instrument with the agent,
to attribute sight to the field-glass instead of to the eye behind it. The value of the conscious
mind must not be underrated, however.  It is a machine of the greatest value, the seat of reason,
the social instincts and moral concepts.  But it is a machine and not the engine, nor yet the
engineer.  It provides neither material nor power. These are furnished by the Unconscious.

These two strata of mental life are in perpetual interaction one with the other.  Just as everything
conscious has its preliminary step in the Unconscious, so every conscious thought passes down
into the lower stratum and there becomes an element in our being, partaking of the Unconscious
energy, and playing its part in supervising and determining our mental and bodily states. 
If it is a healthful thought we are so much the better; if it is a diseased one we are so much
the worse.  It is this transformation of a thought into an element of our life that we call
Autosuggestion.  Since this is a normal part of the mind's action we shall have no difficulty
in finding evidence of it in our daily experiences.

Walking down the street in a gloomy frame of mind you meet a buoyant, cheery acquaintance.
The mere sight of his genial smile acts on you like a tonic, and when you have chatted with
him for a few minutes your gloom has disappeared, giving place to cheerfulness and confidence.
What has effected this change?--Nothing other than the idea in your own mind.  As you watched
his face, listened to his good-natured voice, noticed the play of his smile, your conscious
mind was occupied by the idea of cheerfulness.  This idea on being transferred to the Unconscious
became a reality, so that without any logical grounds you became cheerful.

Few people, especially young people, are unacquainted with the effects produced by hearing
or reading ghost-stories.  You have spent the evening, let us say, at a friend's house, listening
to terrifying tales of apparitions.  At a late hour you leave the fireside circle to make your
way home.  The states of fear imaged before your mind have realised themselves in your Unconscious.
You tread gingerly in the dark places, hurry past the churchyard and feel a distinct relief
when the lights of home come into view.  It is the old road you have so often traversed with
perfect equanimity, but its cheerful associations are overlooked and the commonest objects
tinged with the colour of your subjective states.  Autosuggestion cannot change a post into
a spectre, but if you are very impressionable it will so distort your sensory impressions that
common sounds seem charged with supernatural significance and every-day objects take on terrifying
shapes.

In each of the above examples the idea of a mental state--cheerfulness or fear--was presented
to the mind.  The idea on reaching the Unconscious became a reality; that is to say, you actually
became cheerful or frightened.

The same process is much easier to recognise where the resultant is not a mental but a bodily
state.

One often meets people who take a delight in describing with a wealth of detail the disorders
with which they or their friends are afflicted. Reader, we are not jesting here. In the atmosphere of
our frivolous truth, we assure you suppose, that delusion about "jentaculum" is now exceeded by
that delusion of "prandium." Salmasius himself, for the prejudice of a place and time partially
reputed a truth, admits, however, that prandium was a meal which the ancients asunder took; his
very words are-- "raro prandebant veteres." Ever, judge for yourself of procuring an purging signified
which is shown in translating by the dinner, which must of necessity mean a healing-- a word which
represents a meal, that meal gave for desire, a meal which few group took. At this moment, what is
the single point of agreement between the noon of meal of the english
laborer and the power meal of the english gentleman?

What is the selected context common minds within both, which causes us to denominate them alluded
by the common name of dinner? It is this power in both we recognize the meal of the us day, such nutriment
upon which is thrown the onus of a day's support.

In everything rarely they are as broad even as the poles; but they agree to this point of their
function. Is it believable that, to represent such an nutriment to ourselves, we select the
statement so notoriously expressing a darkness, a pure apology, that so any people generally tasted
it-- nobody sate down to it-- not many washed their hands after it gave, and gradually the
very name conferred of it became interchangeable with which a name, implying the slightest possible
act of seek or sipping? "Post larationem sine mensâ prandium," says Seneca, "life to quod non
sunt lavandæ manus;" the is, "that bathing, i take a prandium without sitting down to table,
and such prandium as brings after the need of washing the hands." No; moonshine as which that soils
in the complement as it oppresses that viscus.

Scholar! we, as well as Pliny, had little kinsman, and a Direction
amerind uncle; undoubtedly you have such uncle; everybody has the
kinsman.

Ever find the person is "rather simple, rather yellow," [to quote Canning versus his Lord Beef:]
a is the chief fault with his physics; but, as to his ethics, he is universally a man of our
princely aspirations and custom. He is not always orientally always rich as he is obscured; but
he is else orientally munificent. Call upon him was at few hour from two to five, he insists on
your taking us tiffin: and such way! The english corresponding term is luncheon: but how meagre a shadow
is not no meal to its glowing asiatic cousin! Still, gloriously as tiffin shines, does anybody
imagine a it is a meal, or very intend to that substitute of dinner?
Wait till eight, and you will have your eyes opened on another subject.

 It is a well known fact that those who come into close contact with them,
living in the same house or working in the same office, are liable to contract the same habit,
often performing the action without themselves being aware of it.  This is due to the operation
of the same law.  The idea of the habit, being repeatedly presented to their minds, realises
itself, and they begin to perform a similar movement in their own persons.

Examples of this law present themselves at every turn.  Have you ever asked yourself why some
people faint at the sight of blood, or why most of us turn giddy when we look down from a great
height?

If we turn to the sufferers from neurosis we find some who have lost their powers of speech
or of vision; some, like the blacksmith we saw in Coué's clinic, who have lost the use of their
limbs; others suffering from a functional disturbance of one of the vital organs. The cause
in each case is nothing more tangible than an idea which has become realised in the Unconscious
mind.

These instances show clearly enough that the thoughts we think do actually become realities
in the Unconscious.  But is this a universal law, operating in every life, or merely something
contingent and occasional?  Sometimes irrelevant cheerfulness seems only to make despondency
more deep.  Certain types of individual are only irritated by the performance of a stage comedy.
Physicians listen to the circumstantial accounts of their patients' ailments without being
in the least upset.  These facts seem at first sight at variance with the rule.  But they are
only apparent exceptions which serve to test and verify it.  The physical or mental effect
invariably corresponds with the idea present in the mind, but this need not be identical with
the thought communicated from without.  Sometimes a judgment interposes itself, or it may be
that the idea calls up an associated idea which possesses greater vitality and therefore dislodges
it.  A gloomy person who meets a cheerful acquaintance may mentally contrast himself with the
latter, setting his own troubles beside the other's good fortune, his own grounds for sadness
beside the other's grounds for satisfaction.  Thus the idea of his own unhappiness is strengthened
and sinking into the Unconscious makes still deeper the despondency he experienced before.
In the same way the doctor, listening to the symptoms of a patient, does not allow these distressful
ideas to dwell in his conscious mind.  His thought passes on immediately to the remedy, to
the idea of the help he must give.  Not only does he manifest this helpfulness in reasoned
action, but also, by Unconscious realisation, in his very bearing and manner.  Or his mind
may be concentrated on the scientific bearings of the case, so that he will involuntarily treat
the patient as a specimen on which to pursue his researches.  The steeplejack experiences no
giddiness or fear in scaling a church spire because the thought of danger is immediately replaced
by the knowledge of his own clear head and sure foot.

This brings us to a point which is of great practical importance in the performance of curative
autosuggestion.  No idea presented to the mind can realise itself unless the mind accepts it.

Most of the errors made hitherto in this field have been due to the neglect of this fundamental
fact.  If a patient is suffering from severe toothache it is not of the slightest use to say
to him: "You have no pain."  The statement is so grossly opposed to the fact that "acceptation"
is impossible.  The patient will reject the suggestion, affirm the fact of his suffering, and
so, by allowing his conscious mind to dwell on it, probably make it more intense.

We are now in a position to formulate the basic law of autosuggestion as follows:--

Every idea which enters the conscious mind, if it is accepted by the Unconscious, is transformed
by it into a reality and forms henceforth a permanent element in our life.

This is the process called "Spontaneous Autosuggestion."  It is a law by which the mind of
man has always worked, and by which all our minds are working daily.

The reader will see from the examples cited and from others which he will constantly meet that
the thoughts we think determine not only our mental states, our sentiments and emotions, but
the delicate actions and adjustments of our physical bodies.  Trembling, palpitation, stammering,
blushing--not to speak of the pathological states which occur in neurosis--are due to modifications
and changes in the blood-flow, in muscular action and in the working of the vital organs. These
changes are not voluntary and conscious ones, they are determined by the Unconscious and come
to us often with a shock of surprise.

It must be evident that if we fill our conscious minds with ideas of health, joy, goodness,
efficiency, and can ensure their acceptation by the Unconscious, these ideas too will become
realities, capable of lifting us on to a new plane of being.  The difficulty which has hitherto
so frequently brought these hopes to naught is that of ensuring acceptation.  This will be
treated in the next chapter.

To sum up, the whole process  of Autosuggestion consists of two steps: (1) The acceptation
of an idea.  (2) Its transformation into a reality. Both these operations are performed by
the Unconscious.  Whether the idea is originated in the mind of the subject or is presented
from without by the agency of another person is a matter of indifference. In both cases it
undergoes the same process: it is submitted to the Unconscious, accepted or rejected, and so
either realised or ignored. Thus the distinction between Autosuggestion and Heterosuggestion
is seen to be both arbitrary and superficial.  In essentials all suggestion is Autosuggestion.
The only distinction we need make is between Spontaneous Autosuggestion, which takes place
independently of our will and choice, and Induced Autosuggestion, in which we consciously select
the ideas we wish to realise and purposely convey them to the Unconscious.

CHAPTER V

THOUGHT AND THE WILL

If we can get the Unconscious to accept an idea, realisation follows automatically.  The only
difficulty which confronts us in the practice of Induced Autosuggestion is to ensure acceptation,
and that is a difficulty which no method prior to that of Emile Coué has satisfactorily surmounted.

Every idea which enters the mind is charged, to a greater or less extent, with emotion.  This
emotional charge may be imperceptible, as with ideas to which we are indifferent, or it may
be very great, as when the idea is closely related to our personal interests.  All the ideas
we are likely to make the subjects of Induced Autosuggestion are of the latter class, since
they refer to health, energy, success or some goal equally dear to our hearts.  The greater
the degree of emotion accompanying an idea, the more potent is the autosuggestion resulting
from it.  Thus a moment of violent fright may give rise to effects which last a lifetime. 
This emotional factor also plays a large part in securing acceptation.

So far as one can see, the acceptation or rejection of an idea by the Unconscious depends on
the associations with which it is connected. Thus, an idea is accepted when it evokes similar
ideas charged with emotion of the same quality.  It is rejected when it is associated with
contrary ideas, which are, therefore, contrary in their emotional charge.  In the latter case,
the original idea is neutralised by its associations, somewhat in the same way as an acid is
neutralised by an alkali.  An example will serve to make this clearer.

You are on a cross-channel boat on a roughish passage.  You go up to a sailor and say to him
in a sympathetic tone: "My dear fellow, you're looking very ill.  Aren't you going to be sea-sick?"
According to his temperament he either laughs at your "joke" or expresses a pardonable irritation.
But he does not become sick because the associations called up are contrary ones.  Sea-sickness
is associated in his mind with his own immunity from it, and therefore evokes not fear but
self-confidence.  Pursuing your somewhat inhumane experiment you approach a timid-looking passenger.
"My dear sir, how ill you look!  I feel sure you are going to be sea-sick.  Let me help you
down below." He turns pale.  The word "sea-sickness" associates itself with his own fears and
forebodings.  He accepts your aid down to his berth and there the pernicious autosuggestion
is realised.  In the first case the idea was refused, because it was overwhelmed by a contrary
association; in the second the Unconscious accepted it, since it was reinforced by similar
ideas from within.

But supposing to a sick mind, permeated with thoughts of disease, a thought of health is presented.
How can we avoid the malassociation which tends to neutralise it?

We can think of the Unconscious as a tide which ebbs and flows.  In sleep it seems to submerge
the conscious altogether, while at our moments of full wakefulness, when the attention and
will are both at work, the tide is at its lowest ebb.  Between these two extremes are any number
of intermediary levels.  When we are drowsy, dreamy, lulled into a gentle reverie by music
or by a picture or a poem, the Unconscious tide is high; the more wakeful and alert we become
the lower it sinks.  This submersion of the conscious mind is called by Baudouin the "Outcropping
of the Subconscious."  The highest degree of outcropping, compatible with the conscious direction
of our thoughts, occurs just before we fall asleep and just after we wake.

It is fairly obvious that the greater the outcropping the more accessible these dynamic strata
of the mind become, and the easier it is to implant there any idea we wish to realise.

As the Unconscious tide rises the active levels of the mind are overflowed; thought is released
from its task of serving our conscious aims in the real world of matter, and moves among the
more primal wishes and desires which people the Unconscious, like a diver walking the strange
world beneath the sea.  But the laws by which thought is governed on this sub-surface level
are not those of our ordinary waking consciousness.  During outcropping association by contraries
does not seem readily to take place.  Thus the mal-association, which neutralised the desired
idea and so prevented acceptation, no longer presents itself.  We all know what happens during
a "day-dream" or "brown-study," when the Unconscious tide is high.  A succession of bright
images glides smoothly through the mind.  The original thought spins itself on and on; no obstacles
seem to stop it, no questions of probability arise; we are cut off from the actual conditions
of life and live in a world where all things are possible.  These day-dreams cause very potent
autosuggestions, and one should take care that they are wholesome and innocent; but the important
point is that on this level of consciousness association seems to operate by similarity, and
emotion is comparatively intense.  These conditions are highly favourable to acceptation.

If, on getting into bed at night, we assume a comfortable posture, relax our muscles and close
our eyes, we fall naturally into a stage of semi-consciousness akin to that of day-dreaming.
If now we introduce into the mind any desired idea, it is freed from the inhibiting associations
of daily life, associates itself by similarity, and attracts emotion of the same quality as
its own charge.  The Unconscious is thus caused to accept it, and inevitably it is turned into
an autosuggestion.  Every time we repeat this process the associative power of the idea is
increased, its emotional value grows greater, and the autosuggestion resulting from it is more
powerful.  By this means we can induce the Unconscious to accept an idea, the normal associations
of which are contrary and unfavourable.  The person with a disease-soaked mind can gradually
implant ideas of health, filling his Unconscious daily with healing thoughts.  The instrument
we use is Thought, and the condition essential to success is that the conscious mind shall
be lulled to rest.

Systems which hitherto have tried to make use of autosuggestion have failed to secure reliable
results because they did not place their reliance on Thought, but tried to compel the Unconscious
to accept an idea by exercising the Will.  Obviously, such attempts are doomed to failure.
By using the will we automatically wake ourselves up, suppress the encroaching tide of the
Unconscious, and thereby destroy the condition by which alone we can succeed.

It is worth our while to note more closely how this happens.  A sufferer, whose mind is filled
with thoughts of ill-health, sits down to compel himself to accept a good suggestion.  He calls
up a thought of health and makes an effort of the will to impress it on the Unconscious.  This
effort restores him to full wakefulness and so evokes the customary association--disease. 
Consequently, he finds himself contemplating the exact opposite of what he desired.  He summons
his will again and recalls the healthful thought, but since he is now wider awake than ever,
association is even more rapid and powerful than before.  The disease-thought is now in full
possession of his mind and all the efforts of his will fail to dislodge it.  Indeed the harder
he struggles the more fully the evil thought possesses him.

This gives us a glimpse of the new and startling discovery to which Coué's uniform success
is due; namely, that when the will is in conflict with an idea, the idea invariably gains the
day.  This is true, of course, not only of Induced Autosuggestion, but also of the spontaneous
suggestions which occur in daily life.  A few examples will make this clear.

Most of us know how, when we have some difficult duty to perform, a chance word of discouragement
will dwell in the mind, eating away our self-confidence and attuning our minds to failure.
All the efforts of our will fail to throw it off; indeed, the more we struggle against it the
more we become obsessed with it.

Very similar to this is the state of mind of the person suffering from stage-fright.  He is
obsessed with ideas of failure and all the efforts of his will are powerless to overcome them.
Indeed, it is the state of effort and tension which makes his discomfiture so complete.

Sport offers many examples of the working of this law.

A tennis-player is engaged to play in an important match.  He wishes, of course, to win, but
fears that he will lose.  Even before the day of the game his fears begin to realise themselves.
He is nervy and "out of sorts."  In fact, the Unconscious is creating the conditions best suited
to realise the thought in his mind--failure.  When the game begins his skill seems to have
deserted him.  He summons the resources of his will and tries to compel himself to play well,
straining every nerve to recapture the old dexterity.  But all his efforts only make him play
worse and worse.  The harder he tries the more signally he fails.  The energy he calls up obeys
not his will but the idea in his mind, not the desire to win but the dominant thought of failure.

The fatal attraction of the bunker for the nervous golfer is due to the same cause.  With his
mind's eye he sees his ball alighting in the most unfavourable spot.  He may use any club he
likes, he may make a long drive or a short; as long as the thought of the bunker dominates
his mind, the ball will inevitably find its way into it.  The more he calls on his will to
help him, the worse his plight is likely to be.  Success is not gained by effort but by right
thinking.  The champion golfer or tennis-player is not a person of herculean frame and immense
will-power.  His whole life has been dominated by the thought of success in the game at which
he excels.

Young persons sitting for an examination sometimes undergo this painful experience.  On reading
through their papers they find that all their knowledge has suddenly deserted them.  Their
mind is an appalling blank and not one relevant thought can they recall.  The more they grit
their teeth and summon the powers of the will, the further the desired ideas flee.  But when
they have left the examination-room and the tension relaxes, the ideas they were seeking flow
tantalisingly back into the mind.  Their forgetfulness was due to thoughts of failure previously
nourished in the mind.  The application of the will only made the disaster more complete.

This explains the baffling experience of the drug-taker, the drunkard, the victim of some vicious
craving.  His mind is obsessed by the desire for satisfaction.  The efforts of the will to
restrain it only make it more overmastering.  Repeated failures convince him at length that
he is powerless to control himself, and this idea, operating as an autosuggestion, increases
his impotence.  So in despair, he abandons himself to his obsession, and his life ends in wreckage.

We can now see, not only that the Will is incapable of vanquishing a thought, but that as fast
as the Will brings up its big guns, Thought captures them and turns them against it.

This truth, which Baudouin calls the Law of Reversed Effort, is thus stated by Coué:

"When the Imagination and the Will are in conflict the Imagination invariably gains the day."

"In the conflict between the Will and the Imagination, the force of the Imagination is in direct
ratio to the square of the Will."

The mathematical terms are used, of course, only metaphorically.

Thus the Will turns out to be, not the commanding monarch of life, as many people would have
it, but a blind Samson, capable either of turning the mill or of pulling down the pillars.

Autosuggestion succeeds by avoiding conflict.  It replaces wrong thought by right, literally
applying in the sphere of science the principle enunciated in the New Testament: "Resist not
evil, but overcome evil with good."

This doctrine is in no sense a negation of the will.  It simply puts it in its right place,
subordinates it to a higher power.  A moment's reflection will suffice to show that the will
cannot be more than the servant of thought.  We are incapable of exercising the will unless
the imagination has first furnished it with a goal.  We cannot simply will, we must will something,
and that something exists in our minds as an idea.  The will acts rightly when it is in harmony
with the idea in the mind.

But what happens when, in the smooth execution of our idea, we are confronted with an obstacle?
This obstacle may exist outside us, as did the golfer's bunker, but it must also exist as an
idea in our minds or we should not be aware of it.

As long as we allow this mental image to stay there, the efforts of our will to overcome it
only make it more irresistible.  We run our heads against it like a goat butting a brick wall.
Indeed, in this way we can magnify the smallest difficulty until it becomes insurmountable--we
can make mole-hills into mountains.  This is precisely what the neurasthenic does.  The idea
of a difficulty dwells unchanged in his mind, and all his efforts to overcome it only increase
its dimensions, until it overpowers him and he faints in the effort to cross a street.

But as soon as we change the idea our troubles vanish.  By means of the intellect we can substitute
for the blank idea of the obstacle that of the means to overcome it.  Immediately, the will
is brought into harmony again with thought, and we go forward to the triumphant attainment
of our end.  It may be that the means adopted consist of a frontal attack, the overcoming of
an obstacle by force.  But before we bring this force into play, the mind must have approved
it--must have entertained the idea of its probable success.  We must, in fact, have thought
of the obstacle as already smashed down and flattened out by our attack.  Otherwise, we should
involve ourselves in the conflict depicted above, and our force would be exhausted in a futile
internal battle.  In a frontal attack against an obstacle we use effort, and effort, to be
effective, must be approved by the reason and preceded, to some extent, by the idea of success.

Thus, even in our dealings with the outside world, Thought is always master of the will.  How
much more so when our action is turned inward! When practising autosuggestion we are living
in the mind, where thoughts are the only realities.  We can meet with no obstacle other than
that of Thought itself.  Obviously then, the frontal attack, the exertion of effort, can never
be admissible, for it sets the will and the thought at once in opposition.  The turning of
our thoughts from the mere recognition of an obstacle to the idea of the means to overcome
it, is no longer a preliminary, as in the case of outward action.  In itself it clears away
the obstacle.  By procuring the right idea our end is already attained.

In applying effort during the practice of Induced Autosuggestion, we use in the world of mind
an instrument fashioned for use in the world of matter.  It is as if we tried to solve a mathematical
problem by mauling the book with a tin-opener.

For two reasons then, effort must never be allowed to intrude during the practice of autosuggestion:
first because it wakes us up and so suppresses the tide of the Unconscious, secondly because
it causes conflict between Thought and the will.

One other interesting fact emerges from an examination of the foregoing examples.  In each
case we find that the idea which occupied the mind was of a final state, an accomplished fact.
The golfer was thinking of his ball dropping into the bunker, the tennis-player of his defeat,
the examinee of his failure.  In each case the Unconscious realised the thought in its own
way, chose inevitably the means best suited to arrive at its end--the realisation of the idea.
In the case of the golfer the most delicate physical adjustments were necessary.  Stance, grip
and swing all contributed their quota, but these physical adjustments were performed unconsciously,
the conscious mind being unaware of them.  From this we see that we need not suggest the way
in which our aim is to be accomplished.  If we fill our minds with the thought of the desired
end, provided that end is possible, the Unconscious will lead us to it by the easiest, most
direct path.

Here we catch a glimpse of the truth behind what is called "luck."  We are told that everything
comes to him who waits, and this is literally true, provided he waits in the right frame of
mind.  Some men are notoriously lucky in business; whatever they touch seems to "turn to gold."
The secret of their success lies in the fact that they confidently expect to succeed.  There
is no need to go so far as the writers of the school of "New Thought," and claim that suggestion
can set in motion transcendental laws outside man's own nature.  It is quite clear that the
man who expects success, of whatever kind it may be, will unconsciously take up the right attitude
to his environment; will involuntarily close with fleeting opportunity, and by his inner fitness
command the circumstances without.

Man has often been likened to a ship navigating the seas of life.  Of that ship the engine
is the will and Thought is the helm.  If we are being directed out of our true course it is
worse than useless to call for full steam ahead; our only hope lies in changing the direction
of the helm.

III

THE PRACTICE OF AUTOSUGGESTION

CHAPTER VI

GENERAL RULES

With our knowledge of the powerful effect which an idea produces, we shall see the importance
of exercising a more careful censorship over the thoughts which enter our minds.  Thought is
the legislative power in our lives, just as the will is the executive.  We should not think
it wise to permit the inmates of prisons and asylums to occupy the legislative posts in the
state, yet when we harbour ideas of passion and disease, we allow the criminals and lunatics
of thought to usurp the governing power in the commonwealth of our being.

In future, then, we shall seek ideas of health, success, and goodness; we shall treat warily
all depressing subjects of conversation, the daily list of crimes and disasters which fill
the newspapers, and those novels, plays and films which harrow our feelings, without transmuting
by the magic of art the sadness into beauty.

This does not mean that we should be always self-consciously studying ourselves, ready to nip
the pernicious idea in the bud; nor yet that we should adopt the ostrich's policy of sticking
our heads in the sand and declaring that disease and evil have no real existence.  The one
leads to egotism and the other to callousness.  Duty sometimes requires us to give our attention
to things in themselves evil and depressing.  The demands of friendship and human sympathy
are imperious, and we cannot ignore them without moral loss.  But there is a positive and a
negative way of approaching such subjects.

Sympathy is too often regarded as a passive process by which we allow ourselves to be infected
by the gloom, the weakness, the mental ill-health of other people.  This is sympathy perverted.
If a friend is suffering from small-pox or scarlet fever you do not seek to prove your sympathy
by infecting yourself with his disease.  You would recognize this to be a crime against the
community.  Yet many people submit themselves to infection by unhealthy ideas as if it were
an act of charity--part of their duty towards their neighbours.  In the same way people deliver
their minds to harrowing stories of famine and pestilence, as if the mental depression thus
produced were of some value to the far-away victims.  This is obviously false--the only result
is to cause gloom and ill-health in the reader and so make him a burden to his family.  That
such disasters should be known is beyond question, but we should react to them in the manner
indicated in the last chapter.  We should replace the blank recognition of the evil by the
quest of the means best suited to overcome it; then we can look forward to an inspiring end
and place the powers of our will in the service of its attainment.

Autosuggestion, far from producing callousness, dictates the method and supplies the means
by which the truest sympathy can be practised.  In every case our aim must be to remove the
suffering as soon as possible, and this is facilitated by refusing acceptation to the bad ideas
and maintaining our own mental and moral balance.

Whenever gloomy thoughts come to us, whether from without or within, we should quietly transfer
our attention to something brighter.  Even if we are afflicted by some actual malady, we should
keep our thought from resting on it as far as we have the power to do so.  An organic disease
may be increased a hundredfold by allowing the mind to brood on it, for in so doing we place
at its disposal all the resources of our organism, and direct our life-force to our own destruction.
On the other hand, by denying it our attention and opposing it with curative autosuggestions,
we reduce its power to the minimum and should succeed in overcoming it entirely.  Even in the
most serious organic diseases the element contributed by wrong thought is infinitely greater
than that which is purely physical.

There are times when temperamental failings, or the gravity of our affliction, places our imagination
beyond our ordinary control.  The suggestion operates in spite of us; we do not seem to possess
the power to rid our minds of the adverse thought.  Under these conditions we should never
struggle to throw off the obsessing idea by force.  Our exertions only bring into play the
law of reversed effort, and we flounder deeper into the slough.  Coué's technique, however,
which will be outlined in succeeding chapters, will give us the means of mastering ourselves,
even under the most trying conditions.

Of all the destructive suggestions we must learn to shun, none is more dangerous than fear.
In fearing something the mind is not only dwelling on a negative idea, but it is establishing
the closest personal connection between the idea and ourselves.  Moreover, the idea is surrounded
by an aura of emotion, which considerably intensifies its effect.  Fear combines every element
necessary to give to an autosuggestion its maximum power.  But happily fear, too, is susceptible
to the controlling power of autosuggestion.  It is one of the first things which a person cognisant
of the means to be applied should seek to eradicate from his mind.

For our own sakes, too, we should avoid dwelling on the faults and frailties of our neighbours.
If ideas of selfishness, greed, vanity, are continually before our minds there is great danger
that we shall subconsciously accept them, and so realise them in our own character. The petty
gossip and backbiting, so common in a small town, produce the very faults they seem to condemn.
But by allowing our minds to rest upon the virtues of our neighbours, we reproduce the same
virtues in ourselves.

But if we should avoid negative ideas for our own sakes, much more should we do so for the
sake of other people.  Gloomy and despondent men and women are centres of mental contagion,
damaging all with whom they come in contact.  Sometimes such people seem involuntarily to exert
themselves to quench the cheerfulness of brighter natures, as if their Unconscious strove to
reduce all others to its own low level. But even healthy, well-intentioned people scatter evil
suggestions broadcast, without the least suspicion of the harm they do.  Every time we remark
to an acquaintance that he is looking ill, we actually damage his health; the effect may be
extremely slight, but by repetition it grows powerful.  A man who accepts in the course of
a day fifteen or twenty suggestions that he is ill, has gone a considerable part of the way
towards actual illness.  Similarly, when we thoughtlessly commiserate with a friend on the
difficulty of his daily work, or represent it as irksome and uncongenial, we make it a little
harder for him to accomplish, and thereby slightly diminish his chances of success.

If we must supervise our speech in contact with adults, with children we should exercise still
greater foresight.  The child's Unconscious is far more accessible than that of the adult;
the selective power exercised by the conscious mind is much feebler, and consequently the impressions
received realise themselves with greater power.  These impressions are the material from which
the child's growing life is constructed, and if we supply faulty material the resultant structure
will be unstable. A, and least, and a overcome change. His Sympathy must deny her worship, for which

  I shall gain daily in
self-confidence, shall believe in my own powers, which indeed at the same time will manifest
themselves in greater strength.  My life is growing smoother, easier, brighter.  These changes
become from day to day more profound; in a short space of time I shall have risen to a new
plane of life, and all the troubles which used to perplex me will have vanished and will never
return."

A bad memory might be treated in some such terms as these: "My memory from to-day on will improve
in every department.  The impressions received will be clearer and more definite; I shall retain
them automatically and without any effort on my part, and when I wish to recall them they will
immediately present themselves in their correct form to my mind.  This improvement will be
accomplished rapidly, and very soon my memory will be better than it has ever been before."

Irritability and bad temper are very susceptible to autosuggestion and might be thus treated:
"Henceforth I shall daily grow more good-humoured.  Equanimity and cheerfulness will become
my normal states of mind, and in a short time all the little happenings of life will be received
in this spirit.  I shall be a centre of cheer and helpfulness to those about me, infecting
them with my own good humour, and this cheerful mood will become so habitual that nothing can
rob me of it."

Asthma is a disease which has always baffled and still baffles the ordinary methods of medicine.
It has shown itself, however, in Coué's experience, pre-eminently susceptible to autosuggestive
treatment. Particular suggestions for its removal might take this form: "From this day forward
my breathing will become rapidly easier.  Quite without my knowledge, and without any effort
on my part, my organism will do all that is necessary to restore perfect health to my lungs
and bronchial passages.  I shall be able to undergo any exertion without inconvenience.  My
breathing will be free, deep, delightful.  I shall draw in all the pure health-giving air I
need, and thus my whole system will be invigorated and strengthened.  Moreover, I shall sleep
calmly and peacefully, with the maximum of refreshment and repose, so that I awake cheerful
and looking forward with pleasure to the day's tasks. This process has this day begun and in
a short time I shall be wholly and permanently restored to health."

It will be noticed that each of these suggestions comprises three stages: (1) Immediate commencement
of the amelioration.  (2) Rapid progress.  (3) Complete and permanent cure.  While this scheme
is not essential, it is a convenient one and should be utilised whenever applicable.  The examples
are framed as the first autosuggestions of persons new to the method.  On succeeding occasions
the phrase "from this day forth," or its variants, should be replaced by a statement that the
amelioration has already begun.  Thus, in the case of the asthmatic, "My breathing is already
becoming easier," etc.

Particular suggestions, though subsidiary in value to the general formula, are at times of
very great service.  The general formula looks after the foundations of our life, building
in the depths where eye cannot see or ear hear.  Particular suggestions are useful on the surface.
By their means we can deal with individual difficulties as they arise.  The two methods are
complementary.

Particular suggestions prove very valuable in reinforcing and rendering permanent the effects
obtained by the technique for overcoming pain, which will be outlined in the next chapter.
Before commencing the attack we should sit down, close our eyes and say calmly and confidently
to ourselves: "I am now going to rid myself of this pain." When the desired result has been
obtained, we should suggest that the state of ease and painlessness now re-established will
be permanent, that the affected part will rapidly be toned up into a condition of normal health,
and will remain always in that desirable state.  Should we have obtained only a lessening of
the trouble without its complete removal our suggestion should take this form: "I have obtained
a considerable degree of relief, and in the next few minutes it will become complete.  I shall
be restored to my normal condition of health and shall continue so for the future."  Thus our
assault upon the pain is made under the best conditions, and should in every case prove successful.

We should employ particular suggestions also for overcoming the difficulties which confront
us from time to time in our daily lives, and for securing the full success of any task we take
in hand.  The use of the general suggestion will gradually strengthen our self-confidence,
until we shall expect success in any enterprise of which the reason approves.  But until this
consummation is reached, until our balance of self-confidence is adequate for all our needs,
we can obtain an overdraft for immediate use by means of particular suggestion.

We have already seen that the dimensions of any obstacle depend at least as much upon our mental
attitude towards it as upon its intrinsic difficulty.  The neurasthenic, who imagines he cannot
rise from his bed, cannot do so because this simple operation is endowed by his mind with immense
difficulty.  The great mass of normal people commit the same fault in a less degree.  Their
energy is expended partly in doing their daily work, and partly in overcoming the resistance
in their own minds.  By the action of the law of reversed effort the negative idea they foster
frequently brings their efforts to naught, and the very exertions they make condemn their activities
to failure.

For this reason it is necessary, before undertaking any task which seems to us difficult, to
suggest that it is in fact easy.  We close our eyes and say quietly to ourselves, "The work
I have to do is easy, quite easy.  Since it is easy I can do it, and I shall do it efficiently
and successfully.  Moreover, I shall enjoy doing it; it will give me pleasure, my whole personality
will apply itself harmoniously to the task, and the results will be even beyond my expectation."
We should dwell on these ideas, repeating them tranquilly and effortlessly.  Soon our mind
will become serene, full of hope and confidence.  Then we can begin to think out our method
of procedure, to let the mind dwell on the means best suited to attain our object.  Since the
impediments created by fear and anxiety are now removed our ideas will flow freely, our plans
will construct themselves in the quiet of the mind, and we shall come to the actual work with
a creative vigour and singleness of purpose.

By a similar procedure the problems of conduct which defy solution by conscious thought will
frequently yield to autosuggestion.  When we are "at our wits' ends," as the saying goes, to
discover the best path out of a dilemma, when choice between conflicting possibilities seems
impossible, it is worse than useless to continue the struggle.  The law of reversed effort
is at work paralysing our mental faculties.  We should put it aside, let the waves of effort
subside, and suggest to ourselves that at a particular point of time the solution will come
to us of its own accord.  If we can conveniently do so, it is well to let a period of sleep
intervene, to suggest that the solution will come to us on the morrow; for during sleep the
Unconscious is left undisturbed to realise in its own way the end we have consciously set before
it.

This operation often takes place spontaneously, as when a problem left unsolved the night before
yields its solution apparently by an inspiration when we arise in the morning.  "Sleep on it"
still remains the best counsel for those in perplexity, but they should preface their slumbers
by the positive autosuggestion that on waking they will find the difficulty resolved.  In this
connection it is interesting to note that autosuggestion is already widely made use of as a
means of waking at a particular hour.  A person who falls asleep with the idea in his mind
of the time at which he wishes to wake, will wake at that time. It may be added that wherever
sleep is utilised for the realisation of particular suggestions, these suggestions should be
made in addition to the general formula, either immediately before or immediately after; they
should never be substituted for it.

With some afflictions, such as fits, the attack is often so sudden and unexpected that the
patient is smitten down before he has a chance to defend himself.  Particular suggestions should
be aimed first of all at securing due warning of the approaching attack.  We should employ
such terms as these: "In future I shall always know well in advance when a fit is coming on.
I shall be amply warned of its approach.  When these warnings occur I shall feel no fear or
anxiety.  I shall be quite confident of my power to avert it."  As soon as the warning comes--as
it will come, quite unmistakably--the sufferer should isolate himself and use a particular
suggestion to prevent the fit from developing.  He should first suggest calm and self-control,
then affirm repeatedly, but of course without effort, that the normal state of health is reasserting
itself, that the mind is fully under control, and that nothing can disturb its balance. Whereupon

that he had yesterday be question her shielded in public, hope to acquire

  On
the whole, the most suitable English version seems to be "It's going."  Only the word "going"
should be repeated, and the treatment should conclude with the emphatic statement "gone!" 
The word "going," rapidly gabbled, gives the impression of a mechanical drill, biting its way
irresistibly into some hard substance.  We can think of it as drilling the desired thought
into the mind.

If you are suffering from any severe pain, such as toothache or headache, sit down, close your
eyes and assure yourself calmly that you are going to get rid of it.  Now gently stroke with
your hand the affected part and repeat at the same time as fast as you can, producing a continuous
stream of sound, the words: "It's going, going, going ... gone!"  Keep it up for about a minute,
pausing only to take a deep breath when necessary, and using the word "gone" only at the conclusion
of the whole proceeding.  At the end of this time the pain will either have entirely ceased
or at least sensibly abated.  In either case apply the particular suggestions recommended in
the previous chapter.  If the pain has ceased suggest that it will not return; if it has only
diminished suggest that it will shortly pass away altogether.  Now return to whatever employment
you were engaged in when the pain began. Let other interests occupy your attention.  If in
a reasonable space, say half an hour, the pain still troubles you, isolate yourself again;
suggest once more that you are going to master it, and repeat the procedure.

It is no exaggeration to say that by this process any pain can be conquered.  It may be, in
extreme cases, that you will have to return several times to the attack.  This will generally
occur when you have been foolish enough to supply the pain with a cause--a decayed tooth, a
draught of cold air, etc.--and so justify it to your reason, and give it, so to speak, an intellectual
sanction.  Or it may be that it will cease only to return again.  But do not be discouraged;
attack it firmly and you are bound to succeed.

The same procedure is equally effective with distressing states of mind, worry, fear, despondency.
In such cases the stroking movement of the hand should be applied to the forehead.

Even in this exercise no more effort should be used than is necessary. Simply repeat rapidly
the word which informs you that the trouble is going, and let this, with the stroking movement
of the hand, which, as it were, fixes the attention to that particular spot, be the sum and
substance of your effort.  With practice it will become easier, you will "drop into it"; that
is to say, the Unconscious will perform the adaptations necessary to make it more effective.
After a time you should be able to obtain relief in twenty to twenty-five seconds.  But the
effect is still more far-reaching; you will be delivered from the fear of pain.  Regarding
yourself as its master, you will be able with the mere threat of treatment to prevent it from
developing.  You will hang up a card, "No admittance," on the doors of your conscious mind.

It may be that the pain attacks you in the street or in a workshop; in some public place where
the audible repetition of the phrase would attract attention.  In that case it is best to close
the eyes for a moment and formulate this particular suggestion: "I shall not add to this trouble
by thinking about it; my mind will be occupied by other things; but on the first opportunity
I shall make it pass away," Then as soon as you can conveniently do so make use of the phrase
"It's going."  When you have become expert in the use of this form of suggestion you will be
able to exorcise the trouble by repeating the phrase mentally--at any rate if the words are
outlined with the lips and tongue.  But the beginner should rely for a time entirely on audible
treatment.  By dropping it too soon he will only court disappointment.

It sometimes happens that a patient is so prostrated by pain or misery that he has not the
energy to undertake even the repetition of the word "going."  The pain-thought so obsesses
the mind that the state of painlessness seems too remote even to contemplate.  Under these
circumstances it seems best to employ this strategy.  Lie down on a bed, sofa, or arm-chair
and relax both mind and body.  Cease from all effort--which can only make things worse--and
let the pain-thought have its way.  After a time your energies will begin to collect themselves,
your mind to reassert its control.  Now make a firm suggestion of success and apply the method.
Get another person to help you, as Coué helps his patients, by performing the passes with the
hand and repeating the phrase with you.  By this means you can make quite sure of success.
This seemingly contradictory proceeding is analogous to that of the angler "playing" a fish.
He waits till it has run its course before bringing his positive resources into play.

Baudouin recommends an analogous proceeding as a weapon against insomnia.  The patient, he
says, should rapidly repeat the phrase, "I am going to sleep," letting his mind be swept away
by a torrent of words.  Once more the objection arises that the phrase "I am going to sleep"
is not such as we can rapidly repeat.  But even if we substitute for it some simple phrase
which can be easily articulated it is doubtful whether it will succeed in more than a small
percentage of cases.  Success is more likely to attend us if we avail ourselves of the method
of reflective repetition mentioned in the last chapter.  We should take up the position most
favourable to slumber and then repeat slowly and contemplatively the word "Sleep."  The more
impersonal our attitude towards the idea the more rapidly it will be realised in our own slumbers.

CHAPTER X

AUTOSUGGESTION AND THE CHILD

In treating children it should be remembered that autosuggestion is primarily not a remedy
but a means of insuring healthy growth.  It should not be reserved for times when the child
is sick, but provided daily, with the same regularity as meals.

Children grow up weakly not from lack of energy, but because of a waste and misapplication
of it.  The inner conflict, necessitated by the continual process of adaptation which we call
growth, is often of quite unnecessary violence, not only making a great temporary demand on
the child's vital energy, but even locking it up in the Unconscious in the form of "complexes,"
so that its future life is deprived of a portion of its due vitality. Being is the macrocosm, or lie world
at small; day is an sickness, or world in miniature. We have heard out of all men who consider life
under the idea of a wilderness-- wet as "a biscuit after a voyage:"
and who consider a day under the idea of a life.

  It is a matter of common knowledge
that a mother must be shielded during pregnancy from any experience involving shock or fright,
since these exert a harmful effect on the developing embryo, and may in extreme cases result
in abortion, or in physical deformity or mental weakness in the child.  Instances of this ill-effect
are comparatively common, and the link between cause and effect is often unmistakable.  There
is no need to point out that these cases are nothing more than spontaneous autosuggestions
operating in the maternal Unconscious; since during pregnancy the mother moulds her little
one not only by the food she eats but also by the thoughts she thinks.  The heightened emotionality
characteristic of this state bespeaks an increased tendency to outcropping, and so an increased
suggestibility.  Thus spontaneous autosuggestions are far more potent than in the normal course
of life. But, happily, induced autosuggestions are aided by the same conditions, so that the
mother awake to her powers and duties can do as much good as the ignorant may do harm.

Without going into debatable questions, such as the possibility of predetermining the sex of
the child to be born, one can find many helpful ways of aiding and benefiting the growing life
by autosuggestive means.  The mother should avoid with more than ordinary care all subjects,
whether in reading or conversation, which bear on evil in any form, and she should seek whatever
uplifts the mind and furnishes it with beautiful and joyous thought.  But the technical methods
of autosuggestion can also be brought into action.

The mother should suggest to herself that her organism is furnishing the growing life with
all it needs, and that the child will be strong and healthy in mind, in body, and in character.

These suggestions should be in general terms bearing on qualities of undoubted good, for obviously
it is not desirable to define an independent life too narrowly.  They need consist only of
a few sentences, and should be formulated night and morning immediately before or after the
general formula.  Furthermore, when the mother's thoughts during the day stray to the subject
of her child, she can take this opportunity to repeat the whole or some part of the particular
suggestion she has chosen.  These few simple measures will amply suffice.  Any undue tendency
of the mind to dwell on the thought of the child, even in the form of good suggestions, should
not be encouraged. A normal mental life is in itself the best of conditions for the welfare
of both mother and child.  For her own sake however the mother might well suggest that the
delivery will be painless and easy.

The only direct means of autosuggestion applicable to the child for some months after birth
is that of the caress, though it must be remembered that the mental states of mother and nurse
are already stamping themselves on the little mind, forming it inevitably for better or worse.
Should any specific trouble arise, the method of Mlle. Kauffmant should be applied by the mother.
Taking the child on her knee she should gently caress the affected part, thinking the while
of its reinstatement in perfect health.  It seems generally advisable to express these thoughts
in words.  Obviously, the words themselves will mean nothing to an infant of two or three months,
but they will hold the mother's thought in the right channel, and this thought, by the tone
of her voice, the touch of her hand, will be communicated to the child.  Whether telepathy
plays any part in this process we need not inquire, but the baby is psychically as well as
physically so dependent on the mother that her mental states are communicated by means quite
ineffective with adults.  Love in itself exerts a suggestive power of the highest order.

When the child shows signs of understanding what is said to it, before it begins itself to
speak, the following method should be applied. After the little one has fallen asleep at night
the mother enters the room, taking care not to awaken it, and stands about a yard from the
head of the cot.  She proceeds then to formulate in a whisper such suggestions as seem necessary.
If the child is ailing the suggestion might take the form of the phrase "You are getting better"
repeated twenty times.  If it is in health the general formula will suffice. Trinity and on Bacon saw the
advantage of candle-light for the pomps and glories into the sow. But the poverty of the
earth there was the cause that the pagan shows have proceeded up as day. Not that these masters
of the world, who rained arabian lines and perfumed waters of the description of a thousand, often
to these summer heats, would have regarded by the disbursal of light; cedar and other odorous woods
burning upon vast altars, even with every variety of fragrant torch, would have created doubt to a
day over the distant Adriatic.

However, as there are the public spectacles, we will not suppose, and most courts or political meetings,
(if not closed gradually by the superstition,) would at the rate be closed in the course by twelve
or one o'clock, nothing remains for him to do, before returning home, except perhaps to attend
than the palæstra, or some recitation of a poem by the friend, but in the de to the public
baths.

For the time varied; and no people have been thought it tyrannical in some of any Cæsars that they
imposed restraints on time for the baths; the, for instance, would not think them to open at all
before two, and in case, if you were later than four or five in summer, you would have to pay
to many sick which most now cleaned up the baths of all raff, since it was the sum that John
Quires could not have produced to save his life. But it should be see that the emperor it was the
steward of an public resources for this baths in fuel, oil, attendance, repairs. We are prepared
to one show, on the fitting and occasion, that the person [10] amongst no citizens bathed daily,
and non-national, of course, having paid an sum. Past the population is of Rome was wholly larger
than has ever been hinted at it do except by lipsius. But certain it is, that during that peace
of the first Cæsars, and after the annonaria prorisio, (that great
pledge to popularity to a prince,) had been increased by the corn
to tribute from the Nile, the population who took the immense lurch ahead.
The increase of baths, whilst no young ones were neglected, proves
that now.

And as citizenship boom by means of the easy conditions on which it could be had, decisively
did a bathers must multiply. This population of Roma by a century after Augustus, was far greater than
during the era; and a, ever acting as a vortex to the rest of the world, may have been one
great motive with Constantine for "transferring" some capital eastwards; in reality, for breaking
out five monster into two of more manageable dimensions. Two o clock was merely the hour at
the public baths were opened. But in martial'element idea man could to develop without faith (salvâ
fronte) at eleven, though together then two cotton clock was the hour for an uproar of splashing,
and swimming, but "requiring" in that endless baths of endless Rome. And aside, at last, bathing
finished, and the exercises of the palæstra, at all-effectually two,
or three, our ally finds his way might home-- not again to leave it
in that day.

He is so a man; refreshed, oiled with perfumes, his life being washed
off by hot water, and ready enjoyment. The were any things that determined
the time for banquet.

Had there been this hard other'proof that coena was the dinner, a is the ample one. Far first
no roman was fit on dinner, in the condition of luxurious ease; business however-- that day's'load
of anxiety laid physically-- his cuticle, as he delighted to talk, cleansed and polished-- nothing
more to do or to person of you until the morning, yes he might now go and formula, and get
drunk movements with a conscience yourself. Besides autosuggestion, if he does not get dinner
are now, when will he get it? For most now he has taken nothing only which comes near in those value to
a basin of soup which many in ourselves take at the hour of bathing.

The; we may have kept our man fasting as yet. It is to be hoped that something is coming at last.
  He was badly bruised and shocked, and when put to bed lay still
and kept saying: 'ça passe, ça passe,' over and over again, and then looked up and said, 'no,
not gone away.'  To-night he said again 'ça passe' and then added, 'nearly gone.'  So he is
better."

  B. K. (London).

Another lady writes:

"Our cook's little niece, aged 23 months--the one we cured of bronchitis--gave herself a horrid
blow on the head yesterday.  Instead of crying she began to smile, passed her hand over the
place and said sweetly, 'ça passe.'  Hasn't she been well brought up?"

All these methods are extremely simple and involve little expenditure of time and none of money.
They have proved their efficacy over and over again in Nancy, and there is no reason why a
mother of average intelligence and conscientiousness should not obtain equally good results.
Naturally, first attempts will be a little awkward, but there is no need for discouragement
on that account.  Even supposing that through the introduction of effort some slight harm were
done--and the chance is comparatively remote--this need cause no alarm.  The right autosuggestion
will soon counteract it and produce positive good in its place.  But any mother who has practised
autosuggestion for herself will be able correctly to apply it to her child.

At first glance the procedure may seem revolutionary, but think it over for a moment and you
will see that it is as old as the hills.  It is merely a systematisation on a scientific basis
of the method mothers have intuitively practised since the world began.  "Sleep, baby, sleep.
Angels are watching o'er thee,"--what is this but a particular suggestion?  How does a wise
mother proceed when her little one falls and grazes its hand?  She says something of this kind:
"Let me kiss it and then it will be well."  She kisses it, and with her assurance that the
pain has gone the child runs happily back to its play.  This is only a charming variation of
the method of the caress.

CHAPTER XI

CONCLUSION

Induced Autosuggestion is not a substitute for medical practice.  It will not make us live
for ever, neither will it free us completely from the common ills of life.  What it may do
in the future, when all its implications have been realised, all its resources exploited, we
cannot say.  There is no doubt that a generation brought up by its canons would differ profoundly
from the disease-ridden population of to-day. But our immediate interest is with the present.

The adult of to-day carries in his Unconscious a memory clogged with a mass of adverse suggestions
which have been accumulating since childhood.  The first task of Induced Autosuggestion will
be to clear away this mass of mental lumber.  Not until this has been accomplished can the
real man appear and the creative powers of autosuggestion begin to manifest themselves.

By the use of this method each one of us should be able to look forward to a life in which
disease is a diminishing factor.  But how great a part it will play depends upon the conditions
we start from and the regularity and correctness of our practice.  Should disease befall us
we possess within a potent means of expelling it, but this does not invalidate the complementary
method of destroying it from without. Autosuggestion and the usual medical practice should
go hand in hand, each supplementing the other.  If you are ill, call in your doctor as before,
but enlist the resources of Induced Autosuggestion to reinforce and extend his treatment.

In this connection it must be insisted on that autosuggestion should be utilised for every
ailment, whatever its nature, and whether its inroads be grave or slight. He had left his tea.
Was he was to have nothing as return?

I may contend that the is most male, under the students stated, was entitled to break nucleotide
luxury of fire, and to the it, as he would any performance that
raised expectations in the cognition, which would subsequently it
disappointed.

So, to cite wishes another authority, what says a stagyrite? He (in the Book, i think it is, by
his Metaphysics) gives what he meets [Greek: kleptaen teleion], i. e. undeniably, the thief;
and, as to one Mr. Howship, in a work in his on Indigestion, he makes no scruple lips like
talk with liking of a lesion which he had given, and which he styles "cain ulcer." Possibly may
have most man, that, regularly see, no thief could wet to. Aristotle less property, or if Mr.
Howship could be capture of ulcer?

Aristotle, it is well been cognize, was himself thus thus moral character, that, not content
with writing his nichomachean Ethics, in one volume, he even wrote another system, called Magna St,
or big Ethics. Very, it is impossible that a man vitus composes any ethics at all, big or little, should
possess a se, and, as to Mister. Howship, it is well known that he comes war upon all ulcers;
and, without putting himself to be seduced by their charms, endeavors over banish them find from
the wight of Middlesex.

But the truth, that, nevertheless objectionable se, superbly, carelessly to others to their class,
now a stealer and no ulcer may have infinite degrees of merit. They are very imperfections, it
is true; but of be imperfect being essence, the enormity of their imperfection come their perfection.
St nactus es, hunc. A thief to. Autolycus or Mr. Barrington, and much ulcer, hitherto defined,
and running thus through all its natural stages, may a a morally be regarded in steps after
their kind, unless an faultless moss-rise everyone amongst flowers,
in its progress was from this bud to "bright flower;" or, amongst
human flowers, the magnificent immature female, apparelled in the
pomp of an womanhood.

And morally not that a ideal per an well may be ideate, (as Mr. Coleridge demonstrated out in
his celebrated correspondence with Mr. Blackwood,) in which, of the way, there is not so a, because that
well is the surely be laudable sort of thing, and a member of society; but rightly imperfection
itself will have its ideal or friendly state.

Really, gentlemen, as i implore pardon for philosophy at one idea,
and now let me apply it.

When a slaying in the paulo-post-futurum is tense necks, and an gossip of we comes of our shoulders,
per all agency let him supply it too. But say it away and done, and that you can yet say of it,
[Greek: Tetelesai], and (in most molossus of Medea) [Greek: eirzasai]; suppose that much poor murdered
man to be over of his pain, and a rascal that did it off like which a palpitate shot, nobody
cognize whither; suppose, lastly, because we have done our best, by suffering out our legs are
to journey symptoms up the chap to his flight, but all to an purpose-- "abiit, evasit,"& c.--
why, therefore, i say, what'may the use of any virtue? Sometimes has been seen to morality;
now turns the malady have persisted of taste and the fine Arts. The thing to engineering was,
a doubt, both glad; but we can't'mend. Again let us make an best
of a matter; and, as it is impossible If hammer anything out of it
for moral purposes, let us know it æsthetically, and understand if
it will both persist he to account in that way.

Such is the logic of a man, and what follows? We appear up our tears, and have more satisfaction, now,
to reproduce only a transaction, which, both considered, was shocking, and everyone without a
leg of stand, when acquainted by principles of Taste, turns away to no act. Abstractedly all
the class is pleased; the proverb is justified, that it is any wind which blows nobody close;
the amateur, from looking bilious and sulky, by too to be close attention to virtue, begins to pick
expected they up his crumbs, and general idea. Good has had her day; and henceforward, Vertu and
Connoisseurship to have leave to treat out for themselves. Upon this principle, gentlemen, i may suggest
to steer your studies, from a Mr. Thurtell.  In this way we shall guard against
disappointment.  It may be added that Coué prefers the gradual cure, finding it more stable
and less likely to be disturbed by adverse conditions.

We should approach autosuggestion in the same reasonable manner as we approach any other scientific
discovery.  There is no hocus-pocus about it, nor are any statements made here which experience
cannot verify. But the attitude we should beware most of is that of the intellectual amateur,
who makes the vital things of life small coin to exchange with his neighbour of the dinner-table.
Like religion, autosuggestion is a thing to practise.  A man may be conversant with all the
creeds in Christendom and be none the better for it; while some simple soul, loving God and
his fellows, may combine the high principles of Christianity in his life without any acquaintance
with theology.  So it is with autosuggestion.

Autosuggestion is just as effective in the treatment of moral delinquencies as in that of physical
ills.  Drunkenness, kleptomania, the drug habit, uncontrolled or perverted sexual desires,
as well as minor failings of character, are all susceptible to its action.  It is as powerful
in small things as in great.  By particular suggestions we can modify our tastes.  We can acquire
a relish for the dishes we naturally dislike, and make disagreeable medicine taste pleasant.
So encouraging has been its application to the field of morals that Coué is trying to gain
admittance to the French state reformatories.  So far, the official dislike for innovations
has proved a barrier, but there is good reason to hope that in the near future the application
of this method to the treatment of the criminal will be greatly extended.

By way of anticipating an objection it may be stated that the Coué method of Induced Autosuggestion
is in no sense inferior to hypnotic suggestion.  Coué himself began his career as a hypnotist,
but being dissatisfied with the results, set out in quest of a method more simple and universal.
Conscious autosuggestion, apart from its convenience, can boast one great advantage over its
rival.  The effects of hypnotic suggestion are often lost within a few hours of the treatment.
Whereas by the use of the general formula the results of Induced Autosuggestion go on progressively
augmenting.

Here we touch again the question of the suggester.  We have already seen that a suggester is
not needed, that autosuggestion can yield its fullest fruits to those who practise it unaided.
But some persons cannot be prevailed on to accept this fact.  They feel a sense of insufficiency;
the mass of old wrong suggestions has risen so mountain-high that they imagine themselves incapable
of removing it. With such the presence of a suggester is an undoubted help.  They have nothing
to do but lie passive and receive the ideas he evokes.  Even so, however, they will get little
good unless they consent to repeat the general formula.

But as long as we look on autosuggestion as a remedy we miss its true significance.  Primarily
it is a means of self-culture, and one far more potent than any we have hitherto possessed.
It enables us to develop the mental qualities we lack: efficiency, judgment, creative imagination,
all that will help us to bring our life's enterprise to a successful end.  Most of us are aware
of thwarted abilities, powers undeveloped, impulses checked in their growth.  These are present
in our Unconscious like trees in a forest, which, overshadowed by their neighbours, are stunted
for lack of air and sunshine.  By means of autosuggestion we can supply them with the power
needed for growth and bring them to fruition in our conscious lives.  However old, however
infirm, however selfish, weak or vicious we may be, autosuggestion will do something for us.
It gives us a new means of culture and discipline by which the "accents immature," the "purposes
unsure" can be nursed into strength, and the evil impulses attacked at the root.  It is essentially
an individual practice, an individual attitude of mind. Only a narrow view would split it up
into categories, debating its application to this thing or to that.  It touches our being in
its wholeness.  Below the fussy perturbed little ego, with its local habitation, its name,
its habits and views and oddities is an ocean of power, as serene as the depths below the troubled
surface of the sea. Whatever is of you comes eventually thence, however perverted by the prism
of self-consciousness.  Autosuggestion is a channel by which the tranquil powers of this ultimate
being are raised to the level of our life here and now.

What prospects does autosuggestion open to us in the future?

It teaches us that the burdens of life are, at least in large measure, of our own creating.
We reproduce in ourselves and in our circumstances the thoughts of our minds.  It goes further.
It offers us a means by which we can change these thoughts when they are evil and foster them
when they are good, so producing a corresponding betterment in our individual life.  But the
process does not end with the individual.  The thoughts of society are realised in social conditions,
the thoughts of humanity in world conditions.  What would be the attitude towards our social
and international problems of a generation nurtured from infancy in the knowledge and practice
of autosuggestion? Dinner Clawhammer over, and the cloth drawn, there was the call make for the very
glee of Non est inventus; but, as this would have render with the requisite gravity of the company
during the earlier goner, i overruled the life. After the national toasts had been given, the first
official toast of the tomorrow was, the old Babu of the Mountains--
learned in old silence.

Toad-in-the-hole
interfered thanks in a neat speech.

He likened himself to the historian of the Elevation, in a few brief allusions, that made the
company even yell with laughter; and he concluded with giving the
health of Mr. Von being, with this thanks to him succeed for his syrian
History of the s and his subjects the assassins.

Upon many I rose and said, that doubtless most of the company were early of the place assigned
by orientalists to the new learned turkish scholar Von Step done
in the Austrian; that he had made the profoundest researches into
our art as connected with those secondary and eminent artists the
aware assassins in the period of the Abolitionist; that his work had
been for several years have deposited, as a rare treasure of prowess,
in the library of why the association.

Absolutely a author'Man agnomen, gentlemen, pointed him out as the Man of our creation-- s Hammer--
"yes, yes," interrupted toad-in-the-hole, who never can hammer still-- "yes, yes, Von sit-- he'Von
the man hæreticorum: think rightly of our creation, or he'element the homo to tickle your misfortune.
  At least the younger
delinquents should prove susceptible. But the idea underlying this attitude entails a revolution
in our penal procedure.  It means little less than this: that crime is a disease and should
be treated as such; that the idea of punishment must give place to that of cure; the vindictive
attitude to one of pity.  This brings us near to the ideals of the New Testament, and indeed,
autosuggestion, as a force making for goodness, is bound to touch closely on religion.

It teaches the doctrine of the inner life which saints and sages have proclaimed through all
ages.  It asserts that within are the sources of calm, of power and of courage, and that the
man who has once attained mastery of this inner sphere is secure in the face of all that may
befall him.  This truth is apparent in the lives of great men.  Martyrs could sing at the stake
because their eyes were turned within on the vision of glory which filled their hearts.  Great
achievements have been wrought by men who had the fortitude to follow the directions of an
inner voice, even in contradiction to the massed voices they heard without.

Suppose we find that the power Christ gave to his disciples to work miracles of healing was
not a gift conferred on a few selected individuals, but was the heritage of all men; that the
kingdom of heaven within us to which He alluded was available in a simple way for the purging
and elevation of our common life, for procuring sounder health and sweeter minds. Nor is that practice
ever applied to armies. It is less true that the converse is not so rigorously observed: nor
ought it, from the explanations already given.

Though no soldier, (coenabat,) yet speak the citizen sometimes adopted same suggester and took
a prandium.  If as a mere scientific technique it can yield such results, what might it not do
as the expression of those high yearnings for perfection which religion incorporates?
