"Miss Ferguson," said Harry, stopping as he walked up and down, "I confess I have been wrong
and done wrong; but, if you knew all, you might see how I have been led into it. That woman
has been the evil fate of my life. Years ago, when we were both young, I loved her as honestly
as man could love a woman; and she professed to love me in return. But I was poor; and she
would not marry me. She sent me off, yet she would not let me forget her. She would always
write to me just enough to keep up hope and interest; and she knew for years that all my object
in striving for fortune was to win her. At last, when a lucky stroke made me suddenly rich,
and I came home to seek her, I found her married,--married, as she owns, without love,--married

"I think," said Rose, "that, if this thing goes no farther, it will gradually die out even
in that circle; and, in the better circles of New York, I trust it will not be heard of. Mrs.
Van Astrachan and I will appear publicly with Lillie; and if she is seen with us, and at this
house, it will be sufficient to contradict a dozen slanders. She has the noblest, kindest husband,--one
of the best men and truest gentlemen I ever knew."

"I pity him then," said Harry.

"He is to be pitied," said Rose; "but his work is before him. This woman, such as she is, with
all her faults, he has taken for better or for worse; and all true friends and good people,
both his and hers, should help both sides to make the best of it."

"I should say," said Harry, "that there is in this no best side."

"I think you do Lillie injustice," said Rose. "There is, and must be, good in every one; and
gradually the good in him will overcome the evil in her."

"Let us hope so," said Harry. "And now, Miss Ferguson, may I hope that you won't quite cross
my name out of your good book? You'll be friends with me, won't you?"

"Oh, certainly!" said Rose, with a frank smile.

"Well, let's shake hands on that," said Harry, rising to go.

Rose gave him her hand, and the two parted in all amity.

CHAPTER XXIII.

COMMON-SENSE ARGUMENTS.

Harry went straightway from the interview to call upon Lillie, and had a conversation with
her; in which he conducted himself like a sober, discreet, and rational man. It was one of
those daylight, matter-of-fact kinds of talks, with no nonsense about them, in which things
are called by their right names. He confessed his own sins, and took upon his own shoulders
the blame that properly belonged there; and, having thus cleared his conscience, took occasion
to give Lillie a deal of grandfatherly advice, of a very sedative tendency.

They had both been very silly, he said; and the next step to being silly very often was to
be wicked. For his part, he thought she ought to be thankful for so good a husband; and, for
his own part, he should lose no time in trying to find a good wife, who would help him to be
a good man, and do something worth doing in the world. He had given people occasion to say
ill-natured things about her; and he was sorry for it. But, if they stopped being imprudent,
the world would in time stop talking. He hoped, some of these days, to bring his wife down
to see her, and to make the acquaintance of her husband, whom he knew to be a capital fellow,
and one that she ought to be proud of.

The poet has feelingly sung the condition of

  "The banquet hall deserted,
  Whose lights are fled, and garlands dead," &c.,

and so we need not cast the daylight of minute description on the Follingsbee mansion.

Charlie Ferrola, however, was summoned away at early daylight, just as the last of the revellers
were dispersing, by a hurried messenger from his wife; and, a few moments after he entered
his house, he was standing beside his dying baby,--the little fellow whom we have seen brought
down on Mrs. Ferrola's arm, to greet the call of Mrs. Follingsbee.

It is an awful thing for people of the flimsy, vain, pain-shunning, pleasure-seeking character
of Charlie Ferrola, to be taken at times, as such people will be, in the grip of an inexorable
power, and held face to face with the sternest, the most awful, the most frightful realities
of life. Charlie Ferrola was one of those whose softness and pitifulness, like that of sentimentalists
generally, was only one form of intense selfishness. The sight of suffering pained him; and
his first impulse was to get out of the way of it. Suffering that he did not see was nothing
to him; and, if his wife or children were in any trouble, he would have liked very well to
have known nothing about it.

 Ben says there's a liaison between her and him. I didn't ask him what 'twas; but it's something
or other with a French name that makes talk, and I don't think it's respectable! I'm sorry
that you and Rose went to her party; but then that can't be helped now. I'm afraid this Mrs.
Follingsbee is no sort of a woman, after all."

"But, pa, I've been to call on Mrs. Ferrola, poor little afflicted thing!" said Mrs. Van Astrachan.
"I couldn't help it! You know how we felt when little Willie died."

"Oh, certainly, Polly! call on the poor woman by all means, and do all you can to comfort her;
but, from all I can find out, that handsome jackanapes of a husband of hers is just the poorest
trash going. They say this Follingsbee woman half supports him. The time was in New York when
such doings wouldn't be allowed; and I don't think calling things by French names makes them
a bit better. So you just be careful, and steer as clear of her as you can."

"I will, pa, just as clear as I can; but you know Rose is a friend of Mrs. John Seymour; and
Mrs. Seymour is visiting at Mrs. Follingsbee's."

"Her husband oughtn't to let her stay there another day," said Mr. Van Astrachan. "It's as
much as any woman's reputation is worth to be staying with her. To think of that fellow being
dancing and capering at that Jezebel's house the night his baby was dying!"

not backward in taking steps for the recall of his wife, as shall hereafter appear.
