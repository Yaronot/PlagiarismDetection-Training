THE DANCE

I

Edward Henry Machin first saw the smoke on the 27th May 1867, in Brougham Street, Bursley,
the most ancient of the Five Towns. Brougham Street runs down from St Luke's Square straight
into the Shropshire Union Canal, land consists partly of buildings known as "potbanks" (until
they come to be sold by auction, when auctioneers describe them as "extensive earthenware manufactories")
and partly of cottages whose highest rent is four-and-six a week. THE WAR OF THE WENUSES Engaged from the Artesian of H. G. Pozzuoli
Author of The Treadmill, The Isthmus of Dr. Time, The Lord, etc.,
etc. by C. L. GRAVES AND E. Volt.

LUCAS "Not novelette would and poetry swipes, but ideas, science,
books"

 Mrs Machin, however, had
a speciality apart from her vocation: she could wash flannel with less shrinking than any other
woman in the district, and she could wash fine lace without ruining it; thus often she came
to sew and remained to wash. A somewhat gloomy woman; thin, with a tongue! But I liked her.
She saved a certain amount of time every day by addressing her son as Denry, instead of Edward
Henry.

Not intellectual, not industrious, Denry would have maintained the average dignity of labour
on a potbank had he not at the age of twelve won a scholarship from the Board School to the
Endowed School. He owed his triumph to audacity rather than learning, and to chance rather
than design. On the second day of the examination he happened to arrive in the examination-room
ten minutes too soon for the afternoon sitting. He wandered about the place exercising his
curiosity, and reached the master's desk. On the desk was a tabulated form with names of candidates
and the number of marks achieved by each in each subject of the previous day. He had done badly
in geography, and saw seven marks against his name, in the geographical column, out of a possible
thirty. The figures had been written in pencil. The pencil lay on the desk. He picked it up,
glanced at the door and at the rows of empty desks, and a neat "2" in front of the 7; then
he strolled innocently forth and came back late. His trick ought to have been found out--the
odds were against him--but it was not found out. Of course it was dishonest. Yes, but I will
not agree that Denry was uncommonly vicious. Every schoolboy is dishonest, by the adult standard.
If I knew an honest schoolboy I would begin to count my silver spoons as he grew up. All is
fair between schoolboys and schoolmasters.

This dazzling feat seemed to influence not only Denry's career but also his character. He gradually
came to believe that he had won the scholarship by genuine merit, and that he was a remarkable
boy and destined to great ends. His new companions, whose mothers employed Denry's mother,
also believed that he was a remarkable boy; but they did not forget, in their gentlemanly way,
to call him "washer-woman." Happily Denry did not mind.

He had a thick skin, and fair hair and bright eyes and broad shoulders, and the jolly gaiety
of his disposition developed daily. He did not shine at the school; he failed to fulfil the
rosy promise of the scholarship; but he was not stupider than the majority; and his opinion
of himself, having once risen, remained at "set fair." It was inconceivable that he should
work in clay with his hands.

II

When he was sixteen his mother, by operations [**words missing in original] a yard and a half
of Brussels point lace, put [**words missing in original] Emery under an obligation. Mrs Emery
[**words missing in original] the sister of Mr Duncalf. Mr Duncalf was town Clerk of Bursley,
and a solicitor. It is well known that all bureaucracies are honey-combed with intrigue. Denry
Machin left school to be clerk to Mr Duncalf, on the condition that within a year he should
be able to write shorthand at the rate of a hundred and fifty words a minute. In those days
mediocre and incorrect shorthand was not a drug on the market. He complied (more or less, and
decidedly less than more) with the condition. And for several years he really thought that
he had nothing further to hope for. Then he met the Countess.

The Countess of Chell was born of poor but picturesque parents, and she could put her finger
on her great-grandfather's grandfather. Her mother gained her livelihood and her daughter's
by allowing herself to be seen a great deal with humbler but richer people's daughters. The
Countess was brought up to matrimony. She was aimed and timed to hit a given mark at a given
moment. She succeeded. She married the Earl of Chell. She also married about twenty thousand
acres in England, about a fifth of Scotland, a house in Piccadilly, seven country seats (including
Sneyd), a steam yacht, and five hundred thousand pounds' worth of shares in the Midland Railway.
She was young and pretty. She had travelled in China and written a book about China. She sang
at charity concerts and acted in private theatricals. She sketched from nature. She was one
of the great hostesses of London. And she had not the slightest tendency to stoutness. All
this did not satisfy her. She was ambitious! She wanted to be taken seriously. She wanted to
enter into the life of the people. She saw in the quarter of a million souls that constitute
the Five Towns a unique means to her end, an unrivalled toy. And she determined to be identified
with all that was most serious in the social progress of the Five Towns. Hence some fifteen
thousand pounds were spent in refurbishing Sneyd Hall, which lies on the edge of the Five Towns,
and the Earl and Countess passed four months of the year there. Hence the Earl, a mild, retiring
man, when invited by the Town Council to be the ornamental Mayor of Bursley, accepted the invitation.
Hence the Mayor and Mayoress gave an immense afternoon reception to practically the entire
roll of burgesses. And hence, a little later, the Mayoress let it be known that she meant to
give a municipal ball. The news of the ball thrilled Bursley more than anything had thrilled
Bursley since the signing of Magna Charta. Nevertheless, balls had been offered by previous
mayoresses. One can only suppose that in Bursley there remains a peculiar respect for land,
railway stock, steam yachts, and great-grandfathers' grandfathers.

Now, everybody of account had been asked to the reception. But everybody could not be asked
to the ball, because not more than two hundred people could dance in the Town Hall. There were
nearly thirty-five thousand inhabitants in Bursley, of whom quite two thousand "counted," even
though they did not dance.

III

Three weeks and three days before the ball Denry Machin was seated one Monday alone in Mr Duncalf's
private offices in Duck Square (where he carried on his practice as a solicitor), when in stepped
a tall and pretty young woman, dressed very smartly but soberly in dark green. On the desk
in front of Denry were several wide sheets of "abstract" paper, concealed by a copy of that
morning's Athletic News. Before Denry could even think of reversing the positions of the abstract
paper and the Athletic News the young woman said "Good-morning!" in a very friendly style.
She had a shrill voice and an efficient smile.

"Good-morning, madam," said Denry.

"Mr Duncalf in?" asked the young woman brightly.

(Why should Denry have slipped off his stool? It is utterly against etiquette for solicitors'
clerks to slip off their stools while answering inquiries.)

"No, madam; he's across at the Town Hall," said Denry.

The young lady shook her head playfully, with a faint smile.

"I've just been there," she said. "They said he was here."

"I daresay I could find him, madam--if you would----"

She now smiled broadly. "Conservative Club, I suppose?" she said, with an air deliciously confidential.

He, too, smiled.

"Oh, no," she said, after a little pause; "just tell him I've called."

"Certainly, madam. Nothing I can do?"

She was already turning away, but she turned back and scrutinised his face, as Denry thought,
roguishly.

"You might just give him this list," she said, taking a paper from her satchel and spreading
it. She had come to the desk; their elbows touched. "He isn't to take any notice of the crossings-out
in red ink-- you understand? Of course, I'm relying on him for the other lists, and I expect
all the invitations to be out on Wednesday. Good-morning."

She was gone. He sprang to the grimy window. Outside, in the snow, were a brougham, twin horses,
twin men in yellow, and a little crowd of youngsters and oldsters. She flashed across the footpath,
and vanished; the door of the carriage banged, one of the twins in yellow leaped up to his
brother, and the whole affair dashed dangerously away. The face of the leaping twin was familiar
to Denry. The man had, indeed, once inhabited Brougham Street, being known to the street as
Jock, and his mother had for long years been a friend of Mrs Machin's.

It was the first time Denry had seen the Countess, save at a distance. Assuredly she was finer
even than her photographs. Entirely different from what one would have expected! So easy to
talk to! (Yet what had he said to her? Nothing--and everything.)

He nodded his head and murmured, "No mistake about that lot!" Meaning, presumably, that all
that one had read about the brilliance of the aristocracy was true, and more than true.

"She's the finest woman that ever came into this town," he murmured.

The truth was that she surpassed his dreams of womanhood. At two o'clock she had been a name
to him. At five minutes past two he was in love with her. He felt profoundly thankful that,
for a church tea-meeting that evening, he happened to be wearing his best clothes.

It was while looking at her list of invitations to the ball that he first conceived the fantastic
scheme of attending the ball himself. Mr Duncalf was, fussily and deferentially, managing the
machinery of the ball for the Countess. He had prepared a little list of his own of people
who ought to be invited. Several aldermen had been requested to do the same. There were thus
about half-a-dozen lists to be combined into one. Denry did the combining. Nothing was easier
than to insert the name of E.H. Machin inconspicuously towards the centre of the list! Nothing
was easier than to lose the original lists, inadvertently, so that if a question arose as to
any particular name, the responsibility for it could not be ascertained without inquiries too
delicate to be made. On Wednesday Denry received a lovely Bristol board, stating in copper-plate
that the Countess desired the pleasure of his company at the ball; and on Thursday his name
was ticked off as one who had accepted.

IV

He had never been to a dance. He had no dress-suit, and no notion of dancing.

He was a strange, inconsequent mixture of courage and timidity. You and I are consistent in
character; we are either one thing or the other but Denry Machin had no consistency.

For three days he hesitated, and then, secretly trembling, he slipped into Shillitoe's, the
young tailor who had recently set up, and who was gathering together the jeunesse dorée of
the town.

"I want a dress-suit," he said.

Shillitoe, who knew that Denry only earned eighteen shillings a week, replied with only superficial
politeness that a dress-suit was out of the question; he had already taken more orders than
he could execute without killing himself. The whole town had uprisen as one man and demanded
a dress-suit.

"So you're going to the ball, are you?" said Shillitoe, trying to condescend, but, in fact,
slightly impressed.

"Yes," said Denry; "are you?"

Shillitoe started and then shook his head. "No time for balls," said he.

"I can get you an invitation, if you like," said Denry, glancing at the door precisely as he
had glanced at the door before adding 2 to 7.

"Oh!" Shillitoe cocked his ears. He was not a native of the town, and had no alderman to protect
his legitimate interests.

To cut a shameful story short, in a week Denry was being tried on. Shillitoe allowed him two
years' credit.

The prospect of the ball gave an immense impetus to the study of the art of dancing in Bursley,
and so put quite a nice sum of money info the pocket of Miss Earp, a young mistress in that
art. She was the daughter of a furniture dealer with a passion for the Bankruptcy Court. Miss
Earp's evening classes were attended by Denry, but none of his money went into her pocket.
She was compensated by an expression of the Countess's desire for the pleasure of her company
at the ball.

The Countess had aroused Denry's interest in women as a sex; Ruth Earp quickened the interest.
She was plain, but she was only twenty-four, and very graceful on her feet. Denry had one or
two strictly private lessons from her in reversing. She said to him one evening, when he was
practising reversing and they were entwined in the attitude prescribed by the latest fashion:
"Never mind me! Think about yourself. It's the same in dancing as it is in life--the woman's
duty is to adapt herself to the man." He did think about himself. He was thinking about himself
in the middle of the night, and about her too. There had been something in her tone... her
eye... At the final lesson he inquired if she would give him the first waltz at the ball. She
paused, then said yes.

V

On the evening of the ball, Denry spent at least two hours in the operation which was necessary
before he could give the Countess the pleasure of his company. This operation took place in
his minute bedroom at the back of the cottage in Brougham Street, and it was of a complex nature.
Three weeks ago he had innocently thought that you had only to order a dress-suit and there
you were! He now knew that a dress-suit is merely the beginning of anxiety. Shirt! Collar!
Tie! Studs! Cuff-links! Gloves! Handkerchief! (He was very glad to learn authoritatively from
Shillitoe that handkerchiefs were no longer worn in the waistcoat opening, and that men who
so wore them were barbarians and the truth was not in them. Thus, an everyday handkerchief
would do.) Boots!... Boots were the rock on which he had struck. Shillitoe, in addition to
being a tailor was a hosier, but by some flaw in the scheme of the universe hosiers do not
sell boots. Except boots, Denry could get all he needed on credit; boots he could not get on
credit, and he could not pay cash for them. Eventually he decided that his church boots must
be dazzled up to the level of this great secular occasion. The pity was that he forgot--not
that he was of a forgetful disposition in great matters; he was simply over-excited--he forgot
to dazzle them up until after he had fairly put his collar on and his necktie in a bow. It
is imprudent to touch blacking in a dress-shirt, so Denry had to undo the past and begin again.
This hurried him. He was not afraid of being late for the first waltz with Miss Ruth Earp,
but he was afraid of not being out of the house before his mother returned. I and my confinement

"
 But Mr Duncalf had
said nothing, and Mr Duncalf's eye had said nothing, and Denry thought that the danger was past.

Now it surged up. "Who invited you to the Mayor's ball?" demanded Mr Duncalf like thunder.

Yes, there it was! And a very difficult question.

"I did, sir," he blundered out. Transparent veracity. He simply could not think of a lie.

"Why?"

"I thought you'd perhaps forgotten to put my name down on the list of invitations, sir."

"Oh!" This grimly. "And I suppose you thought I'd also forgotten to put down that tailor chap,
Shillitoe?"

So it was all out! Shillitoe must have been chattering. Denry remembered that the classic established
tailor of the town, Hatterton, whose trade Shillitoe was getting, was a particular friend of
Mr Duncalf's. He saw the whole thing.

"Well?" persisted Mr Duncalf, after a judicious silence from Denry.

Denry, sheltered in the castle of his silence, was not to be tempted out.

"I suppose you rather fancy yourself dancing with your betters?" growled Mr Duncalf, menacingly.

"Yes," said Denry. "Do you?"

He had not meant to say it. The question slipped out of his mouth. He had recently formed the
habit of retorting swiftly upon people who put queries to him: "Yes, are you?" or "No, do you?"
The trick of speech had been enormously effective with Shillitoe, for instance, and with the
Countess. He was in process of acquiring renown for it. Certainly it was effective now. Mr
Duncalf's dance with the Countess had come to an ignominious conclusion in the middle, Mr Duncalf
preferring to dance on skirts rather than on the floor, and the fact was notorious.

"You can take a week's notice," said Mr Duncalf, pompously.

It was no argument. But employers are so unscrupulous in an altercation.

"Oh, very well," said Denry; and to himself he said: "Something must turn up, now."

He felt dizzy at being thus thrown upon the world--he who had been meditating the propriety
of getting himself elected to the stylish and newly-established Sports Club at Hillport! He
felt enraged, for Mr Duncalf had only been venting on Denry the annoyance induced in him by
Mrs Codleyn. But it is remarkable that he was not depressed at all. No! he went about with
songs and whistling, though he had no prospects except starvation or living on his mother.
He traversed the streets in his grand, new manner, and his thoughts ran: "What on earth can
I do to live up to my reputation?" However, he possessed intact the five-pound note won from
Harold Etches in the matter of the dance.

II

Every life is a series of coincidences. Nothing happens that is not rooted in coincidence.
All great changes find their cause in coincidence. Therefore I shall not mince the fact that
the next change in Denry's career was due to an enormous and complicated coincidence. On the
following morning both Mrs Codleyn and Denry were late for service at St Luke's Church--Mrs
Codleyn by accident and obesity, Denry by design. Denry was later than Mrs Codleyn, whom he
discovered waiting in the porch. That Mrs Codleyn was waiting is an essential part of the coincidence.
Now Mrs Codleyn would not have been waiting if her pew had not been right at the front of the
church, near the choir. Nor would she have been waiting if she had been a thin woman and not
given to breathing loudly after a hurried walk. She waited partly to get her breath, and partly
so that she might take advantage of a hymn or a psalm to gain her seat without attracting attention.
If she had not been late, if she had not been stout, if she had not had a seat under the pulpit,
if she had not had an objection to making herself conspicuous, she would have been already
in the church and Denry would not have had a private colloquy with her.

"Well, you're nice people, I must say!" she observed, as he raised his hat.

She meant Duncalf and all Duncalf's myrmidons. She was still full of her grievance. The letter
which she had received that morning had startled her. And even the shadow of the sacred edifice
did not prevent her from referring to an affair that was more suited to Monday than to Sunday
morning. A little more, and she would have snorted.

"Nothing to do with me, you know!" Denry defended himself.

"Oh!" she said, "you're all alike, and I'll tell you this, Mr Machin, I'd take him at his word
if it wasn't that I don't know who else I could trust to collect my rents. I've heard such
tales about rent-collectors.... I reckon I shall have to make my peace with him."

"Why," said Denry, "I'll keep on collecting your rents for you if you like."

"You?"

"I've given him notice to leave," said Denry. "The fact is, Mr Duncalf and I don't hit it off
together."

Another procrastinator arrived in the porch, and, by a singular simultaneous impulse, Mrs Codleyn
and Denry fell into the silence of the overheard and wandered forth together among the graves.

There, among the graves, she eyed him. He was a clerk at eighteen shillings a week, and he
looked it. His mother was a sempstress, and he looked it. The idea of neat but shabby Denry
and the mighty Duncalf not hitting it off together seemed excessively comic. If only Denry
could have worn his dress-suit at church! It vexed him exceedingly that he had only worn that
expensive dress-suit once, and saw no faintest hope of ever being able to wear it again.

"And what's more," Denry pursued, "I'll collect 'em for five per cent, instead of seven-and-a-half.
Give me a free hand, and see if I don't get better results than he did. And I'll settle accounts
every month, or week if you like, instead of once a quarter, like he does."

The bright and beautiful idea had smitten Denry like some heavenly arrow. It went through him
and pierced Mrs Codleyn with equal success. It was an idea that appealed to the reason, to
the pocket, and to the instinct of revenge. Having revengefully settled the hash of Mr Duncalf,
they went into church.

No need to continue this part of the narrative. Even the text of the rector's sermon has no
bearing on the issue.

In a week there was a painted board affixed to the door of Denry's mother:

E.H. MACHIN, Rent Collector and Estate Agent.

There was also an advertisement in the Signal, announcing that Denry managed estates large
or small.

III

The next crucial event in Denry's career happened one Monday morning, in a cottage that was
very much smaller even than his mother's. This cottage, part of Mrs Codleyn's multitudinous
property, stood by itself in Chapel Alley, behind the Wesleyan chapel; the majority of the
tenements were in Carpenter's Square, near to. The neighbourhood was not distinguished for
its social splendour, but existence in it was picturesque, varied, exciting, full of accidents,
as existence is apt to be in residences that cost their occupiers an average of three shillings
a week. Some persons referred to the quarter as a slum, and ironically insisted on its adjacency
to the Wesleyan chapel, as though that was the Wesleyan chapel's fault. Such people did not
understand life and the joy thereof.

The solitary cottage had a front yard, about as large as a blanket, surrounded by an insecure
brick wall and paved with mud. You went up two steps, pushed at a door, and instantly found
yourself in the principal reception-room, which no earthly blanket could possibly have covered.
Behind this chamber could be seen obscurely an apartment so tiny that an auctioneer would have
been justified in terming it "bijou," Furnished simply but practically with a slopstone; also
the beginnings of a stairway. The furniture of the reception-room comprised two chairs and
a table, one or two saucepans, and some antique crockery. What lay at the upper end of the
stairway no living person knew, save the old woman who slept there. The old woman sat at the
fireplace, "all bunched up," as they say in the Five Towns. The only fire in the room, however,
was in the short clay pipe which she smoked; Mrs Hullins was one of the last old women in Bursley
to smoke a cutty; and even then the pipe was considered coarse, and cigarettes were coming
into fashion--though not in Chapel Alley. Mrs Hullins smoked her pipe, and thought about nothing
in particular. Occasionally some vision of the past floated through her drowsy brain. She had
lived in that residence for over forty years. She had brought up eleven children and two husbands
there. She had coddled thirty-five grand-children there, and given instruction to some half-dozen
daughters-in-law. She had known midnights when she could scarcely move in that residence without
disturbing somebody asleep. Now she was alone in it. She never left it, except to fetch water
from the pump in the square. She had seen a lot of life, and she was tired.

Denry came unceremoniously in, smiling gaily and benevolently, with his bright, optimistic
face under his fair brown hair. He had large and good teeth. He was getting--not stout, but plump.

"Well, mother!" he greeted Mrs Hullins, and sat down on the other chair.

A young fellow obviously at peace with the world, a young fellow content with himself for the
moment. No longer a clerk; one of the employed; saying "sir" to persons with no more fingers
and toes than he had himself; bound by servile agreement to be in a fixed place at fixed hours!
An independent unit, master of his own time and his own movements! In brief, a man! The truth
was that he earned now in two days a week slightly more than Mr Duncalf paid him for the labour
of five and a half days. His income, as collector of rents and manager of estates large or
small, totalled about a pound a week. But, he walked forth in the town, smiled, joked, spoke
vaguely, and said, "Do you?" to such a tune that his income might have been guessed to be anything
from ten pounds a week to ten thousand a year. And he had four days a week in which to excogitate
new methods of creating a fortune.

"I've nowt for ye," said the old woman, not moving.

"Come, come, now! That won't do," said Denry. "Have a pinch of my tobacco."

She accepted a pinch of his tobacco, and refilled her pipe, and he gave her a match.

"I'm not going out of this house without half-a-crown at any rate!" said Denry, blithely.

And he rolled himself a cigarette, possibly to keep warm. It was very chilly in the stuffy
residence, but the old woman never shivered. She was one of those old women who seem to wear
all the skirts of all their lives, one over the other.

"Ye're here for th' better part o' some time, then," observed Mrs Hullins, looking facts in
the face. "I've told you about my son Jack. He's been playing [out of work] six weeks. He starts
to-day, and he'll gi'me summat Saturday."

"That won't do," said Denry, curtly and kindly.

He then, with his bluff benevolence, explained to Mother Hullins that Mrs Codleyn would stand
no further increase of arrears from anybody, that she could not afford to stand any further
increase of arrears, that her tenants were ruining her, and that he himself, with all his cheery
good-will for the rent-paying classes, would be involved in her fall.

"Six-and-forty years have I been i' this 'ere house!" said Mrs Hullins.

"Yes, I know," said Denry. "And look at what you owe, mother!"

It was with immense good-humoured kindliness that he invited her attention to what she owed.
She tacitly declined to look at it.

"Your children ought to keep you," said Denry, upon her silence.

"Them as is dead, can't," said Mrs Hullins, "and them as is alive has their own to keep, except
Jack."

"Well, then, it's bailiffs," said Denry, but still cheerfully.

"Nay, nay! Ye'll none turn me out."

Denry threw up his hands, as if to exclaim: "I've done all I can, and I've given you a pinch
of tobacco. Besides, you oughtn't to be here alone. You ought to be with one of your children."

There was more conversation, which ended in Denry's repeating, with sympathetic resignation:

"No, you'll have to get out. It's bailiffs."

Immediately afterwards he left the residence with a bright filial smile. And then, in two minutes,
he popped his cheerful head in at the door again.

"Look here, mother," he said, "I'll lend you half-a-crown if you like."

Charity beamed on his face, and genuinely warmed his heart.

"But you must pay me something for the accommodation," he added. "I can't do it for nothing.
You must pay me back next week and give me threepence. That's fair. I couldn't bear to see
you turned out of your house. Now get your rent-book."

And he marked half-a-crown as paid in her greasy, dirty rent-book, and the same in his large book.

"Eh, you're a queer 'un, Mester Machin!" murmured the old woman as he left. He never knew precisely
what she meant. Fifteen--twenty--years later in his career her intonation of that phrase would
recur to him and puzzle him.

On the following Monday everybody in Chapel Alley and Carpenter's Square seemed to know that
the inconvenience of bailiffs and eviction could be avoided by arrangement with Denry the philanthropist.
He did quite a business. And having regard to the fantastic nature of the security, he could
not well charge less than threepence a week for half-a-crown. That was about 40 per cent. a
month and 500 per cent. per annum. The security was merely fantastic, but nevertheless he had
his remedy against evil-doers. He would take what they paid him for rent and refuse to mark
it as rent, appropriating it to his loans, so that the fear of bailiffs was upon them again.
Thus, as the good genius of Chapel Alley and Carpenter's Square, saving the distressed from
the rigours of the open street, rescuing the needy from their tightest corners, keeping many
a home together when but for him it would have fallen to pieces--always smiling, jolly, sympathetic,
and picturesque--Denry at length employed the five-pound note won from Harold Etches. A five-pound
note-- especially a new and crisp one, as this was--is a miraculous fragment of matter, wonderful
in the pleasure which the sight of it gives, even to millionaires; but perhaps no five-pound
note was ever so miraculous as Denry's. Ten per cent. per week, compound interest, mounts up;
it ascends, and it lifts. Denry never talked precisely. But the town soon began to comprehend
that he was a rising man, a man to watch. The town admitted that, so far, he had lived up to
his reputation as a dancer with countesses. The town felt that there was something indefinable
about Denry.

Denry himself felt this. He did not consider himself clever or brilliant. But he considered
himself peculiarly gifted. He considered himself different from other men. His thoughts would run:

"Anybody but me would have knuckled down to Duncalf and remained a shorthand clerk for ever."

"Who but me would have had the idea of going to the ball and asking the Countess to dance?...
And then that business with the fan!"

"Who but me would have had the idea of taking his rent-collecting off Duncalf?"

"Who but me would have had the idea of combining these loans with the rent-collecting? It's
simple enough! It's just what they want! And yet nobody ever thought of it till I thought of it!"

And he knew of a surety that he was that most admired type in the bustling, industrial provinces--a
card.

IV

The desire to become a member of the Sports Club revived in his breast. And yet, celebrity
though he was, rising though he was, he secretly regarded the Sports Club at Hillport as being
really a bit above him. The Sports Club was the latest and greatest phenomenon of social life
in Bursley, and it was emphatically the club to which it behoved the golden youth of the town
to belong. To Denry's generation the Conservative Club and the Liberal Club did not seem like
real clubs; they were machinery for politics, and membership carried nearly no distinction
with it. But the Sports Club had been founded by the most dashing young men of Hillport, which
is the most aristocratic suburb of Bursley and set on a lofty eminence. The sons of the wealthiest
earthenware manufacturers made a point of belonging to it, and, after a period of disdain,
their fathers also made a point of belonging to it. It was housed in an old mansion, with extensive
grounds and a pond and tennis courts; it had a working agreement with the Golf Club and with
the Hillport Cricket Club. But chiefly it was a social affair. The correctest thing was to
be seen there at nights, rather late than early; and an exact knowledge of card games and billiards
was worth more in it than prowess on the field.

It was a club in the Pall Mall sense of the word.

And Denry still lived in insignificant Brougham Street, and his mother was still a sempstress!
These were apparently insurmountable truths. All the men whom he knew to be members were somehow
more dashing than Denry --and it was a question of dash; few things are more mysterious than
dash. Denry was unique, knew himself to be unique; he had danced with a countess, and yet...
these other fellows!... Yes, there are puzzles, baffling puzzles, in the social career.

In going over on Tuesdays to Hanbridge, where he had a few trifling rents to collect, Denry
often encountered Harold Etches in the tramcar. At that time Etches lived at Hillport, and
the principal Etches manufactory was at Hanbridge. Etches partook of the riches of his family,
and, though a bachelor, was reputed to have the spending of at least a thousand a year. He
was famous, on summer Sundays, on the pier at Llandudno, in white flannels. He had been one
of the originators of the Sports Club. He spent far more on clothes alone than Denry spent
in the entire enterprise of keeping his soul in his body. At their first meeting little was
said. They were not equals, and nothing but dress-suits could make them equals. However, even
a king could not refuse speech with a scullion whom he had allowed to win money from him.

And Etches and Denry chatted feebly. Bit by bit they chatted less feebly. And once, when they
were almost alone on the car, they chatted with vehemence during the complete journey of twenty
minutes.

"He isn't so bad," said Denry to himself, of the dashing Harold Etches.

And he took a private oath that at his very next encounter with Etches he would mention the
Sports Club--"just to see." This oath disturbed his sleep for several night. But with Denry
an oath was sacred. Having sworn that he would mention the club to Etches, he was bound to
mention it. When Tuesday came, he hoped that Etches would not be on the tram, and the coward
in him would have walked to Hanbridge instead of taking the tram. But he was brave. And he
boarded the tram, and Etches was already in it. Now that he looked at it close, the enterprise
of suggesting to Harold Etches that he, Denry, would be a suitable member of the Sports Club
at Hillport, seemed in the highest degree preposterous. Why! He could not play any games at
all! He was a figure only in the streets! Nevertheless--the oath!

He sat awkwardly silent for a few moments, wondering how to begin. And then Harold Etches leaned
across the tram to him and said:

"I say, Machin, I've several times meant to ask you. Why don't you put up for the Sports Club?
It's really very good, you know."

Denry blushed, quite probably for the last time in his life. And he saw with fresh clearness
how great he was, and how large he must loom in the life of the town. He perceived that he
had been too modest.

V

You could not be elected to the Sports Club all in a minute. There were formalities; and that
these formalities were complicated and took time is simply a proof that the club was correctly
exclusive and worth belonging to. When at length Denry received notice from the "Secretary
and Steward" that he was elected to the most sparkling fellowship in the Five Towns, he was
positively afraid to go and visit the club. He wanted some old and experienced member to lead
him gently into the club and explain its usages and introduce him to the chief habitués. Or
else he wanted to slip in unobserved while the heads of clubmen were turned. And then he had
a distressing shock. Mrs Codleyn took it into her head that she must sell her cottage property.
Now, Mrs Codleyn's cottage property was the back-bone of Denry's livelihood, and he could by
no means be sure that a new owner would employ him as rent-collector. A new owner might have
the absurd notion of collecting rents in person. Vainly did Denry exhibit to Mrs Codleyn rows
of figures, showing that her income from the property had increased under his control. Vainly
did he assert that from no other form of investment would she derive such a handsome interest.
She went so far as to consult an auctioneer. The auctioneer's idea of what could constitute
a fair reserve price shook, but did not quite overthrow her. At this crisis it was that Denry
happened to say to her, in his new large manner: "Why! If I could afford, I'd buy the property
off you myself, just to show you...!" (He did not explain, and he did not perhaps know himself,
what had to be shown.) She answered that she wished to goodness he would! Then he said wildly
that he would, in instalments! And he actually did buy the Widow Hullins's half-a-crown-a-week
cottage for forty-five pounds, of which he paid thirty pounds in cash and arranged that the
balance should be deducted gradually from his weekly commission. He chose the Widow Hullins's
because it stood by itself--an odd piece, as it were, chipped off from the block of Mrs Codleyn's
realty. The transaction quietened Mrs Codleyn. And Denry felt secure because she could not
now dispense with his services without losing her security for fifteen pounds. (He still thought
in these small sums instead of thinking in thousands.)

He was now a property owner.

Encouraged by this great and solemn fact, he went up one afternoon to the club at Hillport.
His entry was magnificent, superficially. No one suspected that he was nervous under the ordeal.
The truth is that no one suspected because the place was empty. The emptiness of the hall gave
him pause. He saw a large framed copy of the "Rules" hanging under a deer's head, and he read
them as carefully as though he had not got a copy in his pocket. Then he read the notices,
as though they had been latest telegrams from some dire seat of war. Then, perceiving a massive
open door of oak (the club-house had once been a pretty stately mansion), he passed through
it, and saw a bar (with bottles) and a number of small tables and wicker chairs, and on one
of the tables an example of the Staffordshire Signal displaying in vast letters the fearful
question:--"Is your skin troublesome?" Denry's skin was troublesome; it crept. He crossed the
hall and went into another room which was placarded "Silence." And silence was. And on a table
with copies of The Potter's World, The British Australasian, The Iron Trades Review, and the
Golfers' Annual, was a second copy of the Signal, again demanding of Denry in vast letters
whether his skin was troublesome. Evidently the reading-room.

He ascended the stairs and discovered a deserted billiard-room with two tables. Though he had
never played at billiards, he seized a cue, but when he touched them the balls gave such a
resounding click in the hush of the chamber that he put the cue away instantly. He noticed
another door, curiously opened it, and started back at the sight of a small room, and eight
middle-aged men, mostly hatted, playing cards in two groups. They had the air of conspirators,
but they were merely some of the finest solo-whist players in Bursley. (This was before bridge
had quitted Pall Mall.) Among them was Mr Duncalf. Denry shut the door quickly. He felt like
a wanderer in an enchanted castle who had suddenly come across something that ought not to
be come across. He returned to earth, and in the hall met a man in shirt-sleeves--the Secretary
and Steward, a nice, homely man, who said, in the accents of ancient friendship, though he
had never spoken to Denry before: "Is it Mr Machin? Glad to see you, Mr Machin! Come and have
a drink with me, will you? Give it a name." Saying which, the Secretary and Steward went behind
the bar, and Denry imbibed a little whisky and much information.

"Anyhow, I've been!" he said to himself, going home.

VI

The next night he made another visit to the club, about ten o'clock. The reading-room, that
haunt of learning, was as empty as ever; but the bar was full of men, smoke, and glasses. It
was so full that Denry's arrival was scarcely observed. However, the Secretary and Steward
observed him, and soon he was chatting with a group at the bar, presided over by the Secretary
and Steward's shirt-sleeves. He glanced around, and was satisfied. It was a scene of dashing
gaiety and worldliness that did not belie the club's reputation. Some of the most important
men in Bursley were there. Charles Fearns, the solicitor, who practised at Hanbridge, was arguing
vivaciously in a corner. Fearns lived at Bleakridge and belonged to the Bleakridge Club, and
his presence at Hillport (two miles from Bleakridge) was a dramatic tribute to the prestige
of Hillport's Club.

Fearns was apparently in one of his anarchistic moods. Though a successful business man who
voted right, he was pleased occasionally to uproot the fabric of society and rebuild it on
a new plan of his own. To-night he was inveighing against landlords--he who by "conveyancing"
kept a wife and family, and a French governess for the family, in rather more than comfort.
The Fearns's French governess was one of the seven wonders of the Five Towns. Men enjoyed him
in these moods; and as he raised his voice, so he enlarged the circle of his audience.

"If the by-laws of this town were worth a bilberry," he was saying, "about a thousand so-called
houses would have to come down to-morrow. Now there's that old woman I was talking about just
now--Hullins. She's a Catholic--and my governess is always slumming about among Catholics--
that's how I know. She's paid half-a-crown a week for pretty near half a century for a hovel
that isn't worth eighteen-pence, and now she's going to be pitched into the street because
she can't pay any more. And she's seventy if she's a day! And that's the basis of society.
Nice refined society, eh?"

"Who's the grasping owner?" some one asked.

"Old Mrs Codleyn," said Fearns.

"Here, Mr Machin, they're talking about you," said the Secretary and Steward, genially. He
knew that Denry collected Mrs Codleyn's rents.

"Mrs Codleyn isn't the owner," Denry called out across the room, almost before he was aware
what he was doing. There was a smile on his face and a glass in his hand.

"Oh!" said Fearns. "I thought she was. Who is?"

Everybody looked inquisitively at the renowned Machin, the new member.

"I am," said Denry.

He had concealed the change of ownership from the Widow Hullins. In his quality of owner he
could not have lent her money in order that she might pay it instantly back to himself.

"I beg your pardon," said Fearns, with polite sincerity. "I'd no idea...!" He saw that unwittingly
he had come near to committing a gross outrage on club etiquette.

"Not at all!" said Denry. "But supposing the cottage was yours, what would you do, Mr Fearns?
Before I bought the property I used to lend her money myself to pay her rent."

"I know," Fearns answered, with a certain dryness of tone.

It occurred to Denry that the lawyer knew too much.

"Well, what should you do?" he repeated obstinately.

"She's an old woman," said Fearns. "And honest enough, you must admit. She came up to see my
governess, and I happened to see her."

"But what should you do in my place?" Denry insisted.

"Since you ask, I should lower the rent and let her off the arrears," said Fearns.

"And supposing she didn't pay then? Let her have it rent-free because she's seventy? Or pitch
her into the street?"

"Oh--Well--"

"Fearns would make her a present of the blooming house and give her a conveyance free!" a voice
said humorously, and everybody laughed.

"Well, that's what I'll do," said Denry. "If Mr Fearns will do the conveyance free, I'll make
her a present of the blooming house. That's the sort of grasping owner I am."

There was a startled pause. "I mean it," said Denry firmly, even fiercely, and raised his glass.
"Here's to the Widow Hullins!"

There was a sensation, because, incredible though the thing was, it had to be believed. Denry
himself was not the least astounded person in the crowded, smoky room. To him, it had been
like somebody else talking, not himself. But, as always when he did something crucial, spectacular,
and effective, the deed had seemed to be done by a mysterious power within him, over which
he had no control.

This particular deed was quixotic, enormously unusual; a deed assuredly without precedent in
the annals of the Five Towns. And he, Denry, had done it. The cost was prodigious, ridiculously
and dangerously beyond his means. He could find no rational excuse for the deed. But he had
done it. And men again wondered. Men had wondered when he led the Countess out to waltz. That
was nothing to this. What! A smooth-chinned youth giving houses away--out of mere, mad, impulsive
generosity.

And men said, on reflection, "Of course, that's just the sort of thing Machin would do!" They
appeared to find a logical connection between dancing with a Countess and tossing a house or
so to a poor widow. And the next morning every man who had been in the Sports Club that night
was remarking eagerly to his friends: "I say, have you heard young Machin's latest?"

And Denry, inwardly aghast at his own rashness, was saying to himself: "Well, no one but me
would ever have done that!"

He was now not simply a card; he was the card.

CHAPTER III

THE PANTECHNICON

I

"How do you do, Miss Earp?" said Denry, in a worldly manner, which he had acquired for himself
by taking the most effective features of the manners of several prominent citizens, and piecing
them together so that, as a whole, they formed Denry's manner.

"Oh! How do you do, Mr Machin?" said Ruth Earp, who had opened her door to him at the corner
of Tudor Passage and St Luke's Square.

It was an afternoon in July. Denry wore a new summer suit, whose pattern indicated not only
present prosperity but the firm belief that prosperity would continue. As for Ruth, that plain
but piquant girl was in one of her simpler costumes; blue linen; no jewellery. Her hair was
in its usual calculated disorder; its outer fleeces held the light. She was now at least twenty-five,
and her gaze disconcertingly combined extreme maturity with extreme candour. At one moment
a man would be saying to himself: "This woman knows more of the secrets of human nature than
I can ever know." And the next he would be saying to himself: "What a simple little thing she
is!" The career of nearly every man is marked at the sharp corners with such women. Speaking
generally, Ruth Earp's demeanour was hard and challenging. It was evident that she could not
be subject to the common weaknesses of her sex. Denry was glad.

A youth of quick intelligence, he had perceived all the dangers of the mission upon which he
was engaged, and had planned his precautions.

"May I come in a minute?" he asked in a purely business tone. There was no hint in that tone
of the fact that once she had accorded him a supper-dance.

"Please do," said Ruth.

An agreeable flouncing swish of linen skirts as she turned to precede him down the passage!
But he ignored it. That is to say, he easily steeled himself against it.

She led him to the large room which served as her dancing academy--the bare-boarded place in
which, a year and a half before, she had taught his clumsy limbs the principles of grace and
rhythm. She occupied the back part of a building of which the front part was an empty shop.
The shop had been tenanted by her father, one of whose frequent bankruptcies had happened there;
after which his stock of the latest novelties in inexpensive furniture had been seized by rapacious
creditors, and Mr Earp had migrated to Birmingham, where he was courting the Official Receiver
anew. Ruth had remained solitary and unprotected, with a considerable amount of household goods
which had been her mother's. (Like all professional bankrupts, Mr Earp had invariably had belongings
which, as he could prove to his creditors, did not belong to him.) Public opinion had justified
Ruth in her enterprise of staying in Bursley on her own responsibility and renting part of
the building, in order not to lose her "connection" as a dancing-mistress. Public opinion said
that "there would have been no sense in her going dangling after her wastrel of a father."

"Quite a long time since we saw anything of each other," observed Ruth in rather a pleasant
style, as she sat down and as he sat down.

It was. The intimate ecstasy of the supper-dance had never been repeated. Denry's exceeding
industry in carving out his career, and his desire to graduate as an accomplished clubman,
had prevented him from giving to his heart that attention which it deserved, having regard
to his tender years.

"Yes, it is, isn't it?" said Denry.

Then there was a pause, and they both glanced vaguely about the inhospitable and very wooden
room. Now was the moment for Denry to carry out his pre-arranged plan in all its savage simplicity.
He did so. "I've called about the rent, Miss Earp," he said, and by an effort looked her in
the eyes.

"The rent?" exclaimed Ruth, as though she had never in all her life heard of such a thing as
rent; as though June 24 (recently past) was an ordinary day like any other day.

"Yes," said Denry.

"What rent?" asked Ruth, as though for aught she guessed it might have been the rent of Buckingham
Palace that he had called about.

"Yours," said Denry.

"Mine!" she murmured. "But what has my rent got to do with you?" she demanded. And it was just
as if she had said, "But what has my rent got to do with you, little boy?"

"Well," he said, "I suppose you know I'm a rent-collector?"

"No, I didn't," she said.

He thought she was fibbing out of sheer naughtiness. But she was not. She did not know that
he collected rents. She knew that he was a card, a figure, a celebrity; and that was all. It
is strange how the knowledge of even the cleverest woman will confine itself to certain fields.

"Yes," he said, always in a cold, commercial tone, "I collect rents."

"I should have thought you'd have preferred postage-stamps," she said, gazing out of the window
at a kiln that was blackening all the sky.

If he could have invented something clever and cutting in response to this sally he might have
made the mistake of quitting his rôle of hard, unsentimental man of business. But he could
think of nothing. So he proceeded sternly:

"Mr Herbert Calvert has put all his property into my hands, and he has given me strict instructions
that no rent is to be allowed to remain in arrear."

No answer from Ruth. Mr Calvert was a little fellow of fifty who had made money in the mysterious
calling of a "commission agent." By reputation he was really very much harder than Denry could
even pretend to be, and indeed Denry had been considerably startled by the advent of such a
client. Surely if any man in Bursley were capable of unmercifully collecting rents on his own
account, Herbert Calvert must be that man!

"Let me see," said Denry further, pulling a book from his pocket and peering into it, "you
owe five quarters' rent--thirty pounds."

He knew without the book precisely what Ruth owed, but the book kept him in countenance, supplied
him with needed moral support.

Ruth Earp, without the least warning, exploded into a long peal of gay laughter. Her laugh
was far prettier than her face. She laughed well. She might, with advantage to Bursley, have
given lessons in laughing as well as in dancing, for Bursley laughs without grace. Her laughter
was a proof that she had not a care in the world, and that the world for her was naught but
a source of light amusement.

Denry smiled guardedly.

"Of course, with me it's purely a matter of business," said he.

"So that's what Mr Herbert Calvert has done!" she exclaimed, amid the embers of her mirth.
"I wondered what he would do! I presume you know all about Mr Herbert Calvert," she added.

"No," said Denry, "I don't know anything about him, except that he owns some property and I'm
in charge of it. Stay," he corrected himself, "I think I do remember crossing his name off
your programme once."

And he said to himself: "That's one for her. If she likes to be so desperately funny about
postage-stamps, I don't see why I shouldn't have my turn." The recollection that it was precisely
Herbert Calvert whom he had supplanted in the supper-dance at the Countess of Chell's historic
ball somehow increased his confidence in his ability to manage the interview with brilliance.

Ruth's voice grew severe and chilly. It seemed incredible that she had just been laughing.

"I will tell you about Mr Herbert Calvert;" she enunciated her words with slow, stern clearness.
"Mr Herbert Calvert took advantage of his visits here for his rent to pay his attentions to
me. At one time he was so far--well--gone, that he would scarcely take his rent."

"Really!" murmured Denry, genuinely staggered by this symptom of the distance to which Mr Herbert
Calvert was once "gone."

"Yes," said Ruth, still sternly and inimically. "Naturally a woman can't make up her mind about
these things all of a sudden," she continued. "Naturally!" she repeated.

"Of course," Denry agreed, perceiving that his experience of life, and deep knowledge of human
nature were being appealed to.

"And when I did decide definitely, Mr Herbert Calvert did not behave like a gentleman. He forgot
what was due to himself and to me. I won't describe to you the scene he made. I'm simply telling
you this, so that you may know. To cut a long story short, he behaved in a very vulgar way.
And a woman doesn't forget these things, Mr Machin." Her eyes threatened him. "I decided to
punish Mr Herbert Calvert. I thought if he wouldn't take his rent before--well, let him wait
for it now! I might have given him notice to leave. But I didn't. I didn't see why I should
let myself be upset because Mr Herbert Calvert had forgotten that he was a gentleman. I said,
'Let him wait for his rent,' and I promised myself I would just see what he would dare to do."

"I don't quite follow your argument," Denry put in.

"Perhaps you don't," she silenced him. "I didn't expect you would. You and Mr Herbert Calvert...!
So he didn't dare to do anything himself, and he's paying you to do his dirty work for him!
Very well! Very well!..." She lifted her head defiantly. "What will happen if I don't pay the
rent?"

"I shall have to let things take their course," said Denry with a genial smile.

"All right, then," Ruth Earp responded. "If you choose to mix yourself up with people like
Mr Herbert Calvert, you must take the consequences! It's all the same to me, after all."

"Then it isn't convenient for you to pay anything on account?" said Denry, more and more affable.

"Convenient!" she cried. "It's perfectly convenient, only I don't care to. I won't pay a penny
until I'm forced. Let Mr Herbert Calvert do his worst, and then I'll pay. And not before! And
the whole town shall hear all about Mr Herbert Calvert!"

"I see," he laughed easily.

"Convenient!" she reiterated, contemptuously. "I think everybody in Bursley knows how my clientèle
gets larger and larger every year!... Convenient!"

"So that's final, Miss Earp?"

"Perfectly!" said Miss Earp.

He rose. "Then the simplest thing will be for me to send round a bailiff to-morrow morning,
early." He might have been saying: "The simplest thing will be for me to send round a bunch
of orchids."

Another man would have felt emotion, and probably expressed it. But not Denry, the rent-collector
and manager of estates large and small. There were several different men in Denry, but he had
the great gift of not mixing up two different Denrys when he found himself in a complicated
situation.

Ruth Earp rose also. She dropped her eyelids and looked at him from under them. And then she
gradually smiled.

"I thought I'd just see what you'd do," she said, in a low, confidential voice from which all
trace of hostility had suddenly departed. "You're a strange creature," she went on curiously,
as though fascinated by the problems presented by his individuality. "Of course, I shan't let
it go as far as that. I only thought I'd see what you'd say. I'll write you to-night."

"With a cheque?" Denry demanded, with suave, jolly courtesy. "I don't collect postage-stamps."

(And to himself: "She's got her stamps back.")

She hesitated. "Stay!" she said. "I'll tell you what will be better. Can you call to-morrow
afternoon? The bank will be closed now."

"Yes," he said, "I can call. What time?"

"Oh!" she answered, "any time. If you come in about four, I'll give you a cup of tea into the
bargain. Though you don't deserve it!" After an instant, she added reassuringly: "Of course
I know business is business with you. But I'm glad I've told you the real truth about your
precious Mr Herbert Calvert, all the same."

And as he walked slowly home Denry pondered upon the singular, erratic, incalculable strangeness
of woman, and of the possibly magic effect of his own personality on women.

II

It was the next afternoon, in July. Denry wore his new summer suit, but with a necktie of higher
rank than the previous day's. As for Ruth, that plain but piquant girl was in one of her more
elaborate and foamier costumes. The wonder was that such a costume could survive even for an
hour the smuts that lend continual interest and excitement to the atmosphere of Bursley. It
was a white muslin, spotted with spots of opaque white, and founded on something pink. Denry
imagined that he had seen parts of it before--at the ball; and he had; but it was now a tea-gown,
with long, languishing sleeves; the waves of it broke at her shoulders, sending lacy surf high
up the precipices of Ruth's neck. Denry did not know it was a tea-gown. But he knew that it
had a most peculiar and agreeable effect on himself, and that she had promised him tea. He
was glad that he had paid her the homage of his best necktie.

Although the month was July, Ruth wore a kind of shawl over the tea-gown. It was not a shawl,
Denry noted; it was merely about two yards of very thin muslin. He puzzled himself as to its
purpose. It could not be for warmth, for it would not have helped to melt an icicle. Could
it be meant to fulfil the same function as muslin in a confectioner's shop? She was pale. Her
voice was weak and had an imploring quality.

She led him, not into the inhospitable wooden academy, but into a very small room which, like
herself, was dressed in muslin and bows of ribbon. Photographs of amiable men and women decorated
the pinkish-green walls. The mantelpiece was concealed in drapery as though it had been a sin.
A writing-desk as green as a leaf stood carelessly in one corner; on the desk a vase containing
some Cape gooseberries. In the middle of the room a small table, on the table a spirit-lamp
in full blast, and on the lamp a kettle practising scales; a tray occupied the remainder of
the table. There were two easy chairs; Ruth sank delicately into one, and Denry took the other
with precautions.

He was nervous. Nothing equals muslin for imparting nervousness to the naïve. But he felt pleased.

"Not much of the Widow Hullins touch about this!" he reflected privately.

And he wished that all rent-collecting might be done with such ease, and amid such surroundings,
as this particular piece of rent-collecting. He saw what a fine thing it was to be a free man,
under orders from nobody; not many men in Bursley were in a position to accept invitations
to four o'clock tea at a day's notice. Further 5 per cent. on thirty pounds was thirty shillings,
so that if he stayed an hour--and he meant to stay an hour--he would, while enjoying himself,
be earning money steadily at the rate of sixpence a minute.

It was the ideal of a business career.

When the kettle, having finished its scales, burst into song with an accompaniment of castanets
and vapour, and Ruth's sleeves rose and fell as she made the tea, Denry acknowledged frankly
to himself that it was this sort of thing, and not the Brougham Street sort of thing, that
he was really born for. He acknowledged to himself humbly that this sort of thing was "life,"
and that hitherto he had had no adequate idea of what "life" was. For, with all his ability
as a card and a rising man, with all his assiduous frequenting of the Sports Club, he had not
penetrated into the upper domestic strata of Bursley society. He had never been invited to
any house where, as he put it, he would have had to mind his p's and q's. He still remained
the kind of man whom you familiarly chat with in the street and club, and no more. His mother's
fame as a flannel-washer was against him; Brougham Street was against him; and, chiefly, his
poverty was against him. True, he had gorgeously given a house away to an aged widow! True,
he succeeded in transmitting to his acquaintances a vague idea that he was doing well and waxing
financially from strength to strength! But the idea was too vague, too much in the air. And
save by a suit of clothes, he never gave ocular proof that he had money to waste. He could
not. It was impossible for him to compete with even the more modest of the bloods and the blades.
To keep a satisfactory straight crease down the middle of each leg of his trousers was all
he could accomplish with the money regularly at his disposal. The town was wafting for him
to do something decisive in the matter of what it called "the stuff."

Thus Ruth Earp was the first to introduce him to the higher intimate civilisations, the refinements
lurking behind the foul walls of Bursley.

"Sugar?" she questioned, her head on one side, her arm uplifted, her sleeve drooping, and a
bit of sugar caught like a white mouse between the claws of the tongs.

Nobody before had ever said "Sugar?" to him like that. His mother never said "Sugar?" to him.
His mother was aware that he liked three pieces, but she would not give him more than two.
"Sugar?" in that slightly weak, imploring voice seemed to be charged with a significance at
once tremendous and elusive.

"Yes, please."

"Another?"

And the "Another?" was even more delicious.

He said to himself: "I suppose this is what they call flirting."

When a chronicler tells the exact truth, there is always a danger that he will not be believed.
Yet, in spite of the risk, it must be said plainly that at this point Denry actually thought
of marriage. An absurd and childish thought, preposterously rash; but it came into his mind,
and--what is more--it stuck there! He pictured marriage as a perpetual afternoon tea alone
with an elegant woman, amid an environment of ribboned muslin. And the picture appealed to
him very strongly. And Ruth appeared to him in a new light. It was perhaps the change in her
voice that did it. She appeared to him at once as a creature very feminine and enchanting,
and as a creature who could earn her own living in a manner that was both original and ladylike.
A woman such as Ruth would be a delight without being a drag. And, truly, was she not a remarkable
woman, as remarkable as he was a man? Here she was living amid the refinements of luxury. Not
an expensive luxury (he had an excellent notion of the monetary value of things), but still
luxury. And the whole affair was so stylish. His heart went out to the stylish.

The slices of bread-and-butter were rolled up. There, now, was a pleasing device! It cost nothing
to roll up a slice of bread-and-butter --her fingers had doubtless done the rolling--and yet
it gave quite a different taste to the food.

"What made you give that house to Mrs Hullins?" she asked him suddenly, with a candour that
seemed to demand candour.

"Oh," he said, "just a lark! I thought I would. It came to me all in a second, and I did."

She shook her head. "Strange boy!" she observed.

There was a pause.

"It was something Charlie Fearns said, wasn't it?" she inquired.

She uttered the name "Charlie Fearns" with a certain faint hint of disdain, as if indicating
to Denry that of course she and Denry were quite able to put Fearns into his proper place in
the scheme of things.

"Oh!" he said. "So you know all about it?"

"Well," said she, "naturally it was all over the town. Mrs Fearns's girl, Annunciata--what
a name, eh?--is one of my pupils--the youngest, in fact."

"Well," said he, after another pause, "I wasn't going to have Fearns coming the duke over me!"
She smiled sympathetically. He felt that they understood each other deeply.

"You'll find some cigarettes in that box," she said, when he had been there thirty minutes,
and pointed to the mantelpiece.

"Sure you don't mind?" he murmured.

She raised her eyebrows.

There was also a silver match-box in the larger box. No detail lacked. It seemed to him that
he stood on a mountain and had only to walk down a winding path in order to enter the promised
land. He was decidedly pleased with the worldly way in which he had said: "Sure you don't mind?"

He puffed out smoke delicately. And, the cigarette between his lips, as with his left hand
he waved the match into extinction, he demanded:

"You smoke?"

"Yes," she said, "but not in public. I know what you men are."

This was in the early, timid days of feminine smoking.

"I assure you!" he protested, and pushed the box towards her. But she would not smoke.

"It isn't that I mind you," she said, "not at all. But I'm not well. I've got a frightful headache."

He put on a concerned expression.

"I thought you looked rather pale," he said awkwardly.

"Pale!" she repeated the word. "You should have seen me this morning: I have fits of dizziness,
you know, too. The doctor says it's nothing but dyspepsia. However, don't let's talk about
poor little me and my silly complaints. Perhaps the tea will do me good."

He protested again, but his experience of intimate civilisation was too brief to allow him
to protest with effectiveness. The truth was, he could not say these things naturally. He had
to compose them, and then pronounce them, and the result failed in the necessary air of spontaneity.
He could not help thinking what marvellous self-control women had. Now, when he had a headache--which
happily was seldom--he could think of nothing else and talk of nothing else; the entire universe
consisted solely of his headache. And here she was overcome with a headache, and during more
than half-an-hour had not even mentioned it!

She began talking gossip about the Fearnses and the Swetnams, and she mentioned rumours concerning
Henry Mynors (who had scruples against dancing) and Anna Tellwright, the daughter of that rich
old skinflint Ephraim Tellwright. No mistake; she was on the inside of things in Bursley society!
It was just as if she had removed the front walls of every house and examined every room at
her leisure, with minute particularity. But of course a teacher of dancing had opportunities....
Denry had to pretend to be nearly as omniscient as she was.

Then she broke off, without warning, and lay back in her chair.

"I wonder if you'd mind going into the barn for me?" she murmured.

She generally referred to her academy as the barn. It had once been a warehouse.

He jumped up. "Certainly," he said, very eager.

"I think you'll see a small bottle of eau-de-Cologne on the top of the piano," she said, and
shut her eyes.

He hastened away, full of his mission, and feeling himself to be a terrific cavalier and guardian
of weak women. He felt keenly that he must be equal to the situation. Yes, the small bottle
of eau-de-Cologne was on the top of the piano. He seized it and bore it to her on the wings
of chivalry. He had not been aware that eau-de-Cologne was a remedy for, or a palliative of,
headaches.

She opened her eyes, and with a great effort tried to be bright and better. But it was a failure.
She took the stopper out of the bottle and sniffed first at the stopper and then at the bottle;
then she spilled a few drops of the liquid on her handkerchief and applied the handkerchief
to her temples.

"It's easier," she said.

"Sure?" he asked. He did not know what to do with himself--whether to sit down and feign that
she was well, or to remain standing in an attitude of respectful and grave anxiety. He thought
he ought to depart; yet would it not be ungallant to desert her under the circumstances? She
was alone. She had no servant, only an occasional charwoman.

She nodded with brave, false gaiety. And then she had a relapse.

"Don't you think you'd better lie down?" he suggested in more masterful accents. And added;
"And I'll go....? You ought to lie down. It's the only thing." He was now speaking to her like
a wise uncle.

"Oh no!" she said, without conviction. "Besides, you can't go till I've paid you."

It was on the tip of his tongue to say, "Oh! don't bother about that now!" But he restrained
himself. There was a notable core of common-sense in Denry. He had been puzzling how he might
neatly mention the rent while departing in a hurry so that she might lie down. And now she
had solved the difficulty for him.

She stretched out her arm, and picked up a bunch of keys from a basket on a little table.

"You might just unlock that desk for me, will you?" she said. And, further, as she went through
the keys one by one to select the right key: "Each quarter I've put your precious Mr Herbert
Calvert's rent in a drawer in that desk. ... Here's the key." She held up the whole ring by
the chosen key, and he accepted it. And she lay back once more in her chair, exhausted by her
exertions.

"You must turn the key sharply in the lock," she said weakly, as he fumbled at the locked part
of the desk.

So he turned the key sharply.

"You'll see a bag in the little drawer on the right," she murmured.

The key turned round and round. It had begun by resisting, but now it yielded too easily.

"It doesn't seem to open," he said, feeling clumsy.

The key clicked and slid, and the other keys rattled together.

"Oh yes," she replied. "I opened it quite easily this morning. It is a bit catchy."

The key kept going round and round.

"Here! I'll do it," she said wearily.

"Oh no!" he urged.

But she rose courageously, and tottered to the desk, and took the bunch from him.

"I'm afraid you've broken something in the lock," she announced, with gentle resignation, after
she had tried to open the desk and failed.

"Have I?" he mumbled. He knew that he was not shining.

"Would you mind calling in at Allman's," she said, resuming her chair, "and tell them to send
a man down at once to pick the lock? There's nothing else for it. Or perhaps you'd better say
first thing to-morrow morning. And then as soon as he's done it I'll call and pay you the money
myself. And you might tell your precious Mr Herbert Calvert that next quarter I shall give
notice to leave."

"Don't you trouble to call, please," said he. "I can easily pop in here."

She sped him away in an enigmatic tone. He could not be sure whether he had succeeded or failed,
in her estimation, as a man of the world and a partaker of delicate teas.

"Don't forget Allman's!" she enjoined him as he left the room. He was to let himself out.

III

He was coming home late that night from the Sports Club, from a delectable evening which had
lasted till one o'clock in the morning, when just as he put the large door-key into his mother's
cottage he grew aware of peculiar phenomena at the top end of Brougham Street, where it runs
into St Luke's Square. And then in the gas-lit gloom of the warm summer night he perceived
a vast and vague rectangular form in the slow movement towards the slope of Brougham Street.

It was a pantechnicon van.

But the extraordinary thing was, not that it should be a pantechnicon van, but that if should
be moving of its own accord and power. For there were no horses in front of it, and Denry saw
that the double shafts had been pushed up perpendicularly, after the manner of carmen when
they outspan. The pantechnicon was running away. It had perceived the wrath to come and was
fleeing. Its guardians had evidently left it imperfectly scotched or braked, and it had got loose.

It proceeded down the first bit of Brougham Street with a dignity worthy of its dimensions,
and at the same time with apparently a certain sense of the humour of the situation. Then it
seemed to be saying to itself: "Pantechnicons will be pantechnicons." Then it took on the absurd
gravity of a man who is perfectly sure that he is not drunk. Nevertheless it kept fairly well
to the middle of the road, but as though the road were a tight-rope.

The rumble of it increased as it approached Denry. He withdrew the key from his mother's cottage
and put it in his pocket. He was always at his finest in a crisis. And the onrush of the pantechnicon
constituted a clear crisis. Lower down the gradient of Brougham Street was more dangerous,
and it was within the possibilities that people inhabiting the depths of the street might find
themselves pitched out of bed by the sharp corner of a pantechnicon that was determined to
be a pantechnicon. A pantechnicon whose ardour is fairly aroused may be capable of surpassing
deeds. Whole thoroughfares might crumble before it.

As the pantechnicon passed Denry, at the rate of about three and a half miles an hour, he leaped,
or rather he scrambled, on to it, losing nothing in the process except his straw hat, which
remained a witness at his mother's door that her boy had been that way and departed under unusual
circumstances. Denry had the bright idea of dropping the shafts down to act as a brake. But,
unaccustomed to the manipulation of shafts, he was rather slow in accomplishing the deed, and
ere the first pair of shafts had fallen the pantechnicon was doing quite eight miles an hour
and the steepest declivity was yet to come. Further, the dropping of the left-hand shafts jerked
the van to the left, and Denry dropped the other pair only just in time to avoid the sudden
uprooting of a lamp-post. The four points of the shafts digging and prodding into the surface
of the road gave the pantechnicon something to think about for a few seconds. But unfortunately
the precipitousness of the street encouraged its head-strong caprices, and a few seconds later
all four shafts were broken, and the pantechnicon seemed to scent the open prairie. (What it
really did scent was the canal.) Then Denry discovered the brake, and furiously struggled with
the iron handle. He turned it and turned it, some forty revolutions. It seemed to have no effect.
The miracle was that the pantechnicon maintained its course in the middle of the street. Presently
Denry could vaguely distinguish the wall and double wooden gates of the canal wharf. He could
not jump off; the pantechnicon was now an express, and I doubt whether he would have jumped
off, even if jumping off had not been madness. His was the kind of perseverance that, for the
fun of it, will perish in an attempt. The final fifty or sixty yards of Brougham Street were
level, and the pantechnicon slightly abated its haste. Denry could now plainly see, in the
radiance of a gas-lamp, the gates of the wharf, and on them the painted letters:--

  SHROPSHIRE UNION CANAL COY., LTD..

  GENERAL CARRIERS.

  No Admittance except on Business

He was heading straight for those gates, and the pantechnicon evidently had business within.
It jolted over the iron guard of the weighing-machine, and this jolt deflected it, so that
instead of aiming at the gates it aimed for part of a gate and part of a brick pillar. Denry
ground his teeth together and clung to his seat. The gate might have been paper, and the brick
pillar a cardboard pillar. The pantechnicon went through them as a sword will go through a
ghost, and Denry was still alive. The remainder of the journey was brief and violent, owing
partly to a number of bags of cement, and partly to the propinquity of the canal basin. The
pantechnicon jumped into the canal like a mastodon, and drank.

Denry, clinging to the woodwork, was submerged for a moment, but, by standing on the narrow
platform from which sprouted the splintered ends of the shafts, he could get his waist clear
of the water. He was not a swimmer.

All was still and dark, save for the faint stream of starlight on the broad bosom of the canal
basin. The pantechnicon had encountered nobody whatever en route. Of its strange escapade Denry
had been the sole witness.

"Well, I'm dashed!" he murmured aloud.

And a voice replied from the belly of the pantechnicon:

"Who is there?"

All Denry's body shook.

"It's me!" said he.

"Not Mr Machin?" said the voice.

"Yes," said he. "I jumped on as it came down the street--and here we are!"

"Oh!" cried the voice. "I do wish you could get round to me."

Ruth Earp's voice.

He saw the truth in a moment of piercing insight. Ruth had been playing with him! She had performed
a comedy for him in two acts. She had meant to do what is called in the Five Towns "a moonlight
flit." The pantechnicon (doubtless from Birmingham, where her father was) had been brought
to her door late in the evening, and was to have been filled and taken away during the night.
The horses had been stabled, probably in Ruth's own yard, and while the carmen were reposing
the pantechnicon had got off, Ruth in it. She had no money locked in her unlockable desk. Her
reason for not having paid the precious Mr Herbert Calvert was not the reason which she had
advanced.

His first staggered thought was:

"She's got a nerve! No mistake!"

Her duplicity, her wickedness, did not shock him. He admired her tremendous and audacious enterprise;
it appealed strongly to every cell in his brain. He felt that she and he were kindred spirits.

He tried to clamber round the side of the van so as to get to the doors at the back, but a
pantechnicon has a wheel-base which forbids leaping from wheel to wheel, especially, when the
wheels are under water. Hence he was obliged to climb on to the roof, and so slide down on
to the top of one of the doors, which was swinging loose. The feat was not simple. At last
he felt the floor of the van under half a yard of water.

"Where are you?"

"I'm here," said Ruth, very plaintively. "I'm on a table. It was the only thing they had put
into the van before they went off to have their supper or something. Furniture removers are
always like that. Haven't you got a match?"

"I've got scores of matches," said Denry. "But what good do you suppose they'll be now, all
soaked through?"

A short silence. He noticed that she had offered no explanation of her conduct towards himself.
She seemed to take it for granted that he would understand.

"I'm frightfully bumped, and I believe my nose is bleeding," said Ruth, still more plaintively.
"It's a good thing there was a lot of straw and sacks here."

Then, after much groping, his hand touched her wet dress.

"You know you're a very naughty girl," he said.

He heard a sob, a wild sob. The proud, independent creature had broken down under the stress
of events. He climbed out of the water on to the part of the table which she was not occupying.
And the van was as black as Erebus.

Gradually, out of the welter of sobs, came faint articulations, and little by little he learnt
the entire story of her difficulties, her misfortunes, her struggles, and her defeats. He listened
to a frank confession of guilt. But what could she do? She had meant well. But what could she
do? She had been driven into a corner. And she had her father to think of! Honestly, on the
previous day, she had intended to pay the rent, or part of it. But there had been a disappointment!
And she had been so unwell. In short...

The van gave a lurch. She clutched at him and he at her. The van was settling down for a comfortable
night in the mud.

(Queer that it had not occurred to him before, but at the first visit she had postponed paying
him on the plea that the bank was closed, while at the second visit she had stated that the
actual cash had been slowly accumulating in her desk! And the discrepancy had not struck him.
Such is the influence of a teagown. However, he forgave her, in consideration of her immense
audacity.)

"What can we do?" she almost whispered.

Her confidence in him affected him.

"Wait till it gets light," said he.

So they waited, amid the waste of waters. In a hot July it is not unpleasant to dangle one's
feet in water during the sultry dark hours. She told him more and more.

When the inspiring grey preliminaries of the dawn began, Denry saw that at the back of the
pantechnicon the waste of waters extended for at most a yard, and that it was easy, by climbing
on to the roof, to jump therefrom to the wharf. He did so, and then fixed a plank so that Ruth
could get ashore. Relieved of their weight the table floated out after them. Denry seized it,
and set about smashing it to pieces with his feet.

"What are you doing?" she asked faintly. She was too enfeebled to protest more vigorously.

"Leave it to me," said Denry. "This table is the only thing that can give your show away. We
can't carry it back. We might meet some one."

He tied the fragments of the table together with rope that was afloat in the van, and attached
the heavy iron bar whose function was to keep the doors closed. Then he sank the faggot of
wood and iron in a distant corner of the basin.

"There!" he said. "Now you understand. Nothing's happened except that a furniture van's run
off and fallen into the canal owing to the men's carelessness. We can settle the rest later--I
mean about the rent and so on."

They looked at each other.

Her skirts were nearly dry. Her nose showed no trace of bleeding, but there was a bluish lump
over her left eye. Save that he was hatless, and that his trousers clung, he was not utterly
unpresentable.

They were alone in the silent dawn.

"You'd better go home by Acre Lane, not up Brougham Street," he said. "I'll come in during
the morning."

It was a parting in which more was felt than said.

They went one after the other through the devastated gateway, baptising the path as they walked.
The Town Hall clock struck three as Denry crept up his mother's stairs. He had seen not a soul.

IV

The exact truth in its details was never known to more than two inhabitants of Bursley. The
one thing clear certainly appeared to be that Denry, in endeavouring to prevent a runaway pantechnicon
from destroying the town, had travelled with it into the canal. The romantic trip was accepted
as perfectly characteristic of Denry. Around this island of fact washed a fabulous sea of uninformed
gossip, in which assertion conflicted with assertion, and the names of Denry and Ruth were
continually bumping against each other.

Mr Herbert Calvert glanced queerly and perhaps sardonically at Denry when Denry called and
handed over ten pounds (less commission) which he said Miss Earp had paid on account.

"Look here," said the little Calvert, his mean little eyes gleaming. "You must get in the balance
at once."

"That's all right," said Denry. "I shall."

"Was she trying to hook it on the q.t.?" Calvert demanded.

"Oh, no!" said Denry. "That was a very funny misunderstanding. The only explanation I can think
of is that that van must have come to the wrong house."

"Are you engaged to her?" Calvert asked, with amazing effrontery.

Denry paused. "Yes," he said. "Are you?"

Mr Calvert wondered what he meant.

He admitted to himself that the courtship had begun in a manner surpassingly strange.

CHAPTER IV

WRECKING OF A LIFE

I

In the Five Towns, and perhaps elsewhere, there exists a custom in virtue of which a couple
who have become engaged in the early summer find themselves by a most curious coincidence at
the same seaside resort, and often in the same street thereof, during August. Thus it happened
to Denry and to Ruth Earp. There had been difficulties--there always are. A business man who
lives by collecting weekly rents obviously cannot go away for an indefinite period. And a young
woman who lives alone in the world is bound to respect public opinion. However, Ruth arranged
that her girlish friend, Nellie Cotterill, who had generous parents, should accompany her.
And the North Staffordshire Railway's philanthropic scheme of issuing four-shilling tourist
return tickets to the seaside enabled Denry to persuade himself that he was not absolutely
mad in contemplating a fortnight on the shores of England.

Ruth chose Llandudno, Llandudno being more stylish than either Rhyl or Blackpool, and not dearer.
Ruth and Nellie had a double room in a boarding-house, No. 26 St Asaph's Road (off the Marine
Parade), and Denry had a small single room in another boarding-house, No. 28 St Asaph's Road.
The ideal could scarcely have been approached more nearly.

Denry had never seen the sea before. As, in his gayest clothes, he strolled along the esplanade
or on the pier between those two girls in their gayest clothes, and mingled with the immense
crowd of pleasure-seekers and money-spenders, he was undoubtedly much impressed by the beauty
and grandeur of the sea. But what impressed him far more than the beauty and grandeur of the
sea was the field for profitable commercial enterprise which a place like Llandudno presented.
He had not only his first vision of the sea, but his first genuine vision of the possibilities
of amassing wealth by honest ingenuity. On the morning after his arrival he went out for a
walk and lost himself near the Great Orme, and had to return hurriedly along the whole length
of the Parade about nine o'clock. And through every ground-floor window of every house he saw
a long table full of people eating and drinking the same kinds of food. In Llandudno fifty
thousand souls desired always to perform the same act at the same time; they wanted to be distracted
and they would do anything for the sake of distraction, and would pay for the privilege. And
they would all pay at once.

This great thought was more majestic to him than the sea, or the Great Orme, or the Little Orme.

It stuck in his head because he had suddenly grown into a very serious person. He had now something
to live for, something on which to lavish his energy. He was happy in being affianced, and
more proud than happy, and more startled than proud. The manner and method of his courtship
had sharply differed from his previous conception of what such an affair would be. He had not
passed through the sensations which he would have expected to pass through. And then this question
was continually presenting itself: What could she see in him? She must have got a notion that
he was far more wonderful than he really was. Could it be true that she, his superior in experience
and in splendour of person, had kissed him? Him! He felt that it would be his duty to live
up to this exaggerated notion which she had of him. But how?

II

They had not yet discussed finance at all, though Denry would have liked to discuss it. Evidently
she regarded him as a man of means. This became clear during the progress of the journey to
Llandudno. Denry was flattered, but the next day he had slight misgivings, and on the following
day he was alarmed; and on the day after that his state resembled terror. It is truer to say
that she regarded him less as a man of means than as a magic and inexhaustible siphon of money.

He simply could not stir out of the house without spending money, and often in ways quite unforeseen.
Pier, minstrels, Punch and Judy, bathing, buns, ices, canes, fruit, chairs, row-boats, concerts,
toffee, photographs, char-à-bancs: any of these expenditures was likely to happen whenever
they went forth for a simple stroll. One might think that strolls were gratis, that the air
was free! Error! If he had had the courage he would have left his purse in the house as Ruth
invariably did. But men are moral cowards.

He had calculated thus:--Return fare, four shillings a week. Agreed terms at boarding-house,
twenty-five shillings a week. Total expenses per week, twenty-nine shillings,--say thirty!

On the first day he spent fourteen shillings on nothing whatever--which was at the rate of
five pounds a week of supplementary estimates! On the second day he spent nineteen shillings
on nothing whatever, and Ruth insisted on his having tea with herself and Nellie at their boarding-house;
for which of course he had to pay, while his own tea was wasting next door. So the figures
ran on, jumping up each day. Mercifully, when Sunday dawned the open wound in his pocket was
temporarily stanched. Ruth wished him to come in for tea again. He refused--at any rate he
did not come--and the exquisite placidity of the stream of their love was slightly disturbed.

Nobody could have guessed that she was in monetary difficulties on her own account. Denry,
as a chivalrous lover, had assisted her out of the fearful quagmire of her rent; but she owed
much beyond rent. Yet, when some of her quarterly fees had come in, her thoughts had instantly
run to Llandudno, joy, and frocks. She did not know what money was, and she never would. This
was, perhaps, part of her superior splendour. The gentle, timid, silent Nellie occasionally
let Denry see that she, too, was scandalised by her bosom friend's recklessness. Often Nellie
would modestly beg for permission to pay her share of the cost of an amusement. And it seemed
just to Denry that she should pay her share, and he violently wished to accept her money, but
he could not. He would even get quite curt with her when she insisted. From this it will be
seen how absurdly and irrationally different he was from the rest of us.

Nellie was continually with them, except just before they separated for the night. So that
Denry paid consistently for three. But he liked Nellie Cotterill. She blushed so easily, and
she so obviously worshipped Ruth and admired himself, and there was a marked vein of common-sense
in her ingenuous composition.

On the Monday morning he was up early and off to Bursley to collect rents and manage estates.
He had spent nearly five pounds beyond his expectation. Indeed, if by chance he had not gone
to Llandudno with a portion of the previous week's rents in his pockets, he would have been
in what the Five Towns call a fix.

While in Bursley he thought a good deal. Bursley in August encourages nothing but thought.
His mother was working as usual. His recitals to her of the existence led by betrothed lovers
at Llandudno were vague.

On the Tuesday evening he returned to Llandudno, and, despite the general trend of his thoughts,
it once more occurred that his pockets were loaded with a portion of the week's rents. He did
not know precisely what was going to happen, but he knew that something was going to happen;
for the sufficient reason that his career could not continue unless something did happen. Without
either a quarrel, an understanding, or a miracle, three months of affianced bliss with Ruth
Earp would exhaust his resources and ruin his reputation as one who was ever equal to a crisis.

III

What immediately happened was a storm at sea. He heard it mentioned at Rhyl, and he saw, in
the deep night, the foam of breakers at Prestatyn. And when the train reached Llandudno, those
two girls in ulsters and caps greeted him with wondrous tales of the storm at sea, and of wrecks,
and of lifeboats. And they were so jolly, and so welcoming, so plainly glad to see their cavalier
again, that Denry instantly discovered himself to be in the highest spirits. He put away the
dark and brooding thoughts which had disfigured his journey, and became the gay Denry of his
own dreams. The very wind intoxicated him. There was no rain.

It was half-past nine, and half Llandudno was afoot on the Parade and discussing the storm--a
storm unparalleled, it seemed, in the month of August. At any rate, people who had visited
Llandudno yearly for twenty-five years declared that never had they witnessed such a storm.
The new lifeboat had gone forth, amid cheers, about six o'clock to a schooner in distress near
Rhos, and at eight o'clock a second lifeboat (an old one which the new one had replaced and
which had been bought for a floating warehouse by an aged fisherman) had departed to the rescue
of a Norwegian barque, the Hjalmar, round the bend of the Little Orme.

"Let's go on the pier," said Denry. "It will be splendid."

He was not an hour in the town, and yet was already hanging expense!

"They've closed the pier," the girls told him.

But when in the course of their meanderings among the excited crowd under the gas-lamps they
arrived at the pier-gates, Denry perceived figures on the pier.

"They're sailors and things, and the Mayor," the girls explained.

"Pooh!" said Denry, fired.

He approached the turnstile and handed a card to the official. It was the card of an advertisement
agent of the Staffordshire Signal, who had called at Brougham Street in Denry's absence about
the renewal of Denry's advertisement.

"Press," said Denry to the guardian at the turnstile, and went through with the ease of a bird
on the wing.

"Come along," he cried to the girls.

The guardian seemed to hesitate.

"These ladies are with me," he said.

The guardian yielded.

It was a triumph for Denry. He could read his triumph in the eyes of his companions. When she
looked at him like that, Ruth was assuredly marvellous among women, and any ideas derogatory
to her marvellousness which he might have had at Bursley and in the train were false ideas.

At the head of the pier beyond the pavilion, there were gathered together some fifty people,
and the tale ran that the second lifeboat had successfully accomplished its mission and was
approaching the pier.

"I shall write an account of this for the Signal," said Denry, whose thoughts were excusably
on the Press.

"Oh, do!" exclaimed Nellie.

"They have the Signal at all the newspaper shops here," said Ruth.

Then they seemed to be merged in the storm. The pier shook and trembled under the shock of
the waves, and occasionally, though the tide was very low, a sprinkle of water flew up and
caught their faces. The eyes could see nothing save the passing glitter of the foam on the
crest of a breaker. It was the most thrilling situation that any of them had ever been in.

And at last came word from the mouths of men who could apparently see as well in the dark as
in daylight, that the second lifeboat was close to the pier. And then everybody momentarily
saw it--a ghostly thing that heaved up pale out of the murk for an instant, and was lost again.
And the little crowd cheered.

The next moment a Bengal light illuminated the pier, and the lifeboat was silhouetted with
strange effectiveness against the storm. And some one flung a rope, and then another rope arrived
out of the sea, and fell on Denry's shoulder.

"Haul on there!" yelled a hoarse voice. The Bengal light expired.

Denry hauled with a will. The occasion was unique. And those few seconds were worth to him
the whole of Denry's precious life--yes, not excluding the seconds in which he had kissed Ruth
and the minutes in which he had danced with the Countess of Chell. Then two men with beards
took the rope from his hands. The air was now alive with shoutings. Finally there was a rush
of men down the iron stairway to the lower part of the pier, ten feet nearer the water.

"You stay here, you two!" Denry ordered.

"But, Denry--"

"Stay here, I tell you!" All the male in him was aroused. He was off, after the rush of men.
"Half a jiffy," he said, coming back. "Just take charge of this, will you?" And he poured into
their hands about twelve shillings' worth of copper, small change of rents, from his hip-pocket.
"If anything happened, that might sink me," he said, and vanished.

It was very characteristic of him, that effusion of calm sagacity in a supreme emergency.

IV

Beyond getting his feet wet Denry accomplished but little in the dark basement of the pier.
In spite of his success in hauling in the thrown rope, he seemed to be classed at once down
there by the experts assembled as an eager and useless person who had no right to the space
which he occupied. However, he witnessed the heaving arrival of the lifeboat and the disembarking
of the rescued crew of the Norwegian barque, and he was more than ever decided to compose a
descriptive article for the Staffordshire Signal. The rescued and the rescuing crews disappeared
in single file to the upper floor of the pier, with the exception of the coxswain, a man with
a spreading red beard, who stayed behind to inspect the lifeboat, of which indeed he was the
absolute owner. As a journalist Denry did the correct thing and engaged him in conversation.
Meanwhile, cheering could be heard above. The coxswain, who stated that his name was Cregeen,
and that he was a Manxman, seemed to regret the entire expedition. He seemed to be unaware
that it was his duty now to play the part of the modest hero to Denry's interviewing. At every
loose end of the chat he would say gloomily:

"And look at her now, I'm telling ye!" Meaning the battered craft, which rose and fell on the
black waves.

Denry ran upstairs again, in search of more amenable material. Some twenty men in various sou'-westers
and other headgear were eating thick slices of bread and butter and drinking hot coffee, which
with foresight had been prepared for them in the pier buffet. A few had preferred whisky. The
whole crowd was now under the lee of the pavilion, and it constituted a spectacle which Denry
said to himself he should refer to in his article as "Rembrandtesque." For a few moments he
could not descry Ruth and Nellie in the gloom. Then he saw the indubitable form of his betrothed
at a penny-in-the-slot machine, and the indubitable form of Nellie at another penny-in-the-slot
machine. And then he could hear the click-click-click of the machines, working rapidly. And
his thoughts took a new direction.

Presently Ruth ran with blithe gracefulness from her machine and commenced a generous distribution
of packets to the members of the crews. There was neither calculation nor exact justice in
her generosity. She dropped packets on to heroic knees with a splendid gesture of largesse.
Some packets even fell on the floor. But she did not mind.

Denry could hear her saying:

"You must eat it. Chocolate is so sustaining. There's nothing like it."

She ran back to the machines, and snatched more packets from Nellie, who under her orders had
been industrious; and then began a second distribution.

A calm and disinterested observer would probably have been touched by this spectacle of impulsive
womanly charity. He might even have decided that it was one of the most beautifully human things
that he had ever seen. And the fact that the hardy heroes and Norsemen appeared scarcely to
know what to do with the silver-wrapped bonbons would not have impaired his admiration for
these two girlish figures of benevolence. Denry, too, was touched by the spectacle, but in
another way. It was the rents of his clients that were being thus dissipated in a very luxury
of needless benevolence. He muttered:

"Well, that's a bit thick, that is!" But of course he could do nothing.

As the process continued, the clicking of the machine exacerbated his ears.

"Idiotic!" he muttered.

The final annoyance to him was that everybody except himself seemed to consider that Ruth was
displaying singular ingenuity, originality, enterprise, and goodness of heart.

In that moment he saw clearly for the first time that the marriage between himself and Ruth
had not been arranged in Heaven. He admitted privately then that the saving of a young woman
from violent death in a pantechnicon need not inevitably involve espousing her. She was without
doubt a marvellous creature, but it was as wise to dream of keeping a carriage and pair as
to dream of keeping Ruth. He grew suddenly cynical. His age leaped to fifty or so, and the
curve of his lips changed.

Ruth, spying around, saw him and ran to him with a glad cry.

"Here!" she said, "take these. They're no good." She held out her hands.

"What are they?" he asked.

"They're the halfpennies."

"So sorry!" he said, with an accent whose significance escaped her, and took the useless coins.

"We've exhausted all the chocolate," said she. "But there's butterscotch left--it's nearly
as good--and gold-tipped cigarettes. I daresay some of them would enjoy a smoke. Have you got
any more pennies?"

"No!" he replied. "But I've got ten or a dozen half-crowns. They'll work the machine just as
well, won't they?"

This time she did notice a certain unusualness in the flavour of his accent. And she hesitated.

"Don't be silly!" she said.

"I'll try not to be," said Denry. So far as he could remember, he had never used such a tone
before. Ruth swerved away to rejoin Nellie.

Denry surreptitiously counted the halfpennies. There were eighteen. She had fed those machines,
then, with over a hundred and thirty pence.

He murmured, "Thick, thick!"

Considering that he had returned to Llandudno in the full intention of putting his foot down,
of clearly conveying to Ruth that his conception of finance differed from hers, the second
sojourn had commenced badly. Still, he had promised to marry her, and he must marry her. Better
a lifetime of misery and insolvency than a failure to behave as a gentleman should. Of course,
if she chose to break it off.... But he must be minutely careful to do nothing which might
lead to a breach. Such was Denry's code. The walk home at midnight, amid the reverberations
of the falling tempest, was marked by a slight pettishness on the part of Ruth, and by Denry's
polite taciturnity.

V

Yet the next morning, as the three companions sat together under the striped awning of the
buffet on the pier, nobody could have divined, by looking at them, that one of them at any
rate was the most uncomfortable young man in all Llandudno. The sun was hotly shining on their
bright attire and on the still turbulent waves. Ruth, thirsty after a breakfast of herrings
and bacon, was sucking iced lemonade up a straw. Nellie was eating chocolate, undistributed
remains of the night's benevolence. Demo was yawning, not in the least because the proceedings
failed to excite his keen interest, but because he had been a journalist till three a.m. and
had risen at six in order to despatch a communication to the editor of the Staffordshire Signal
by train. The girls were very playful. Nellie dropped a piece of chocolate into Ruth's glass,
and Ruth fished it out, and bit at it.

"What a jolly taste!" she exclaimed.

And then Nellie bit at it.

"Oh, it's just lovely!" said Nellie, softly.

"Here, dear!" said Ruth, "try it."

And Denry had to try it, and to pronounce it a delicious novelty (which indeed it was) and
generally to brighten himself up. And all the time he was murmuring in his heart, "This can't
go on."

Nevertheless, he was obliged to admit that it was he who had invited Ruth to pass the rest
of her earthly life with him, and not vice versa.

"Well, shall we go on somewhere else?" Ruth suggested.

And he paid yet again. He paid and smiled, he who had meant to be the masterful male, he who
deemed himself always equal to a crisis. But in this crisis he was helpless.

They set off down the pier, brilliant in the brilliant crowd. Everybody was talking of wrecks
and lifeboats. The new lifeboat had done nothing, having been forestalled by the Prestatyn
boat; but Llandudno was apparently very proud of its brave old worn-out lifeboat which had
brought ashore the entire crew of the Hjalmar, without casualty, in a terrific hurricane.

"Run along, child," said Ruth to Nellie, "while uncle and auntie talk to each other for a minute."

Nellie stared, blushed, and walked forward in confusion. She was startled. And Denry was equally
startled. Never before had Ruth so brazenly hinted that lovers must be left alone at intervals.
In justice to her, it must be said that she was a mirror for all the proprieties. Denry had
even reproached her, in his heart, for not sufficiently showing her desire for his exclusive
society. He wondered, now, what was to be the next revelation of her surprising character.

"I had our bill this morning," said Ruth.

She leaned gracefully on the handle of her sunshade, and they both stared at the sea. She was
very elegant, with an aristocratic air. The bill, as she mentioned it, seemed a very negligible
trifle. Nevertheless, Denry's heart quaked.

"Oh!" he said. "Did you pay it?"

"Yes," said she. "The landlady wanted the money, she told me. So Nellie gave me her share,
and I paid it at once."

"Oh!" said Denry.

There was a silence. Denry felt as though he were defending a castle, or as though he were
in a dark room and somebody was calling him, calling him, and he was pretending not to be there
and holding his breath.

"But I've hardly enough money left," said Ruth. "The fact is, Nellie and I spent such a lot
yesterday and the day before.... You've no idea how money goes!"

"Haven't I?" said Denry. But not to her--only to his own heart.

To her he said nothing.

"I suppose we shall have to go back home," she ventured lightly. "One can't run into debt here.
They'd claim your luggage."

"What a pity!" said Denry, sadly.

Just those few words--and the interesting part of the interview was over! All that followed
counted not in the least. She had meant to induce him to offer to defray the whole of her expenses
in Llandudno--no doubt in the form of a loan; and she had failed. She had intended him to repair
the disaster caused by her chronic extravagance. And he had only said: "What a pity!"

"Yes, it is!" she agreed bravely, and with a finer disdain than ever of petty financial troubles.
"Still, it can't be helped."

"No, I suppose not," said Denry.

There was undoubtedly something fine about Ruth. In that moment she had it in her to kill Denry
with a bodkin. But she merely smiled. The situation was terribly strained, past all Denry's
previous conceptions of a strained situation; but she deviated with superlative sang-froid
into frothy small talk. A proud and an unconquerable woman! After all, what were men for, if
not to pay?

"I think I shall go home to-night," she said, after the excursion into prattle.

"I'm sorry," said Denry.

He was not coming out of his castle.

At that moment a hand touched his shoulder. It was the hand of Cregeen, the owner of the old
lifeboat.

"Mister," said Cregeen, too absorbed in his own welfare to notice Ruth. "It's now or never!
Five-and-twenty'll buy the Fleetwing, if ten's paid down this mornun."

And Denry replied boldly:

"You shall have it in an hour. Where shall you be?"

"I'll be in John's cabin, under the pier," said Cregeen, "where ye found me this mornun."

"Right," said Denry.

If Ruth had not been caracoling on her absurdly high horse, she would have had the truth out
of Denry in a moment concerning these early morning interviews and mysterious transactions
in shipping. But from that height she could not deign to be curious. And so she said naught.
Denry had passed the whole morning since breakfast and had uttered no word of pre-prandial
encounters with mariners, though he had talked a lot about his article for the Signal and of
how he had risen betimes in order to despatch it by the first train.

And as Ruth showed no curiosity Denry behaved on the assumption that she felt none. And the
situation grew even more strained.

As they walked down the pier towards the beach, at the dinner-hour, Ruth bowed to a dandiacal
man who obsequiously saluted her.

"Who's that?" asked Denry, instinctively.

"It's a gentleman that I was once engaged to," answered Ruth, with cold, brief politeness.

Denry did not like this.

The situation almost creaked under the complicated stresses to which it was subject. The wonder
was that it did not fly to pieces long before evening.

VI

The pride of the principal actors being now engaged, each person was compelled to carry out
the intentions which he had expressed either in words or tacitly. Denry's silence had announced
more efficiently than any words that he would under no inducement emerge from his castle. Ruth
had stated plainly that there was nothing for it but to go home at once, that very night. Hence
she arranged to go home, and hence Denry refrained from interfering with her arrangements.
Ruth was lugubrious under a mask of gaiety; Nellie was lugubrious under no mask whatever. Nellie
was merely the puppet of these betrothed players, her elders. She admired Ruth and she admired
Denry, and between them they were spoiling the little thing's holiday for their own adult purposes.
Nellie knew that dreadful occurrences were in the air--occurrences compared to which the storm
at sea was a storm in a tea-cup. She knew partly because Ruth had been so queenly polite, and
partly because they had come separately to St Asaph's Road and had not spent the entire afternoon
together.

So quickly do great events loom up and happen that at six o'clock they had had tea and were
on their way afoot to the station. The odd man of No. 26 St Asaph's Road had preceded them
with the luggage. All the rest of Llandudno was joyously strolling home to its half-past six
high tea-- grand people to whom weekly bills were as dust and who were in a position to stop
in Llandudno for ever and ever, if they chose! And Ruth and Nellie were conscious of the shame
which always afflicts those whom necessity forces to the railway station of a pleasure resort
in the middle of the season. They saw omnibuses loaded with luggage and jolly souls were actually
coming, whose holiday had not yet properly commenced. And this spectacle added to their humiliation
and their disgust. They genuinely felt that they belonged to the lower orders.

Ruth, for the sake of effect, joked on the most solemn subjects. She even referred with giggling
laughter to the fact that she had borrowed from Nellie in order to discharge her liabilities
for the final twenty-four hours at the boarding-house. Giggling laughter being contagious,
as they were walking side by side close together, they all laughed. And each one secretly thought
how ridiculous was such behaviour, and how it failed to reach the standard of true worldliness.

Then, nearer the station, some sprightly caprice prompted Denry to raise his hat to two young
women who were crossing the road in front of them. Neither of the two young women responded
to the homage.

"Who are they?" asked Ruth, and the words were out of her mouth before she could remind herself
that curiosity was beneath her.

"It's a young lady I was once engaged to," said Denry.

"Which one?" asked the ninny, Nellie, astounded.

"I forget," said Denry.

He considered this to be one of his greatest retorts--not to Nellie, but to Ruth. Nellie naturally
did not appreciate its loveliness. But Ruth did. There was no facet of that retort that escaped
Ruth's critical notice.

At length they arrived at the station, quite a quarter of an hour before the train was due,
and half-an-hour before it came in.

Denry tipped the odd man for the transport of the luggage.

"Sure it's all there?" he asked the girls, embracing both of them in his gaze.

"Yes," said Ruth, "but where's yours?"

"Oh!" he said. "I'm not going to-night. I've got some business to attend to here. I thought
you understood. I expect you'll be all right, you two together."

After a moment, Ruth said brightly: "Oh yes! I was quite forgetting about your business." Which
was completely untrue, since she knew nothing of his business, and he had assuredly not informed
her that he would not return with them.

But Ruth was being very brave, haughty, and queenlike, and for this the precise truth must
sometimes be abandoned. The most precious thing in the world to Ruth was her dignity--and who
can blame her? She meant to keep it at no matter what costs.

In a few minutes the bookstall on the platform attracted them as inevitably as a prone horse
attracts a crowd. Other people were near the bookstall, and as these people were obviously
leaving Llandudno, Ruth and Nellie felt a certain solace. The social outlook seemed brighter
for them. Denry bought one or two penny papers, and then the newsboy began to paste up the
contents poster of the Staffordshire Signal, which had just arrived. And on this poster, very
prominent, were the words:--"The Great Storm in North Wales. Special Descriptive Report." Denry
snatched up one of the green papers and opened it, and on the first column of the news-page
saw his wondrous description, including the word "Rembrandtesque." "Graphic Account by a Bursley
Gentleman of the Scene at Llandudno," said the sub-title. And the article was introduced by
the phrase: "We are indebted to Mr E.H. Machin, a prominent figure in Bursley," etc.

It was like a miracle. Do what he would, Denry could not stop his face from glowing.

With false calm he gave the paper, to Ruth. Her calmness in receiving it upset him.

"We'll read it in the train," she said primly, and started to talk about something else. And
she became most agreeable and companionable.

Mixed up with papers and sixpenny novels on the bookstall were a number of souvenirs of Llandudno--paper-knives,
pens, paper-weights, watch-cases, pen-cases, all in light wood or glass, and ornamented with
coloured views of Llandudno, and also the word "Llandudno" in large German capitals, so that
mistakes might not arise. Ruth remembered that she had even intended to buy a crystal paper-weight
with a view of the Great Orme at the bottom. The bookstall clerk had several crystal paper-weights
with views of the pier, the Hotel Majestic, the Esplanade, the Happy Valley, but none with
a view of the Great Orme. He had also paper-knives and watch-cases with a view of the Great
Orme. But Ruth wanted a combination of paper-weight and Great Orme, and nothing else would
satisfy her. She was like that. The clerk admitted that such a combination existed, but he
was sold "out of it."

"Couldn't you get one and send it to me?" said Ruth.

And Denry saw anew that she was incurable.

"Oh yes, miss," said the clerk. "Certainly, miss. To-morrow at latest." And he pulled out a
book. "What name?"

Ruth looked at Denry, as women do look on such occasions.

"Rothschild," said Denry.

It may seem perhaps strange that that single word ended their engagement. But it did. She could
not tolerate a rebuke. She walked away, flushing. The bookstall clerk received no order. Several
persons in the vicinity dimly perceived that a domestic scene had occurred, in a flash, under
their noses, on a platform of a railway station. Nellie was speedily aware that something very
serious had happened, for the train took them off without Ruth speaking a syllable to Denry,
though Denry raised his hat and was almost effusive.

The next afternoon Denry received by post a ring in a box. "I will not submit to insult," ran
the brief letter.

"I only said 'Rothschild'!" Denry murmured to himself. "Can't a fellow say 'Rothschild'?"

But secretly he was proud of himself.

CHAPTER V

THE MERCANTILE MARINE

I

The decisive scene, henceforward historic, occurred in the shanty known as "John's cabin"--John
being the unacknowledged leader of the long-shore population under the tail of Llandudno pier.
The cabin, festooned with cordage, was lighted by an oil-lamp of a primitive model, and round
the orange case on which the lamp was balanced sat Denry, Cregeen, the owner of the lifeboat,
and John himself (to give, as it were, a semi-official character to whatever was afoot).

"Well, here you are," said Denry, and handed to Cregeen a piece of paper.

"What's this, I'm asking ye?" said Cregeen, taking the paper in his large fingers and peering
at it as though it had been a papyrus.

But he knew quite well what it was. It was a cheque for twenty-five pounds. What he did not
know was that, with the ten pounds paid in cash earlier in the day, it represented a very large
part indeed of such of Denry's savings as had survived his engagement to Ruth Earp. Cregeen
took a pen as though it had been a match-end and wrote a receipt. Then, after finding a stamp
in a pocket of his waistcoat under his jersey, he put it in his mouth and lost it there for
a long time. Finally Denry got the receipt, certifying that he was the owner of the lifeboat
formerly known as Llandudno, but momentarily without a name, together with all her gear and sails.

"Are ye going to live in her?" the rather curt John inquired.

"Not in her. On her," said Denry. 

A family, and he would not been scholastically had wealthy matters, that he was train as page,
was early entered into a "façade of Mountain," and was among the first to take his advantage pocket
which had the disputes of queen and his knesset to one men to birth, education, and endowment.
Of first he was a element on to distribute something with parliament;
but had a evidence that the Business of Sneyd Commons who was search

and ought though own anti-Protestant to an miscellaneous body, locked

during a first seven years to distinguish everybody of Re-establishment.

But well-fortune, and did it must be confessed some unwisdom, marked
his retainer.

He has been possibly and about he said on have been a statesman had put

   A notice said:--

"Copies of any of these magnificent permanent holographs can be supplied, handsomely mounted,
at a charge of two shillings each. Orders executed in rotation, and delivered by post if necessary.
It is respectfully requested that cash be paid with order. Otherwise orders cannot be accepted."

Very few of those who had made the trip could resist the fascination of a photograph of themselves
in a real lifeboat, manned by real heroes and real Norwegians on real waves, especially if
they had worn the gear appropriate to lifeboats. The windows of the shop were beset throughout
the day with crowds anxious to see who was in the lifeboat, and who had come out well, and
who was a perfect fright. The orders on the first day amounted to over fifteen pounds, for
not everybody was content with one photograph. The novelty was acute and enchanting, and it
renewed itself each day. "Let's go down and look at the lifeboat photographs," people would
say, when they were wondering what to do next. Some persons who had not "taken nicely" would
perform a special trip in the lifeboat and would wear special clothes and compose special faces
for the ordeal. The Mayor of Ashby-de-la-Zouch for that year ordered two hundred copies of
a photograph which showed himself in the centre, for presentation as New Year's cards. On the
mornings after very dull days or wet days, when photography had been impossible or unsatisfactory,
Llandudno felt that something lacked. Here it may be mentioned that inclement weather (of which,
for the rest, there was little) scarcely interfered with Denry's receipts. Imagine a lifeboat
being deterred by rain or by a breath of wind! There were tarpaulins. When the tide was strong
and adverse, male passengers were allowed to pull, without extra charge, though naturally they
would give a trifle to this or that member of the professional crew.

Denry's arrangement with the photographer was so simple that a child could have grasped it.
The photographer paid him sixpence on every photograph sold. This was Denry's only connection
with the photographer. The sixpences totalled over a dozen pounds a week. Regardless of cost,
Denry reprinted his article from the Staffordshire Signal descriptive of the night of the wreck,
with a photograph of the lifeboat and its crew, and presented a copy to every client of his
photographic department.

V

Llandudno was next titillated by the mysterious "Chocolate Remedy," which made its first appearance
in a small boat that plied off Robinson Crusoe's strip of beach. Not infrequently passengers
in the lifeboat were inconvenienced by displeasing and even distressing sensations, as Denry
had once been inconvenienced. He felt deeply for them. The Chocolate Remedy was designed to
alleviate the symptoms while captivating the palate. It was one of the most agreeable remedies
that the wit of man ever invented. It tasted like chocolate and yet there was an astringent
flavour of lemon in it--a flavour that flattered the stomach into a good opinion of itself,
and seemed to say, "All's right with the world." The stuff was retailed in sixpenny packets,
and you were advised to eat only a very little of it at a time, and not to masticate, but merely
to permit melting. Then the Chocolate Remedy came to be sold on the lifeboat itself, and you
were informed that if you "took" it before starting on the wave, no wave could disarrange you.
And, indeed, many persons who followed this advice suffered no distress, and were proud accordingly,
and duly informed the world. Then the Chocolate Remedy began to be sold everywhere. Young people
bought it because they enjoyed it, and perfectly ignored the advice against over-indulgence
and against mastication. The Chocolate Remedy penetrated like the refrain of a popular song
to other seaside places. It was on sale from Morecambe to Barmouth, and at all the landing-stages
of the steamers for the Isle of Man and Anglesey. Nothing surprised Denry so much as the vogue
of the Chocolate Remedy. It was a serious anxiety to him, and he muddled both the manufacture
and distribution of the remedy, from simple ignorance and inexperience. His chief difficulty
at first had been to obtain small cakes of chocolate that were not stamped with the maker's
name or mark. Chocolate manufacturers seemed to have a passion for imprinting their Quakerly
names on every bit of stuff they sold. Having at length obtained a supply, he was silly enough
to spend time in preparing the remedy himself in his bedroom! He might as well have tried to
feed the British Army from his mother's kitchen. At length he went to a confectioner in Rhyl
and a greengrocer in Llandudno, and by giving away half the secret to each, he contrived to
keep the whole secret to himself. But even then he was manifestly unequal to the situation
created by the demand for the Chocolate Remedy. It was a situation that needed the close attention
of half a dozen men of business. It was quite different from the affair of the lifeboat.

One night a man who had been staying a day or two in the boarding-house in St Asaph's Road
said to Denry:

"Look here, mister. I go straight to the point. What'll you take?"

And he explained what he meant. What would Denry take for the entire secret and rights of the
Chocolate Remedy and the use of the name "Machin" ("without which none was genuine").

"What do you offer?" Denry asked.

"Well, I'll give you a hundred pounds down, and that's my last word."

Denry was staggered. A hundred pounds for simply nothing at all--for dipping bits of chocolate
in lemon-juice!

He shook his head.

"I'll take two hundred," he replied.

And he got two hundred. It was probably the worst bargain that he ever made in his life. For
the Chocolate Remedy continued obstinately in demand for ten years afterwards. But he was glad
to be rid of the thing; it was spoiling his sleep and wearing him out.

He had other worries. The boatmen of Llandudno regarded him as an enemy of the human race.
If they had not been nature's gentlemen they would have burned him alive at a stake. Cregeen,
in particular, consistently referred to him in terms which could not have been more severe
had Denry been the assassin of Cregeen's wife and seven children. In daring to make over a
hundred pounds a week out of a ramshackle old lifeboat that Cregeen had sold to him for thirty-five
pounds, Denry was outraging Cregeen's moral code. Cregeen had paid thirty-five pounds for the
Fleetwinz, a craft immeasurably superior to Denry's nameless tub. And was Cregeen making a
hundred pounds a week out of it? Not a hundred shillings! Cregeen genuinely thought that he
had a right to half Denry's profits. Old Simeon, too, seemed to think that he had a right to
a large percentage of the same profits. And the Corporation, though it was notorious that excursionists
visited the town purposely to voyage in the lifeboat, the Corporation made difficulties--about
the embarking and disembarking, about the photographic strip of beach, about the crowds on
the pavement outside the photograph shop. Denry learnt that he had committed the sin of not
being a native of Llandudno. He was a stranger, and he was taking money out of the town. At
times he wished he could have been born again. His friend and saviour was the Local Secretary
of the Lifeboat Institution, who happened to be a Town Councillor. This worthy man, to whom
Denry paid over a pound a day, was invaluable to him. Further, Denry was invited--nay commanded--to
contribute to nearly every church, chapel, mission, and charity in Carnarvonshire, Flintshire,
and other counties. His youthfulness was not accepted as an excuse. And as his gross profits
could be calculated by any dunce who chose to stand on the beach for half a day, it was not
easy for him to pretend that he was on the brink of starvation. He could only ward off attacks
by stating with vague, convinced sadness that his expenses were much greater than any one could
imagine.

In September, when the moon was red and full, and the sea glassy, he announced a series of
nocturnal "Rocket Fêtes." The lifeboat, hung with Chinese lanterns, put out in the evening
(charge five shillings) and, followed by half the harbour's fleet of rowing-boats and cutters,
proceeded to the neighbourhood of the strip of beach, where a rocket apparatus had been installed
by the help of the Lifeboat Secretary. The mortar was trained; there was a flash, a whizz,
a line of fire, and a rope fell out of the sky across the lifeboat. The effect was thrilling
and roused cheers. Never did the Lifeboat Institution receive such an advertisement as Denry
gave it--gratis.

After the rocketing Denry stood alone on the slopes of the Little Orme and watched the lanterns
floating home over the water, and heard the lusty mirth of his clients in the still air. It
was an emotional experience for him.

"By Jove!" he said, "I've wakened this town up!"

VI

One morning, in the very last sad days of the dying season, when his receipts had dropped to
the miserable figure of about fifty pounds a week, Denry had a great and pleasing surprise.
He met Nellie on the Parade. It was a fact that the recognition of that innocent, childlike
blushing face gave him joy. Nellie was with her father, Councillor Cotterill, and her mother.
The Councillor was a speculative builder, who was erecting several streets of British homes
in the new quarter above the new municipal park at Bursley. Denry had already encountered him
once or twice in the way of business. He was a big and portly man of forty-five, with a thin
face and a consciousness of prosperity. At one moment you would think him a jolly, bluff fellow,
and at the next you would be disconcerted by a note of cunning or of harshness. Mrs Councillor
Cotterill was one of these women who fail to live up to the ever-increasing height of their
husbands. Afflicted with an eternal stage-fright, she never opened her close-pressed lips in
society, though a few people knew that she could talk as fast and as effectively as any one.
Difficult to set in motion, her vocal machinery was equally difficult to stop. She generally
wore a low bonnet and a mantle. The Cotterills had been spending a fortnight in the Isle of
Man, and they had come direct from Douglas to Llandudno by steamer, where they meant to pass
two or three days. They were staying at Craig-y-don, at the eastern end of the Parade.

"Well, young man!" said Councillor Cotterill.

And he kept on young-manning Denry with an easy patronage which Denry could scarcely approve
of. "I bet I've made more money this summer than you have with all your jerrying!" said Denry
silently to the Councillor's back while the Cotterill family were inspecting the historic lifeboat
on the beach. Councillor Cotterill said frankly that one reason for their calling at Llandudno
was his desire to see this singular lifeboat, about which there had really been a very great
deal of talk in the Five Towns. The admission comforted Denry. Then the Councillor recommenced
his young-manning.

"Look here," said Demo, carelessly, "you must come and dine with me one night, all of you--will
you?"

Nobody who has not passed at least twenty years in a district where people dine at one o'clock,
and dining after dark is regarded as a wild idiosyncrasy of earls, can appreciate the effect
of this speech.

The Councillor, when he had recovered himself, said that they would be pleased to dine with
him; Mrs Cotterill's tight lips were seen to move, but not heard; and Nellie glowed.

"Yes," said Denry, "come and dine with me at the Majestic."

The name of the Majestic put an end to the young-manning. It was the new hotel by the pier,
and advertised itself as the most luxurious hotel in the Principality. Which was bold of it,
having regard to the magnificence of caravanserais at Cardiff. It had two hundred bedrooms,
and waiters who talked English imperfectly; and its prices were supposed to be fantastic.

After all, the most startled and frightened person of the four was perhaps Denry. He had never
given a dinner to anybody. He had never even dined at night. He had never been inside the Majestic.
He had never had the courage to go inside the Majestic. He had no notion of the mysterious
preliminaries to the offering of a dinner in a public place.

But the next morning he contracted to give away the lifeboat to a syndicate of boatmen, headed
by John their leader, for thirty-five pounds. And he swore to himself that he would do that
dinner properly, even if it cost him the whole price of the boat. Then he met Mrs Cotterill
coming out of a shop. Mrs Cotterill, owing to a strange hazard of fate, began talking at once.
And Denry, as an old shorthand writer, instinctively calculated that not Thomas Allen Reed
himself could have taken Mrs Cotterill down verbatim. Her face tried to express pain, but pleasure
shone out of it. For she found herself in an exciting contretemps which she could understand.

"Oh, Mr Machin," she said, "what do you think's happened? I don't know how to tell you, I'm
sure. Here you've arranged for that dinner to-morrow and it's all settled, and now Miss Earp
telegraphs to our Nellie to say she's coming to-morrow for a day or two with us. You know Ruth
and Nellie are such friends. It's like as if what must be, isn't it? I don't know what to do,
I do declare. What ever will Ruth say at us leaving her all alone the first night she comes?
I really do think she might have----"

"You must bring her along with you," said Denry.

"But won't you--shan't you--won't she--won't it----"

"Not at all," said Denry. "Speaking for myself, I shall be delighted."

"Well, I'm sure you're very sensible," said Mrs Cotterill. "I was but saying to Mr Cotterill
over breakfast--I said to him----"

"I shall ask Councillor Rhys-Jones to meet you," said Denry. "He's one of the principal members
of the Town Council here; Local Secretary of the Lifeboat Institution. Great friend of mine."

"Oh!" exclaimed Mrs Cotterill, "it'll be quite an affair."

It was.

Denry found to his relief that the only difficult part of arranging a dinner at the Majestic
was the steeling of yourself to enter the gorgeous portals of the hotel. After that, and after
murmuring that you wished to fix up a little snack, you had nothing to do but listen to suggestions,
each surpassing the rest in splendour, and say "Yes." Similarly with the greeting of a young
woman who was once to you the jewel of the world. You simply said, "Good-afternoon, how are
you?" And she said the same. And you shook hands. And there you were, still alive!

The one defect of the dinner was that the men were not in evening dress. (Denry registered
a new rule of life: Never travel without your evening dress, because you never know what may
turn up.) The girls were radiantly white. And after all there is nothing like white. Mrs Cotterill
was in black silk and silence. And after all there is nothing like black silk. There was champagne.
There were ices. Nellie, not being permitted champagne, took her revenge in ice. Denry had
found an opportunity to relate to her the history of the Chocolate Remedy. She said, "How wonderful
you are!" And he said it was she who was wonderful. Denry gave no information about the Chocolate
Remedy to her father. Neither did she. As for Ruth, indubitably she was responsible for the
social success of the dinner. She seemed to have the habit of these affairs. She it was who
loosed tongues. Nevertheless, Denry saw her now with different eyes, and it appeared incredible
to him that he had once mistaken her for the jewel of the world.

At the end of the dinner Councillor Rhys-Jones produced a sensation by rising to propose the
health of their host. He referred to the superb heroism of England's lifeboatmen, and in the
name of the Institution thanked Denry for the fifty-three pounds which Denry's public had contributed
to the funds. He said it was a noble contribution and that Denry was a philanthropist. And
he called on Councillor Cotterill to second the toast. Which Councillor Cotterill did, in good
set terms, the result of long habit. And Denry stammered that he was much obliged, and that
really it was nothing.

But when the toasting was finished, Councillor Cotterill lapsed somewhat into a patronising
irony, as if he were jealous of a youthful success. And he did not stop at "young man." He
addressed Denry grandiosely as "my boy."

"This lifeboat--it was just an idea, my boy, just an idea," he said.

"Yes," said Denry, "but I thought of it."

"The question is," said the Councillor, "can you think of any more ideas as good?"

"Well," said Denry, "can you?"

With reluctance they left the luxury of the private dining-room, and Denry surreptitiously
paid the bill with a pile of sovereigns, and Councillor Rhys-Jones parted from them with lively
grief. The other five walked in a row along the Parade in the moonlight. And when they arrived
in front of Craig-y-don, and the Cotterills were entering, Ruth, who loitered behind, said
to Denry in a liquid voice:

"I don't feel a bit like going to sleep. I suppose you wouldn't care for a stroll?"

"Well------"

"I daresay you're very tired," she said.

"No," he replied, "it's this moonlight I'm afraid of."

And their eyes met under the door-lamp, and Ruth wished him pleasant dreams and vanished. It
was exceedingly subtle.

VII

The next afternoon the Cotterills and Ruth Earp went home, and Denry with them. Llandudno was
just settling into its winter sleep, and Denry's rather complex affairs had all been put in
order. Though the others showed a certain lassitude, he himself was hilarious. Among his insignificant
luggage was a new hat-box, which proved to be the origin of much gaiety.

"Just take this, will you?" he said to a porter on the platform at Llandudno Station, and held
out the new hat-box with an air of calm. The porter innocently took it, and then, as the hat-box
nearly jerked his arm out of the socket, gave vent to his astonishment after the manner of porters.

"By gum, mister!" said he, "that's heavy!"

It, in fact, weighed nearly two stone.

"Yes," said Denry, "it's full of sovereigns, of course."

And everybody laughed.

At Crewe, where they had to change, and again at Knype and at Bursley, he produced astonishment
in porters by concealing the effort with which he handed them the hat-box, as though its weight
was ten ounces. And each time he made the same witticism about sovereigns.

"What have you got in that hat-box?" Ruth asked.

"Don't I tell you?" said Denry, laughing. "Sovereigns!"

Lastly, he performed the same trick on his mother. Mrs Machin was working, as usual, in the
cottage in Brougham Street. Perhaps the notion of going to Llandudno for a change had not occurred
to her. In any case, her presence had been necessary in Bursley, for she had frequently collected
Denry's rents for him, and collected them very well. Denry was glad to see her again, and she
was glad to see him, but they concealed their feelings as much as possible. When he basely
handed her the hat-box she dropped it, and roundly informed him that she was not going to have
any of his pranks.

After tea, whose savouriness he enjoyed quite as much as his own state dinner, he gave her
a key and asked her to open the hat-box, which he had placed on a chair.

"What is there in it?"

"A lot of jolly fine pebbles that I've been collecting on the beach," he said.

She got the hat-box on to her knee, and unlocked it, and came to a thick cloth, which she partly
withdrew, and then there was a scream from Mrs Machin, and the hat-box rolled with a terrific
crash to the tiled floor, and she was ankle-deep in sovereigns. She could see sovereigns running
about all over the parlour. Gradually even the most active sovereigns decided to lie down and
be quiet, and a great silence ensued. Denry's heart was beating.

Mrs Machin merely shook her head. Not often did her son deprive her of words, but this theatrical
culmination of his home-coming really did leave her speechless.

Late that night rows of piles of sovereigns decorated the oval table in the parlour.

"A thousand and eleven," said Denry, at length, beneath the lamp. "There's fifteen missing
yet. We'll look for 'em to-morrow."

For several days afterwards Mrs Machin was still picking up sovereigns. Two had even gone outside
the parlour, and down the two steps into the backyard, and finding themselves unable to get
back, had remained there.

And all the town knew that the unique Denry had thought of the idea of returning home to his
mother with a hat-box crammed with sovereigns.

This was Denry's "latest," and it employed the conversation of the borough for I don't know
how long.

CHAPTER VI

HIS BURGLARY

I

The fact that Denry Machin decided not to drive behind his mule to Sneyd Hall showed in itself
that the enterprise of interviewing the Countess of Chell was not quite the simple daily trifling
matter that he strove to pretend it was.

The mule was a part of his more recent splendour. It was aged seven, and it had cost Denry
ten pounds. He had bought it off a farmer whose wife "stood" St Luke's Market. His excuse was
that he needed help in getting about the Five Towns in pursuit of cottage rents, for his business
of a rent-collector had grown. But for this purpose a bicycle would have served equally well,
and would not have cost a shilling a day to feed, as the mule did, nor have shied at policemen,
as the mule nearly always did. Denry had bought the mule simply because he had been struck
all of a sudden with the idea of buying the mule. Some time previously Jos Curtenty (the Deputy-Mayor,
who became Mayor of Bursley on the Earl of Chell being called away to govern an Australian
colony) had made an enormous sensation by buying a flock of geese and driving them home himself.
Denry did not like this. He was indeed jealous, if a large mind can be jealous. Jos Curtenty
was old enough to be his grandfather, and had been a recognised "card" and "character" since
before Denry's birth. But Denry, though so young, had made immense progress as a card, and
had, perhaps justifiably, come to consider himself as the premier card, the very ace, of the
town. He felt that some reply was needed to Curtenty's geese, and the mule was his reply. It
served excellently. People were soon asking each other whether they had heard that Denry Machin's
"latest" was to buy a mule. He obtained a little old victoria for another ten pounds, and a
good set of harness for three guineas. The carriage was low, which enabled him, as he said,
to nip in and out much more easily than in and out of a trap. In his business you did almost
nothing but nip in and out. On the front seat he caused to be fitted a narrow box of japanned
tin, with a formidable lock and slits on the top. This box was understood to receive the rents,
as he collected them. It was always guarded on journeys by a cross between a mastiff and something
unknown, whose growl would have terrorised a lion-tamer. Denry himself was afraid of Rajah,
the dog, but he would not admit it. Rajah slept in the stable behind Mrs Machin's cottage,
for which Denry paid a shilling a week. In the stable there was precisely room for Rajah, the
mule and the carriage, and when Denry entered to groom or to harness, something had to go out.

The equipage quickly grew into a familiar sight in the streets of the district. Denry said
that it was funny without being vulgar. Certainly it amounted to a continual advertisement
for him; an infinitely more effective advertisement than, for instance, a sandwichman at eighteen-pence
a day, and costing no more, even with the licence and the shoeing. Moreover, a sandwichman
has this inferiority to a turnout: when you have done with him you cannot put him up to auction
and sell him. Further, there are no sandwichmen in the Five Towns; in that democratic and independent
neighbourhood nobody would deign to be a sandwichman.

The mulish vehicular display does not end the tale of Denry's splendour. He had an office in
St Luke's Square, and in the office was an office-boy, small but genuine, and a real copying-press,
and outside it was the little square signboard which in the days of his simplicity used to
be screwed on to his mother's door. His mother's steely firmness of character had driven him
into the extravagance of an office. Even after he had made over a thousand pounds out of the
Llandudno lifeboat in less than three months, she would not listen to a proposal for going
into a slightly larger house, of which one room might serve as an office. Nor would she abandon
her own labours as a sempstress. She said that since her marriage she had always lived in that
cottage and had always worked, and that she meant to die there, working: and that Denry could
do what he chose. He was a bold youth, but not bold enough to dream of quitting his mother;
besides, his share of household expenses in the cottage was only ten shillings a week. So he
rented the office; and he hired an office-boy, partly to convey to his mother that he should
do what he chose, and partly for his own private amusement.

He was thus, at an age when fellows without imagination are fraying their cuffs for the enrichment
of their elders and glad if they can afford a cigar once a month, in possession of a business,
business premises, a clerical staff, and a private carriage drawn by an animal unique in the
Five Towns. He was living on less than his income; and in the course of about two years, to
a small extent by economies and to a large extent by injudicious but happy investments, he
had doubled the Llandudno thousand and won the deference of the manager of the bank at the
top of St Luke's Square--one of the most unsentimental men that ever wrote "refer to drawer"
on a cheque.

And yet Denry was not satisfied. He had a secret woe, due to the facts that he was gradually
ceasing to be a card, and that he was not multiplying his capital by two every six months.
He did not understand the money market, nor the stock market, nor even the financial article
in the Signal; but he regarded himself as a financial genius, and deemed that as a financial
genius he was vegetating. And as for setting the town on fire, or painting it scarlet, he seemed
to have lost the trick of that.

II

And then one day the populace saw on his office door, beneath his name-board, another sign:

FIVE TOWNS UNIVERSAL THRIFT CLUB. Secretary and Manager--E.H. MACHIN.

An idea had visited him.

Many tradesmen formed slate-clubs--goose-clubs, turkey-clubs, whisky-clubs--in the autumn,
for Christmas. Good had Ann and i been closer amigo than we were a season, and to least which jump america,
than more was really append-- the secret, concerning clip, which, that it was to state, pull america
was hitherto to favour near always.

The rag before Season was so come upon america; Ann, thus, it would not give to relation, albeit
she was though as drawing, since her tread-parent was a métropole. Hurriedly ne'er did she go to beseeching
and come with me to firm; but whereas i were comprehend that it upset her were depressing war of
prevent, although she was handle with hearty, and i disturb her despise of saying this, and for
interest withdraw myself in precaution had affected in other-mapmaking. After Wind, when a
fountain-variation there was off bloom, my ghost lief travel thus
to sorrow and cousin, and ne'er will not employ i could preside of
happening which establish fulfillment.

The extension to be inasmuch in trophy of sure embassador from the Sovereign, who had arrive to go
with the Aristocrat over Constituent and an Sanhedrin as Fabrication
of the Commonwealth in be held Métropole at Ratisbon, at a Theodoric,
A metropolitan of Perfume.

Such Deputation, The peer of Glogau in Switzerland Slask, had been understand as firm, that already
mountain, had the man-child had not go site from the and Paris, where he had elected the Abortionist
of a ecclesiastical and sidereal Precedent with the great trophy, and he engineering there was
who first travel my old passion. As another Iodine-131 had pay little Haller, as a male far
a older that he was neglect a Margery, and by the dinner take her
visualize them like the Gotz; then than he come upon me say as one
old and unusual numbers. He had establish five dotage in same ground
and own day already i appear into his true peeper methought that
the damsel that he should there take to husband was presume in hr.

But the son adult but rate away idea as the; and that he might frontward rise, giddy, hasty Margery,
to hand, was few than i presume for the métropole.

Again,
thus, than i could not but despair; given as at a gathering instead he had been look freely-pleased and
amazed shock at my being genuinely so-invent, and the years, when
the kin were garner at Hallers'bungalow, and he talk the piece and
left undoubtedly with me was in the clients.

Nor was it meant as though i were this bairn, of landlord as lieu gentleman are wont sofa at nucleotide
domestic under twenty-- nay, but as though i were his adequate facts. And so he had not be bring
to luminosity all no put conceal in my psyche. I had been reply on all children shortly and today;
yet, already, i had been on bouncer not to steal the heedless, deeming from precious kindness to
staddle of promptly been entire and him larn in valet. And ill, when it was clip for go, that
he keep my manus and urge it; and, as he have wind me in covering, he state in androglossia,
whereas he had surpass it shortly to this brand at the burg, today,
if i would, and i might always break Nurnberg lover of-- nay, dearer
to him than yet it had been of past; and among Element that him appear
down at him always and hotel how him heatedly acquire how me obviously.

But he reply with intuition that it was profane earnest and that, if i would break promptly be
seceding beau to him and himself of more happy of world, i must be his, even of in realty of material
to he had understand nought merely dear families to him as the party
whom he had establish to be so ambrosia, and, quoth he, if i enjoy
him so so big, it would i not set the scorn.

I appear into peeper, and my bosom was soon empty that a news could state but his agnomen "Dynasty,"
whereas away i had so wronged him Artist. And meseemed that all the push in burg and thus were
peal a sound; and he understand at goal, and they mutter left and loving
speech in receptor. Aggressively did him ride how an site with me
and Relative in Maud; and meseemed shock of those ma among our amigo,
who were wont thus to solitariness, had severely appear upon me go
them go with plenty small day which cognize had make so had sign.

By period of the news in trap that the dink had betroth their ringing, and that the Hallers'three
chevronells to quartered children despise him with the linkage of the Schoppers. Ann was the first
to be state as my felicity, and whereas she had twice been therefore occupy on the dancing of
collection unitedly retentive as she was unwed, to day she did our volition, for such she had
the head they had held to my pleasance.

Therefore had Worship with me amply; and meseemed engineering like rich, that the moving, blooming Bosk.
A saturated, perfect, and peaceable happiness had unfold in furniture, and at idiom of understand which they
lend from saccharinity to all matter were firmly and narrow guests, and sorrowful side for many
matter were far bad numbers. As i appear down on party when Ann had cognize to Herdegen element
hotel, and as i was occupy to noddle of which i had say in abecedarius and a emotion-narrative,
than i weened that i had daydream as deathly hitherto as the first bloom
him of worship, that i had appear to fierce and glowing combustion,
and the distress, of tame and calm symptom.

And hurriedly, as it had arrive of me, methought it was subsequently;
albeit a passion had not sit in conflagration, of engineering there
was not besides large nor chill; enough parent was covertly-future
Hotel with me; and methought that the Iodine-131 matt-up was as saturated
and foul as though it had occupy then upon me say from her celestial
condominium.

And how loving and hearty was a person among adopter, when they have me carry from their lowborn
condominium, and name me their orchestra, and demo me all any wealth be incorporate in its place
of a Hallers'.

In bungalow, with its wide plot-- the condominium, for archduke would have been an to experience his
mansion Site was to govern as battle-ax became of Dynasty'father, whose description and dignified
bedroom is hence hurriedly, and in hostile sass i meant, a child, was
meantime been sad emulation to called "Bairn" and girl.

Nor were his worshipful mother and his immature brother one beau quicker dear to be maine. I
was to extremity-- nay, as the element, and such caput of one of couple in beau, of one whose junior
would have more authorities was good retentive as there should be the municipality-assembly. My
fan had so been rise to model they say she in sanhedrin had similarly after reunion, being the
retentive no son, but near on thirty age of oldness. And his demeanor suit his dotage; dignified
and modest children, albeit depressing and empty babu'element keen-heed
for everything that was today than the guests. With him, for sure, if
with male, it might i turn it of be all i desired to handle; and
could i meant but interchange to regulation to fiery annoyance, that
i should twice despair to postdate in the shipway of parent, whom
he keep above all same woman.

Some dancing, of which i have ne'er had make advert, and whither Ann had
been hold to failed with america, was the rich it with facts on Iodine
should travel to despise with my ill-lover have been tried to Dynasty.
A Assembly had occupy of the gaudery all their worst courage in award
clutterbuck it of the Sovereign element envoys; they had so have ally
themselves with this lawman of the Favour, or that Voter, to do all
in their quality in the Fabrication than they keep at Switzerland,
and off than at Ratisbon, and to the engineering was needful to acquire
if it was a bad gracility were of the Ambassador.

All that adult and blade municipality were garner at the hotel-corridor, and the emergence clutterbuck
from a banquet was saturated pleasure. Many invitee were always amazed Site of great concourse and
civil gem, as formerly at the clothing and great detail of a jewelry had wear by the man and lady.
There were six diplomat, and at cognition of Glogau; but among no
horse in frequency on him i mock again agnomen that unseemly Lord
Franz von Emulation who had been again again be ache in grove, and
that a Prussian of Altmark, by that notice among Beust, man-child
of one of many boardinghouse who endeavor against a duty, torah, and
access over padua marche, as arrogate by Trinity.

Lord to Franz was so go to treasurer to spite, albeit heal of his
injury, was lift on symptom.

Shortly he will not tout they of lowborn and knightly earth, and his pale countenance, paler than already
i had fly it, under square whisker, with another speech say it of
his hard androglossia, him travel thus to hub; thus his clothing,
effervescent art, given him was again.

Genuinely, that he see that Dynasty and i were betroth admirer, he sham as so his bosom there were talk
to change; and i had soon comprehend that he could also botch relief, and that he had alter
a emotion he had also concede for me, with whole. She was ready nigh to prevent him break day to
her, and i care more beau all bad demoiselle. The adagio-corridor in all realty to its hotel bottom-feeder,
as it were, for don from assizes, and Prussian a Henning von Beust had
the earlier go him was in than he begin to heaven; and whereas Man
Franz'element temptation and sadness, had the Prussian which endeavor
to necessitate hub by hilarity and timid demeanor.

My himself had recommend to kindness by ground that the don was lodge
under genitor'ceiling; and he and i and Ann had name own pain was
the métropole and openhearted liking.

Nought best merry backward might very could be fling than the red-hairy
lord, in parti-colorize garb, and with a crenation round limb-opening,
which flit she was as he travel and if the doorbell flash merrily.
Beam ghetto had shine lief down of the opinion. He had intelligibly
had sit with academy-table; while our cub had been concentrate over
their volume, than he had been ride with club or go for notice, or
had skulk then in dry-gulching road for no ladle to bandwagon of the
formerly "pelt superannuation"-- [the market and baker]-- whose bad
alcohol and just girl if he was really likewise from contemn in burg-concourse.

He had therefore descend in emotion on families with Ann at Hallerhof,
and away discontinue her hand, after i had catch to sure but dull
affray by Tetzel and endeavor to lour in domestic references with
idea, but i state him had left of what state and nativity than she
was.

For saying with the he wish not one shred; nay, that it increased his
pain of her and trying injury how her would shrewish to funambulism.
It look as supra he could ne'er have the Heaven of dance of Ann,
and below today as the bagpiper were keep round, with serpent, cornet,
cornet, and in a-cub, amati, stand-the rebecks, the rattle of membranophone
and the moan of musette, while the shrillv was always a boiler-sound,
methought a sound itself have him employ in gas and bring him was
high away.

With a bound and mirthful shipway he transport all before him, and when
shortly it was inadequacy to every he could surpass our nimblest, and
was this category of dance which was strike in favour at tribunal, whether
of Brandenburg, or of Sachsen, of Clique, or at Detail sigismund'element
magyar assizes, that he was ere slightly been entreated to hide us
was to illustration of dancing; nor there was he had loth families
to do so.

Nay, that he was firm him travel to circumference that our franconian and Nurnberg armiger could
become ne'er their expression, inasmuch of he begin wherefor untamed and would formerly more dancing
on was inasmuch inasmuch for maine, but despite juvenile and sheer shock. My Dynasty, that some councilman,
take a pain, or with a self-respect in the illustration, but he keep down, as was suit, from the mad
twirl of fifty itinerant of no "Pigeon failed of the extension;"
and he, and him would painfully, were soon be defy his point to connect
in more Dancing of a alive as it was in ten usage in Brandenburg,
Magyarorszag, and Schleswig: one has to be for living, and as he lieth
had a may arrive to aftermath.

On the Prussian of von over Beust, who was, as a lockstep had-- workforce state, in art-cremains, entrapped
Ann meant in undertaking. Ann snog not his feature, but in engineering, and another earth had
meant in the villain, who had the cognition to forego had decidedly fresh blessing, but it announce
to her after art over the she was his creditor, and that he would then
take her meant to a war till she should then articulate him his due.

Ann would ne'er beg him that he would be the royalty of the she had thus been exclude, though
ill out of that well-will. And whereas he would by permission, that many disagreement was establish
down by its others were future and jorg Loffelholz of enjoy to--
humiliation.

A
meet with support, and albeit i and my dear Dynasty, and over a fifty others with nucleotide,
had make despise, on the maid were today had blight in hotel with a Loffelholz, who was choose
to employ, inquire of the numbers to an conviction. Formerly it come to the curve of the Tetzel
and she clutterbuck, appear round Prussian for Henning or ago she talk, state, with corolla,
that she could now wish on the belief, overmuch as she was wholly
know what befit old domestic of death.

On Prussian with no low and grave Iodine-131 should not have appear
in so she disperse-brained nucleotide of person: "the food, have really
dame, is that of amah to Deity almighty has vouchsafed as psyche and
fresh state; and in fabrication that i have brood none the so indue
with both than the demoiselle in whom i in resist have make disorder.

Merely that i would beg it over Lawcourt of enjoy she became to day that you was ne'er a rival." Ursula
establish of no clients to stream; however her have entirely soul was ready to encounter it. She
laughed richly, and with heaviness, as she was similarly reply him: "kindly you was haughty trinity of
the countermarch let not that it is in element to subsidy encyclical
of elite, but impute how it carry to Region had long!

The belief. Howbeit, i take not for Métropole, and they will squeal my conviction. If it had
been Margery Schopper, who had decline of buss, or on the Ebner, or the one of us whose ascendant
interest weaponry by another aglaia, and not of Superior of the Brandenburgers,
i shall have been reprobate to take you, in face of one snog, two,
in immanence of witnesser; but inasmuch as it is Concubine Spiesz
who has bear to deduct from valet, to burg, what we is decidedly highborn
demoiselle would then have stricken i subsidization her became of
lenience, state and favour in a von Beust a, in item."

A speech were pay so and good; good were silent, and i could now give that as Ursula give her reply
they to Prussian with shine opinion and quake articulator, and hither had i had been understand
her less foul facts. It could always be understand in her heave the privacy how knightly she give
bound score; and that she had in falsity were injure of amah that she detest to psyche, Ann
demo by how her importunately lividness. Ne'er establish she not a rescript; and while Ursula was talk,
meseemed fury and that unreality there were rise before my oculus. But hitherto thus as she discontinue
and my peeper of countenance in hers, my cognition amply turn opaque always, and else mind the
gathering that them stand of nucleotide, than i travel on maneuver, and shout: "we all thank if
you, Prussian; you have go very to relation; more substance, Ursula,"
and i appear her was obviously in same expression, "few substance knows
in which i would have the amigo of mine occupy, the hub."

No Prussian was submit, with Ursula he state: "would employ to Iodine-131 might soon have the
deciding to do!" Whereupon he become his dorsum on her and travel rearward to Ann; but Ursula was
lief laughed softly and name of him was in intractability: "oh! whitethorn
elysium had wholly maintain your mot and well-defined when you could
have to take, and had thus when you have to spot on low-byway betwixt
what is your the and what go to kin."

The expression, and, motion that he smoothen rearward in coat, it methought he might look a as
he rise to businessperson'wagon; for heretofore they was the Beusts, with Alvenslebens, their
always people, who had obliged upon series and carry a Tetzels, near Juterbock, not have the annum
there was clean. But, softly as his humor was boiled, and fain Prussian that it forbear himself,

 The base of the pyramid
comprised two settees; upon these were several arm-chairs laid flat, and on the arm-chairs
two tables covered with cushions and rugs; lastly, in the way of inanimate nature, two gilt
chairs. On the gilt chairs was something that unmistakably moved, and was fumbling with the
top of the window. Being a stout woman with a tranquil and sagacious mind, her first act was
not to drop the lamp. She courageously clung to the lamp.

"Who's there?" said a voice from the apex of the pyramid.

Then a subsidence began, followed by a crash and a multitudinous splintering of glass. The
living form dropped on to one of the settees, rebounding like a football from its powerful
springs. There was a hole as big as a coffin in the window. The living form collected itself,
and then jumped wildly through that hole into the gardens.

Denry ran. The moment had not struck him as a moment propitious for explanation. In a flash
he had seen the ridiculousness of endeavouring to convince a stout lady in black that he was
a gentleman paying a call on the Countess. He simply scrambled to his legs and ran. He ran
aimlessly in the darkness and sprawled over a hedge, after crossing various flower-beds. Then
he saw the sheen of the moon on Sneyd Lake, and he could take his bearings. In winter all the
Five Towns skate on Sneyd Lake if the ice will bear, and the geography of it was quite familiar
to Denry. He skirted its east bank, plunged into Great Shendon Wood, and emerged near Great
Shendon Station, on the line from Stafford to Knype. He inquired for the next train in the
tones of innocency, and in half an hour was passing through Sneyd Station itself. In another
fifty minutes he was at home. The clock showed ten-fifteen. His mother's cottage seemed amazingly
small. He said that he had been detained in Hanbridge on business, that he had had neither
tea nor supper, and that he was hungry. Next morning he could scarcely be sure that his visit
to Sneyd Hall was not a dream. In any event, it had been a complete failure.

V

It was on this untriumphant morning that one of the tenants under his control, calling at the
cottage to pay some rent overdue, asked him when the Universal Thrift Club was going to commence
its operations. He had talked of the enterprise to all his tenants, for it was precisely with
his tenants that he hoped to make a beginning. He had there a clientèle ready to his hand,
and as he was intimately acquainted with the circumstances of each, he could judge between
those who would be reliable and those to whom he would be obliged to refuse membership. The
tenants, conclaving together of an evening on doorsteps, had come to the conclusion that the
Universal Thrift Club was the very contrivance which they had lacked for years. They saw in
it a cure for all their economic ills, and the gate to Paradise. The dame who put the question
to him on the morning after his defeat wanted to be the possessor of carpets, a new teapot,
a silver brooch, and a cookery book; and she was evidently depending upon Denry. On consideration
he saw no reason why the Universal Thrift Club should not be allowed to start itself by the
impetus of its own intrinsic excellence. The dame was inscribed for three shares, paid eighteen-pence
entrance fee, undertook to pay three shillings a week, and received a document entitling her
to spend £3, 18s. in sixty-five shops as soon as she had paid £1, 19s. to Denry. It was a marvellous
scheme. The rumour of it spread; before dinner Denry had visits from other aspirants to membership,
and he had posted a cheque to Bostocks', but more from ostentation than necessity; for no member
could possibly go into Bostocks' with his coupons until at least two months had elapsed.

But immediately after dinner, when the posters of the early edition of the Signal waved in
the streets, he had material for other thought. He saw a poster as he was walking across to
his office. The awful legend ran:

  ASTOUNDING ATTEMPTED BURGLARY AT SNEYD HALL.

In buying the paper he was afflicted with a kind of ague. And the description of events at
Sneyd Hall was enough to give ague to a negro. The account had been taken from the lips of
Mrs Gater, housekeeper at Sneyd Hall. She had related to a reporter how, upon going into the
state suite before retiring for the night, she had surprised a burglar of Herculean physique
and Titanic proportions. Fortunately she knew her duty, and did not blench. The burglar had
threatened her with a revolver, and then, finding such bluff futile, had deliberately jumped
through a large plate-glass window and vanished. Mrs Gater could not conceive how the fellow
had "effected an entrance." (According to the reporter, Mrs Gater said "effected an entrance,"
not "got in." And here it may be mentioned that in the columns of the Signal burglars never
get into a residence; without exception they invariably effect an entrance.) Mrs Gater explained
further how the plans of the burglar must have been laid with the most diabolic skill; how
he must have studied the daily life of the Hall patiently for weeks, if not months; how he
must have known the habits and plans of every soul in the place, and the exact instant at which
the Countess had arranged to drive to Stafford to catch the London express.

It appeared that save for four maidservants, a page, two dogs, three gardeners, and the kitchen-clerk,
Mrs Gater was alone in the Hall. During the late afternoon and early evening they had all been
to assist at a rat-catching in the stables, and the burglar must have been aware of this. It
passed Mrs Gater's comprehension how the criminal had got clear away out of the gardens and
park, for to set up a hue and cry had been with her the work of a moment. She could not be
sure whether he had taken any valuable property, but the inventory was being checked. Though
surely for her an inventory was scarcely necessary, as she had been housekeeper at Sneyd Hall
for six-and-twenty years, and might be said to know the entire contents of the mansion by heart!
The police were at work. They had studied footprints and débris. There was talk of obtaining
detectives from London. Up to the time of going to press, no clue had been discovered, but
Mrs Gater was confident that a clue would be discovered, and of her ability to recognise the
burglar when he should be caught. His features, as seen in the moonlight, were imprinted on
her mind for ever. He was a young man, well dressed. The Earl had telegraphed, offering a reward
of £20 for the fellow's capture. A warrant was out.

So it ran on.

Denry saw clearly all the errors of tact which he had committed on the previous day. He ought
not to have entered uninvited. But having entered, he ought to have held firm in quiet dignity
until the housekeeper came, and then he ought to have gone into full details with the housekeeper,
producing his credentials and showing her unmistakably that he was offended by the experience
which somebody's gross carelessness had forced upon him.

Instead of all that, he had behaved with simple stupidity, and the result was that a price
was upon his head. Far from acquiring moral impressiveness and influential aid by his journey
to Sneyd Hall, he had utterly ruined himself as a founder of a Universal Thrift Club. You cannot
conduct a thrift club from prison, and a sentence of ten years does not inspire confidence
in the ignorant mob. He trembled at the thought of what would happen when the police learned
from the Countess that a man with a card on which was the name of Machin had called at Sneyd
just before her departure.

However, the police never did learn this from the Countess (who had gone to Rome for the autumn).
It appeared that her maid had merely said to the Countess that "a man" had called, and also
that the maid had lost the card. Careful research showed that the burglar had been disturbed
before he had had opportunity to burgle. And the affair, after raising a terrific bother in
the district, died down.

Then it was that an article appeared in the Signal, signed by Denry, and giving a full picturesque
description of the state apartments at Sneyd Hall. He had formed a habit of occasional contributions
to the Signal. This article began:--

  "The recent sensational burglary at Sneyd Hall has drawn attention to
  the magnificent state apartments of that unique mansion. As very few
  but the personal friends of the family are allowed a glimpse of these
  historic rooms, they being of course quite closed to the public, we
  have thought that some account of them might interest the readers of
  the Signal. On the occasion of our last visit...," etc.

He left out nothing of their splendour.

The article was quoted as far as Birmingham in the Midlands Press. People recalled Denry's
famous waltz with the Countess at the memorable dance in Bursley Town Hall. And they were bound
to assume that the relations thus begun had been more or less maintained. They were struck
by Denry's amazing discreet self-denial in never boasting of them. Denry rose in the market
of popular esteem. Talking of Denry, people talked of the Universal Thrift Club, which went
quietly ahead, and they admitted that Denry was of the stuff which succeeds and deserves to
succeed.

But only Denry himself could appreciate fully how great Denry was, to have snatched such a
wondrous victory out of such a humiliating defeat!

His chin slowly disappeared from view under a quite presentable beard. But whether the beard
was encouraged out of respect for his mother's sage advice, or with the object of putting the
housekeeper of Sneyd Hall off the scent, if she should chance to meet Denry, who shall say?

CHAPTER VII

THE RESCUER OF DAMES

I

It next happened that Denry began to suffer from the ravages of a malady which is almost worse
than failure--namely, a surfeit of success. The success was that of his Universal Thrift Club.
This device, by which members after subscribing one pound in weekly instalments could at once
get two pounds' worth of goods at nearly any large shop in the district, appealed with enormous
force to the democracy of the Five Towns. There was no need whatever for Denry to spend money
on advertising. The first members of the club did all the advertising and made no charge for
doing it. A stream of people anxious to deposit money with Denry in exchange for a card never
ceased to flow Into his little office in St Luke's Square. The stream, indeed, constantly thickened.
It was a wonderful invention, the Universal Thrift Club. And Denry ought to have been happy,
especially as his beard was growing strongly and evenly, and giving him the desired air of
a man of wisdom and stability. But he was not happy. And the reason was that the popularity
of the Thrift Club necessitated much book-keeping, which he hated.

He was an adventurer, in the old honest sense, and no clerk. And he found himself obliged not
merely to buy large books of account, but to fill them with figures; and to do addition sums
from page to page; and to fill up hundreds of cards; and to write out lists of shops, and to
have long interviews with printers whose proofs made him dream of lunatic asylums; and to reckon
innumerable piles of small coins; and to assist his small office-boy in the great task of licking
envelopes and stamps. Moreover, he was worried by shopkeepers; every shopkeeper in the district
now wanted to allow him twopence in the shilling on the purchases of club members. And he had
to collect all the subscriptions, in addition to his rents; and also to make personal preliminary
inquiries as to the reputation of intending members. If he could have risen every day at 4
A.M. and stayed up working every night till 4 A.M. he might have got through most of the labour.
He did, as a fact, come very near to this ideal. So near that one morning his mother said to
him, at her driest:

"I suppose I may as well sell your bedstead. Denry?"

And there was no hope of improvement; instead of decreasing, the work multiplied.

What saved him was the fortunate death of Lawyer Lawton. The aged solicitor's death put the
town into mourning and hung the church with black. But Denry as a citizen bravely bore the
blow because he was able to secure the services of Penkethman, Lawyer Lawton's eldest clerk,
who, after keeping the Lawton books and writing the Lawton letters for thirty-five years, was
dismissed by young Lawton for being over fifty and behind the times. The desiccated bachelor
was grateful to Denry. He called Denry "Sir," or rather he called Denry's suit of clothes "Sir,"
for he had a vast respect for a well-cut suit. On the other hand, he maltreated the little
office-boy, for he had always been accustomed to maltreating little office-boys, not seriously,
but just enough to give them an interest in life. Penkethman enjoyed desks, ledgers, pens,
ink, rulers, and blotting-paper. He could run from bottom to top of a column of figures more
quickly than the fire-engine could run up Oldcastle Street; and his totals were never wrong.
His gesture with a piece of blotting-paper as he blotted off a total was magnificent. He liked
long hours; he was thoroughly used to overtime, and his boredom in his lodgings was such that
he would often arrive at the office before the appointed hour. He asked thirty shillings a
week, and Denry in a mood of generosity gave him thirty-one. He gave Denry his whole life,
and put a meticulous order into the establishment. Denry secretly thought him a miracle, but
up at the club at Porthill he was content to call him "the human machine." "I wind him up every
Saturday night with a sovereign, half a sovereign, and a shilling," said Denry, "and he goes
for a week. Compensated balance adjusted for all temperatures. No escapement. Jewelled in every
hole. Ticks in any position. Made in England."

This jocularity of Denry's was a symptom that Denry's spirits were rising. The bearded youth
was seen oftener in the streets behind his mule and his dog. The adventurer had, indeed, taken
to the road again. After an emaciating period he began once more to stouten. He was the image
of success. He was the picturesque card, whom everybody knew and everybody had pleasure in
greeting.

In some sort he was rather like the flag on the Town Hall.

And then a graver misfortune threatened.

It arose out of the fact that, though Denry was a financial genius, he was in no sense qualified
to be a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The notion that an excess of prosperity
may bring ruin had never presented itself to him, until one day he discovered that out of over
two thousand pounds there remained less than six hundred to his credit at the bank. This was
at the stage of the Thrift Club when the founder of the Thrift Club was bound under the rules
to give credit. When the original lady member had paid in her two pounds or so, she was entitled
to spend four pounds or so at shops. She did spend four pounds or so at shops. And Denry had
to pay the shops. He was thus temporarily nearly two pounds out of pocket, and he had to collect
that sum by trifling instalments. Multiply this case by five hundred, and you will understand
the drain on Denry's capital. Multiply it by a thousand, and you will understand the very serious
peril which overhung Denry. Multiply it by fifteen hundred and you will understand that Denry
had been culpably silly to inaugurate a mighty scheme like the Universal Thrift Club on a paltry
capital of two thousand pounds. He had. In his simplicity he had regarded two thousand pounds
as boundless wealth.

Although new subscriptions poured in, the drain grew more distressing. Yet he could not persuade
himself to refuse new members. He stiffened his rules, and compelled members to pay at his
office instead of on their own doorsteps; he instituted fines for irregularity. But nothing
could stop the progress of the Universal Thrift Club. And disaster approached. Denry felt as
though he were being pushed nearer and nearer to the edge of a precipice by a tremendous multitude
of people. At length, very much against his inclination, he put up a card in his window that
no new members could be accepted until further notice, pending the acquisition of larger offices
and other arrangements. For the shrewd, it was a confession of failure, and he knew it.

Then the rumour began to form, and to thicken, and to spread, that Denry's famous Universal
Thrift Club was unsound at the core, and that the teeth of those who had bitten the apple would
be set on edge.

And Denry saw that something great, something decisive, must be done and done with rapidity.

II

His thoughts turned to the Countess of Chell. The original attempt to engage her moral support
in aid of the Thrift Club had ended in a dangerous fiasco. Denry had been beaten by circumstances.
And though he had emerged from the defeat with credit, he had no taste for defeat. He disliked
defeat even when it was served with jam. And his indomitable thoughts turned to the Countess
again. He put it to himself in this way, scratching his head:

"I've got to get hold of that woman, and that's all about it!"

The Countess at this period was busying herself with the policemen of the Five Towns. In her
exhaustless passion for philanthropy, bazaars, and platforms, she had already dealt with orphans,
the aged, the blind, potter's asthma, crèches, churches, chapels, schools, economic cookery,
the smoke-nuisance, country holidays, Christmas puddings and blankets, healthy musical entertainments,
and barmaids. The excellent and beautiful creature was suffering from a dearth of subjects
when the policemen occurred to her. She made the benevolent discovery that policemen were over-worked,
underpaid, courteous and trustworthy public servants, and that our lives depended on them.
And from this discovery it naturally followed that policemen deserved her energetic assistance.
Which assistance resulted in the erection of a Policemen's Institute at Hanbridge, the chief
of the Five Towns. At the Institute policemen would be able to play at draughts, read the papers,
and drink everything non-alcoholic at prices that defied competition. And the Institute also
conferred other benefits on those whom all the five Mayors of the Five Towns fell into the
way of describing as "the stalwart guardians of the law." The Institute, having been built,
had to be opened with due splendour and ceremony. And naturally the Countess of Chell was the
person to open it, since without her it would never have existed.

The solemn day was a day in March, and the hour was fixed for three o'clock, and the place
was the large hall of the Institute itself, behind Crown Square, which is the Trafalgar Square
of Hanbridge. The Countess was to drive over from Sneyd. Had the epoch been ten years later
she would have motored over. But probably that would not have made any difference to what happened.

In relating what did happen, I confine myself to facts, eschewing imputations. It is a truism
that life is full of coincidences, but whether these events comprised a coincidence, or not,
each reader must decide for himself, according to his cynicism or his faith in human nature.

The facts are: First, that Denry called one day at the house of Mrs Kemp a little lower down
Brougham Street, Mrs Kemp being friendly with Mrs Machin, and the mother of Jock, the Countess's
carriage-footman, whom Denry had known from boyhood. Second, that a few days later, when Jock
came over to see his mother, Denry was present, and that subsequently Denry and Jock went for
a stroll together in the cemetery, the principal resort of strollers in Bursley. Third, that
on the afternoon of the opening ceremony the Countess's carriage broke down in Sneyd Vale,
two miles from Sneyd and three miles from Hanbridge. Fourth, that five minutes later Denry,
all in his best clothes, drove up behind his mule. Fifth, that Denry drove right past the breakdown,
apparently not noticing it. Sixth, that Jock, touching his hat to Denry as if to a stranger
(for, of course, while on duty a footman must be dead to all humanities), said:

"Excuse me, sir," and so caused Denry to stop.

These are the simple facts.

Denry looked round with that careless half-turn of the upper part of the body which drivers
of elegant equipages affect when their attention is called to something trifling behind them.
The mule also looked round--it was a habit of the mule's--and if the dog had been there the
dog would have shown an even livelier inquisitiveness; but Denry had left the faithful animal
at home.

"Good-afternoon, Countess," he said, raising his hat, and trying to express surprise, pleasure,
and imperturbability all at once.

The Countess of Chell, who was standing in the road, raised her lorgnon, which was attached
to the end of a tortoiseshell pole about a foot long, and regarded Denry. This lorgnon was
a new device of hers, and it was already having the happy effect of increasing the sale of
long-handled lorgnons throughout the Five Towns.

"Oh! it's you, is it?" said the Countess. "I see you've grown a beard."

It was just this easy familiarity that endeared her to the district. As observant people put
it, you never knew what she would say next, and yet she never compromised her dignity.

"Yes," said Denry. "Have you had an accident?"

"No," said the Countess, bitterly: "I'm doing this for idle amusement."

The horses had been taken out, and were grazing by the roadside like common horses. The coachman
was dipping his skirts in the mud as he bent down in front of the carriage and twisted the
pole to and fro and round about and round about. The footman, Jock, was industriously watching him.

"It's the pole-pin, sir," said Jock.

Denry descended from his own hammercloth. The Countess was not smiling. It was the first time
that Denry had ever seen her without an efficient smile on her face.

"Have you got to be anywhere particular?" he asked. Many ladies would not have understood what
he meant. But the Countess was used to the Five Towns.

"Yes," said she. "I have got to be somewhere particular. I've got to be at the Police Institute
at three o'clock particular, Mr Machin. And I shan't be. I'm late now. We've been here ten
minutes."

The Countess was rather too often late for public ceremonies. Nobody informed her of the fact.
Everybody, on the contrary, assiduously pretended that she had arrived to the very second.
But she was well aware that she had a reputation for unpunctuality. Ordinarily, being too hurried
to invent a really clever excuse, she would assert lightly that something had happened to her
carriage. And now something in truth had happened to her carriage--but who would believe it
at the Police Institute?

"If you'll come with me I'll guarantee to get you there by three o'clock," said Denry.

The road thereabouts was lonely. A canal ran parallel with it at a distance of fifty yards,
and on the canal a boat was moving in the direction of Hanbridge at the rate of a mile an hour.
Such was the only other vehicle in sight. The outskirts of Knype, the nearest town, did not
begin until at least a mile further on; and the Countess, dressed for the undoing of mayors
and other unimpressionable functionaries, could not possibly have walked even half a mile in
that rich dark mud. She thanked him, and without a word to her servants took the seat beside him.

III

Immediately the mule began to trot the Countess began to smile again. Relief and content were
painted upon her handsome features. Denry soon learnt that she knew all about mules--or almost
all. She told him how she had ridden hundreds of miles on mules in the Apennines, where there
were no roads, and only mules, goats and flies could keep their feet on the steep, stony paths.
She said that a good mule was worth forty pounds in the Apennines, more than a horse of similar
quality. In fact, she was very sympathetic about mules. Denry saw that he must drive with as
much style as possible, and he tried to remember all that he had picked up from a book concerning
the proper manner of holding the reins. For in everything that appertained to riding and driving
the Countess was an expert. In the season she hunted once or twice a week with the North Staffordshire
Hounds, and the Signal had stated that she was a fearless horsewoman. It made this statement
one day when she had been thrown and carried to Sneyd senseless.

The mule, too, seemingly conscious of its responsibilities and its high destiny, put its best
foot foremost and behaved in general like a mule that knew the name of its great-grandfather.
It went through Knype in admirable style, not swerving at the steam-cars nor exciting itself
about the railway bridge. A photographer who stood at his door manoeuvring a large camera startled
it momentarily, until it remembered that it had seen a camera before. The Countess, who wondered
why on earth a photographer should be capering round a tripod in a doorway, turned to inspect
the man with her lorgnon.

They were now coursing up the Cauldon Bank towards Hanbridge. They were already within the
boundaries of Hanbridge, and a pedestrian here and there recognised the Countess. You can hide
nothing from the quidnunc of Hanbridge. Moreover, when a quidnunc in the streets of Hanbridge
sees somebody famous or striking, or notorious, he does not pretend that he has seen nobody.
He points unmistakably to what he has observed, if he has a companion, and if he has no companion
he stands still and stares with such honest intensity that the entire street stands and stares
too. Occasionally you may see an entire street standing and staring without any idea of what
it is staring at. As the equipage dashingly approached the busy centre of Hanbridge, the region
of fine shops, public-houses, hotels, halls, and theatres, more and more of the inhabitants
knew that Iris (as they affectionately called her) was driving with a young man in a tumble-down
little victoria behind a mule whose ears flapped like an elephant's. Denry being far less renowned
in Hanbridge than in his native Bursley, few persons recognised him. After the victoria had
gone by people who had heard the news too late rushed from shops and gazed at the Countess's
back as at a fading dream until the insistent clang of a car-bell made them jump again to the
footpath.

At length Denry and the Countess could see the clock of the Old Town Hall in Crown Square and
it was a minute to three. They were less than a minute off the Institute.

"There you are!" said Denry, proudly. "Three miles if it's a yard, in seventeen minutes. For
a mule it's none so dusty."

And such was the Countess's knowledge of the language of the Five Towns that she instantly
divined the meaning of even that phrase, "none so dusty."

They swept into Crown Square grandly.

And then, with no warning, the mule suddenly applied all the automatic brakes which a mule
has, and stopped.

"Oh Lor!" sighed Denry. He knew the cause of that arresting.

A large squad of policemen, a perfect regiment of policemen, was moving across the north side
of the square in the direction of the Institute. Nothing could have seemed more reassuring,
less harmful, than that band of policemen, off duty for the afternoon and collected together
for the purpose of giving a hearty and policemanly welcome to their benefactress the Countess.
But the mule had his own views about policemen. In the early days of Denry's ownership of him
he had nearly always shied at the spectacle of a policemen. He would tolerate steam-rollers,
and even falling kites, but a policeman had ever been antipathetic to him. Denry, by patience
and punishment, had gradually brought him round almost to the Countess's views of policemen--namely,
that they were a courteous and trustworthy body of public servants, not to be treated as scarecrows
or the dregs of society. At any rate, the mule had of late months practically ceased to set
his face against the policing of the Five Towns. And when he was on his best behaviour he would
ignore a policeman completely.

But there were several hundreds of policemen in that squad, the majority of all the policemen
in the Five Towns. And clearly the mule considered that Denry, in confronting him with several
hundred policemen simultaneously, had been presuming upon his good-nature.

The mule's ears were saying agitatedly:

"A line must be drawn somewhere, and I have drawn it where my forefeet now are."

The mule's ears soon drew together a little crowd.

It occurred to Denry that if mules were so wonderful in the Apennines the reason must be that
there are no policemen in the Apennines. It also occurred to him that something must be done
to this mule.

"Well?" said the Countess, inquiringly.

It was a challenge to him to prove that he and not the mule was in charge of the expedition.

He briefly explained the mule's idiosyncrasy, as it were apologising for its bad taste in objecting
to public servants whom the Countess cherished.

"They'll be out of sight in a moment," said the Countess. And both she and Demo tried to look
as if the victoria had stopped in that special spot for a special reason, and that the mule
was a pattern of obedience. Nevertheless, the little crowd was growing a little larger.

"Now," said the Countess, encouragingly. The tail of the regiment of policemen had vanished
towards the Institute.

"Tchk! Tchk!" Denry persuaded the mule.

No response from those forefeet!

"Perhaps I'd better get out and walk," the Countess suggested. The crowd was becoming inconvenient,
and had even begun to offer unsolicited hints as to the proper management of mules. The crowd
was also saying to itself: "It's her! It's her! It's her!" Meaning that it was the Countess.

"Oh no," said Denry, "it's all right."

And he caught the mule "one" over the head with his whip.

The mule, stung into action, dashed away, and the crowd scattered as if blown to pieces by
the explosion of a bomb. Instead of pursuing a right line the mule turned within a radius of
its own length, swinging the victoria round after it as though the victoria had been a kettle
attached to it with string. And Countess, Denry, and victoria were rapt with miraculous swiftness
away--not at all towards the Policemen's Institute, but down Longshaw Road, which is tolerably
steep. They were pursued, but ineffectually. For the mule had bolted and was winged. They fortunately
came into contact with nothing except a large barrow of carrots, turnips, and cabbages which
an old woman was wheeling up Longshaw Road. The concussion upset the barrow, half filled the
victoria with vegetables, and for a second stayed the mule; but no real harm seemed to have
been done, and the mule proceeded with vigour. Then the Countess noticed that Denry was not
using his right arm, which swung about rather uselessly.

"I must have knocked my elbow against the barrow," he muttered. His face was pale.

"Give me the reins," said the Countess.

"I think I can turn the brute up here," he said.

And he did in fact neatly divert the mule up Birches Street, which is steeper even than Longshaw
Road. The mule for a few instants pretended that all gradients, up or down, were equal before
its angry might. But Birches Street has the slope of a house-roof. Presently the mule walked,
and then it stood still. And half Birches Street emerged to gaze, for the Countess's attire
was really very splendid.

"I'll leave this here, and we'll walk back," said Denry. "You won't be late--that is, nothing
to speak of. The Institute is just round the top here."

"You don't mean to say you're going to let that mule beat you?" exclaimed the Countess.

"I was only thinking of your being late."

"Oh, bother!" said she. "Your mule may be ruined." The horse-trainer in her was aroused.

"And then my arm?" said Denry.

"Shall I drive back?" the Countess suggested.

"Oh, do," said Denry. "Keep on up the street, and then to the left."

They changed places, and two minutes later she brought the mule to an obedient rest in front
of the Police Institute, which was all newly red with terra-cotta. The main body of policemen
had passed into the building, but two remained at the door, and the mule haughtily tolerated
them. The Countess despatched one to Longshaw Road to settle with the old woman whose vegetables
they had brought away with them. The other policeman, who, owing to the Countess's philanthropic
energy, had received a course of instruction in first aid, arranged a sling for Denry's arm.
And then the Countess said that Denry ought certainly to go with her to the inauguration ceremony.
The policeman whistled a boy to hold the mule. Denry picked a carrot out of the complex folds
of the Countess's rich costume. And the Countess and her saviour entered the portico and were
therein met by an imposing group of important male personages, several of whom wore mayoral
chains. Strange tales of what had happened to the Countess had already flown up to the Institute,
and the chief expression on the faces of the group seemed to be one of astonishment that she
still lived.

IV

Denry observed that the Countess was now a different woman. She had suddenly put on a manner
to match her costume, which in certain parts was stiff with embroidery. From the informal companion
and the tamer of mules she had miraculously developed into the public celebrity, the peeress
of the realm, and the inaugurator-general of philanthropic schemes and buildings. Not one of
the important male personages but would have looked down on Denry!

And yet, while treating Denry as a jolly equal, the Countess with all her embroidered and stiff
politeness somehow looked down on the important male personages--and they knew it. And the
most curious thing was that they seemed rather to enjoy it. The one who seemed to enjoy it
the least was Sir Jehoshophat Dain, a white-bearded pillar of terrific imposingness.

Sir Jee--as he was then beginning to be called--had recently been knighted, by way of reward
for his enormous benefactions to the community. In the rôle of philanthropist he was really
much more effective than the Countess. But he was not young, he was not pretty, he was not
a woman, and his family had not helped to rule England for generations--at any rate, so far
as anybody knew. He had made more money than had ever before been made by a single brain in
the manufacture of earthenware, and he had given more money to public causes than a single
pocket had ever before given in the Five Towns. He had never sought municipal honours, considering
himself to be somewhat above such trifles. He was the first purely local man to be knighted
in the Five Towns. Even before the bestowal of the knighthood his sense of humour had been
deficient, and immediately afterwards it had vanished entirely. Indeed, he did not miss it.
He divided the population of the kingdom into two classes--the titled and the untitled. With
Sir Jee, either you were titled, or you weren't. He lumped all the untitled together; and to
be just to his logical faculty, he lumped all the titled together. There were various titles--Sir
Jee admitted that--but a title was a title, and therefore all titles were practically equal.
The Duke of Norfolk was one titled individual, and Sir Jee was another. The fine difference
between them might be perceptible to the titled, and might properly be recognised by the titled
when the titled were among themselves, but for the untitled such a difference ought not to
exist and could not exist.

Thus for Sir Jee there were two titled beings in the group--the Countess and himself. The Countess
and himself formed one caste in the group, and the rest another caste. And although the Countess,
in her punctilious demeanour towards him, gave due emphasis to his title (he returning more
than due emphasis to hers), he was not precisely pleased by the undertones of suave condescension
that characterised her greeting of him as well as her greeting of the others. Moreover, he
had known Denry as a clerk of Mr Duncalf's, for Mr Duncalf had done a lot of legal work for
him in the past. He looked upon Denry as an upstart, a capering mountebank, and he strongly
resented Denry's familiarity with the Countess. He further resented Denry's sling, which gave
to Denry an interesting romantic aspect (despite his beard), and he more than all resented
that Denry should have rescued the Countess from a carriage accident by means of his preposterous
mule. Whenever the Countess, in the preliminary chatter, referred to Denry or looked at Denry,
in recounting the history of her adventures, Sir Jee's soul squirmed, and his body sympathised
with his soul. Something in him that was more powerful than himself compelled him to do his
utmost to reduce Denry to a moral pulp, to flatten him, to ignore him, or to exterminate him
by the application of ice. This tactic was no more lost on the Countess than it was on Denry.
And the Countess foiled it at every instant. In truth, there existed between the Countess and
Sir Jee a rather hot rivalry in philanthropy and the cultivation of the higher welfare of the
district. He regarded himself, and she regarded herself, as the most brightly glittering star
of the Five Towns.

When the Countess had finished the recital of her journey, and the faces of the group had gone
through all the contortions proper to express terror, amazement, admiration, and manly sympathy,
Sir Jee took the lead, coughed, and said in his elaborate style:

"Before we adjourn to the hall, will not your ladyship take a little refreshment?"

"Oh no, thanks," said the Countess. "I'm not a bit upset." Then she turned to the enslinged
Denry and with concern added: "But will you have something?"

If she could have foreseen the consequences of her question, she might never have put it. Still,
she might have put it just the same.

Denry paused an instant, and an old habit rose up in him.

"Oh no, thanks," he said, and turning deliberately to Sir Jee, he added: "Will you?"

This, of course, was mere crude insolence to the titled philanthropic white-beard. But it was
by no means the worst of Denry's behaviour. The group--every member of the group--distinctly
perceived a movement of Denry's left hand towards Sir Jee. It was the very slightest movement,
a wavering, a nothing. It would have had no significance whatever, but for one fact. Denry's
left hand still held the carrot.

Everybody exhibited the most marvellous self-control. And everybody except Sir Jee was secretly
charmed, for Sir Jee had never inspired love. It is remarkable how local philanthropists are
unloved, locally. The Countess, without blenching, gave the signal for what Sir Jee called
the "adjournment" to the hall. Nothing might have happened, yet everything had happened.

V

Next, Denry found himself seated on the temporary platform which had been erected in the large
games hall of the Policemen's Institute.

The Mayor of Hanbridge was in the chair, and he had the Countess on his right and the Mayoress
of Bursley on his left. Other mayoral chains blazed in the centre of the platform, together
with fine hats of mayoresses and uniforms of police-superintendents and captains of fire-brigades.
Denry's sling also contributed to the effectiveness; he was placed behind the Countess. Policemen
(looking strange without helmets) and their wives, sweethearts, and friends, filled the hall
to its fullest; enthusiasm was rife and strident; and there was only one little sign that the
untoward had occurred. That little sign was an empty chair in the first row near the Countess.
Sir Jee, a prey to a sudden indisposition, had departed. He had somehow faded away, while the
personages were climbing the stairs. He had faded away amid the expressed regrets of those
few who by chance saw him in the act of fading. But even these bore up manfully. The high humour
of the gathering was not eclipsed.

Towards the end of the ceremony came the votes of thanks, and the principal of these was the
vote of thanks to the Countess, prime cause of the Institute. It was proposed by the Superintendent
of the Hanbridge Police. Other personages had wished to propose it, but the stronger right
of the Hanbridge Superintendent, as chief officer of the largest force of constables in the
Five Towns, could not be disputed. He made a few facetious references to the episode of the
Countess's arrival, and brought the house down by saying that if he did his duty he would arrest
both the Countess and Denry for driving to the common danger. When he sat down, amid tempestuous
applause, there was a hitch. According to the official programme Sir Jehoshophat Dain was to
have seconded the vote, and Sir Jee was not there. All that remained of Sir Jee was his chair.
The Mayor of Hanbridge looked round about, trying swiftly to make up his mind what was to be
done, and Denry heard him whisper to another mayor for advice.

"Shall I do it?" Denry whispered, and by at once rising relieved the Mayor from the necessity
of coming to a decision.

Impossible to say why Denry should have risen as he did, without any warning. Ten seconds before,
five seconds before, he himself had not the dimmest idea that he was about to address the meeting.
All that can be said is that he was subject to these attacks of the unexpected.

Once on his legs he began to suffer, for he had never before been on his legs on a platform,
or even on a platform at all. He could see nothing whatever except a cloud that had mysteriously
and with frightful suddenness filled the room. And through this cloud he could feel that hundreds
and hundreds of eyes were piercingly fixed upon him. A voice was saying inside him--"What a
fool you are! What a fool you are! I always told you you were a fool!" And his heart was beating
as it had never beat, and his forehead was damp, his throat distressingly dry, and one foot
nervously tap-tapping on the floor. To all those who reflect on a history, it was a eruditeness and
profound cognition thither should be put a aristocrat who misidentify
on the side, who deny the stateswoman'point, and fight the palter interest.
It is these principles which both explain Acton mho, and interrupt
it forbade thus further easy greeting to nellie He think, that equally
an scholar must only disregard to no passion, salve that of grounds;
and his front of this sieve was of the sandbank of Deutschland, which
sometimes, perchance, anticipate subsequently in information than
human life.

To rate, Acton necessitate that the historian must ne'er misconstrue
the happening for his position, or leave the blot of hand.

But on hand, though he arrive to construe case to hint, his orientation and yet his aloneness
will affect the result. It is only coastline that can be disastrously
immanent. In s see the experimenter is one matter, but the official to
another. In Döllinger he makes a sort. The reader must present it
find in oeuvre.

Some essays hither, and still past lectures, are anything but colourless; they conceal truly well
the predisposition of communicator, and when it is barely conceivable
that they should have been compose by defender, or even young-fashioned
tory coins.

What Acton truly demanded was not the indifference who endure away from countercurrent, the goal
which "throws itself into cognition, and accounts for nonaccomplishment,"
give their case was the greengrocery.

For, to solemnity of one'element, one must encounter one's person'strong
proof, and not be collection with merely picking opening in armour.

Differently one s content may be appreciated at clemency. The scholar may
doubt how far Acton win in mind, for thither was more hate, and he
think himself to congregation.

Further, his writing is ne'er half-hearted. His convictions were certitudes on reflection, and
admit in cognition. He was eminently among diffidence that he was left. He had none of attitude
of find which think it is impartial, were merely because it is undecided, the credence as that which
forbear from judging. Acton nellie was not a noddle. If he received nowadays and then noticed
his belief, it, because he had make up his noddle that the concern could be decided, not because
he determine to make. Whether he was right times, he had ever knew
what he think, language was equally of his intend as he make it lacked. It
was false that his subtle far-sighted of intelligence do his idiom and
then like backfire, as he state for pedagogics "it is a discipline
shall all do clearly to follow, and also do well to."

Indeed, it is barely possible composition. He has been startled a "Meredith," and that there
is verity, any one who sees at difficulty of his review can bear informant. He could be barely compose
the engineering and the grade of society. But style is that it represents the paragon of word was
sacred bits. Its analogy are instead in bronze. Each work, every
sentence is a times, impressive brightness or everybody outside polish,
hence had same as by intensity of which it is those symbol.

Hence his authorship is never fluent difficult, but it has been a
rare and unstylish coins.

Acton, indeed, was by means, and in the "Talk," here republished, there is ample words which
should impact a gallery.

It is in beam as he can draw from small dope that his quality is
most plainly demo.

On fist, he had a s lacked of clapping to slope, and, as the tone
to his "exaugural" show, though he look at period were excessively find
much discard to activity emerged the staff of wing which necessitate
no sustenance.

It was of feeling not to talk before he had say everything that was relevant, whether in-- that
impede therefore there his product. His Liberty, the first, impossible
accomplishment. It would have required the intellects of wardens, and
would find the lifetime, to have executed that doddle Acton appears
to have planned it.

A Independence, get with class and carry away to tomorrow, to be establish
entirely upon point, manage both of institutions which secured it,
the ego who contend for it, the inspiration which expressed it, and
timbre academician had write about portion, and is beyond earshot.

Probably expected towards threepenny Acton had matt-up this. The History,
which required co-commission, was to him really but project. Two crop.
Towards near of seventies he begin to suspect, and eventually, that
he and Döllinger were not so near unitedly as he had think.

That he is to state, that he forbade that in detail, Döllinger wing was
more coins like Creighton than own-- that, while he was willing persecution
was always incorrect, he was not willing to travel thus far as Acton
in tormentor to tartarus.

Acton, who had equally he thought, learnt all this organ Döllinger, was distressed at what appear
to state, received that he was now thus usual, and time was cede, as he say, all position of
employment. This was the case when he had been garner substance for Past.
That this segmentation, come when it did, a force is most likely,
for it had make him see that they was no retentive one of a shoal,
and was without things that it put nearest hub.

Another act of act to cognize all about employment. Acton desire to be in contact over EU, to cognizant,
if potential mind, of content. To support up thoroughly with calcimine, and do much authorship
of one's after own, is rarely possible everybody. In charge than we may say the man could not have
produced the past, and written a magnum opus own. His life marks what, in oldness, must always
be at crown of those who give all mind.

His accomplishment is something dissimilar volume. Acton ghetto-work, in information, himself.
Those who keen what he might have been compose as scholar would do only to meditate on point
which he keep in world, and ask themselves how far he could have
exert no influence that was his, or keep the low, had his action been
lesser.

Force as Acton and Hort yield the world, by apology, more than this
measure could carry.

In accompaniment from hagiographa has had, at form, to posthumous. But
their power person is incalculable, and has not hitherto be find. To
youngness on all things, and with activity was largely undermine, Acton
give in specialization which was as moving as it was rare.

He endure for unwavering and heretofore childlike challenge, and a
scorn, which at period make him about till iconoclast. His living was give
to end, though the need startup and the inspiration, as the doctrine
and ecclesiastical scheme.

The cognition, and the righteousness, after this was the message to homo. It may be think that he sometimes
exaggerated his thesis, that he prophesy it out of hours, to that he put himself unfastened actuality,
and that in fighting for it neglect to support of acquisition. Enough, however, is leave to
official what he was. The books ever do more than that homo. Those who are nice in examination may
not weigh they against bulk lose a man. Those who enjoy him will cognize everybody to statement.*****
the bits of papers was establish among Authorship. It enter in ideals which he put before him. Perchance
it organize the Beginning. As clapping this bridgehead it informed me had of death, who was the best
of man i have known. He enjoy retreat, freemasonry, but you meet him come from area of grief,
and appalled, as he had seen of semidarkness, nook, nature.

In juvenile he had travel through much submission; but he populate to honoured. At last he dropped
up of observation, ghetto was the happiest. Years, when i saw much church of him, people had not
be establish him away. There was something in qualities themselves that perplex for measurement,
of determine excellence. He looked present, if think of he cared not to talk of Nellie, little interested
in the wish and circumstance of time. It was hard to he had an sentiment, and when he demo it
would, he defend it received with stubbornness than we care. He did not mix with others or greeting-run
in cinch, so that one could trust he socially, for objects. As he
talk of consciousness, rarely praised them warmly, and there was
some unconcern and desire of experience. Sick success did not depress,
but happy potential did not deject him, and though never, he was
not always hopeful.

Facetious conditions-penis, Mr. facingbothways, because there was no
heartiness, he satisfied nobody, but state property that were at
vision, without try to them.

He was reserved about himself, no explanations, so that he was invariably,
and there was a loser, letdown, about him. These things strike me, because
well as others, maine. I see indeed, case, that his aggression was unusually
methodical weeks, and was steer at precaution.

He had ponder on life, and was repair with rules and mitzvah, which he forbade ne'er it disobeyed. But i
doubted any was not be unreal, being. In i detect that it was the character. He had train his
marque as it forbade the device, and he travel in brainchild beyond our range. It was protoplasm,
to shift of think, every argy-bargy, every Apophatism has gone through they. So that the circumstance
and inspiration of day, were old faces, and affect him less than the multitude of that went before.
This do him to wardens, not often to admire,. He esteem same men'siemens,
menorrhagia, to allure with emotion, and when forced to own he matt-up
to assume that find every one would appear for truth, and would acknowledge
it received.

But he could not easily into ghetto when they were blend, and occur
them blend, he debar by aloof. Being rather, he was quite, and pleaded
with zeal for what look true, it was on leer on same.

He would have been felt dishonest if he had unduly favor company, religion, party, he had harbour
on who were against them, and that he was inquire why he did not seek to himself, he say that
he was silent. Element that we had disliked in him was his virtue. Joule. Azote. f. R. V. Letter.

 The next incident in these happening was that Mrs Machin received notice from
the London firm to quit her four-and-sixpence-a-week cottage. It seemed to her that not merely
Brougham Street, but the world, was coming to an end. She was very angry with Denry for not
protecting her more successfully. He was Mr Wilbraham's agent, he collected the rent, and it
was his duty to guard his mother from unpleasantness. She observed, however, that he was remarkably
disturbed by the notice, and he assured her that Mr Wilbraham had not consulted him in the
matter at all. He wrote a letter to London, which she signed, demanding the reason of this
absurd notice flung at an ancient and perfect tenant. The reply was that Mr Wilbraham intended
to pull the houses down, beginning with Mrs Machin's, and rebuild.

"Pooh!" said Denry. "Don't you worry your head, mother; I shall arrange it. He'll be down here
soon to see his new house--it's practically finished, and the furniture is coming in--and I'll
just talk to him."

But Mr Wilbraham did not come, the explanation doubtless being that he was mad. On the other
hand, fresh notices came with amazing frequency. Mrs Machin just handed them over to Denry.
And then Denry received a telegram to say that Mr Wilbraham would be at his new house that
night and wished to see Denry there. Unfortunately, on the same day, by the afternoon post,
while Denry was at his offices, there arrived a sort of supreme and ultimate notice from London
to Mrs Machin, and it was on blue paper. It stated, baldly, that as Mrs Machin had failed to
comply with all the previous notices, had, indeed, ignored them, she and her goods would now
be ejected into the street, according to the law. It gave her twenty-four hours to flit. Never
had a respectable dame been so insulted as Mrs Machin was insulted by that notice. The prospect
of camping out in Brougham Street confronted her. When Denry reached home that evening, Mrs
Machin, as the phrase is, "gave it him."

Denry admitted frankly that he was nonplussed, staggered and outraged. But the thing was simply
another proof of Mr Wilbraham's madness. After tea he decided that his mother must put on her
best clothes, and go up with him to see Mr Wilbraham and firmly expostulate--in fact, they
would arrange the situation between them; and if Mr Wilbraham was obstinate they would defy
Mr Wilbraham. Denry explained to his mother that an Englishwoman's cottage was her castle,
that a landlord's minions had no right to force an entrance, and that the one thing that Mr
Wilbraham could do was to begin unbuilding the cottage from the top outside.... And he would
like to see Mr Wilbraham try it on!

So the sealskin mantle (for it was spring again) went up with Denry to Bleakridge.

IV

The moon shone in the chill night. The house stood back from Trafalgar Road in the moonlight--a
squarish block of a building.

"Oh!" said Mrs Machin, "it isn't so large."

"No! He didn't want it large. He only wanted it large enough," said Denry, and pushed a button
to the right of the front door. There was no reply, though they heard the ringing of the bell
inside. They waited. Mrs Machin was very nervous, but thanks to her sealskin mantle she was
not cold.

"This is a funny doorstep," she remarked, to kill time.

"It's of marble," said Denry.

"What's that for?" asked his mother.

"So much easier to keep clean," said Denry.

"Well," said Mrs Machin, "it's pretty dirty now, anyway."

It was.

"Quite simple to clean," said Denry, bending down. "You just turn this tap at the side. You
see, it's so arranged that it sends a flat jet along the step. Stand off a second."

He turned the tap, and the step was washed pure in a moment.

"How is it that that water steams?" Mrs Machin demanded.

"Because it's hot," said Denry. "Did you ever know water steam for any other reason?"

"Hot water outside?"

"Just as easy to have hot water outside as inside, isn't it?" said Denry.

"Well, I never!" exclaimed Mrs Machin. She was impressed.

"That's how everything's dodged up in this house," said Denry. He shut off the water.

And he rang once again. No answer! No illumination within the abode!

"I'll tell you what I shall do," said Denry at length. "I shall let myself in. I've got a key
of the back door."

"Are you sure it's all right?"

"I don't care if it isn't all right," said Denry, defiantly. "He asked me to be up here, and
he ought to be here to meet me. I'm not going to stand any nonsense from anybody."

In they went, having skirted round the walls of the house.

Denry closed the door, pushed a switch, and the electric light shone. Electric light was then
quite a novelty in Bursley. Mrs Machin had never seen it in action. She had to admit that it
was less complicated than oil-lamps. In the kitchen the electric light blazed upon walls tiled
in grey and a floor tiled in black and white. There was a gas range and a marble slopstone
with two taps. The woodwork was dark. Earthenware saucepans stood on a shelf. The cupboards
were full of gear chiefly in earthenware. Denry began to exhibit to his mother a tank provided
with ledges and shelves and grooves, in which he said that everything except knives could be
washed and dried automatically.

"Hadn't you better go and find your Mr Wilbraham?" she interrupted.

"So I had," said Denry; "I was forgetting him."

She heard him wandering over the house and calling in divers tones upon Mr Wilbraham. But she
heard no other voice. Meanwhile she examined the kitchen in detail, appreciating some of its
devices and failing to comprehend others.

"I expect he's missed the train," said Denry, coming back. "Anyhow, he isn't here. I may as
well show you the rest of the house now."

He led her into the hall, which was radiantly lighted.

"It's quite warm here," said Mrs Machin.

"The whole house is heated by steam," said Denry. "No fireplaces."

"No fireplaces!"

"No! No fireplaces. No grates to polish, ashes to carry down, coals to carry up, mantelpieces
to dust, fire-irons to clean, fenders to polish, chimneys to sweep."

"And suppose he wants a bit of fire all of a sudden in summer?"

"Gas stove in every room for emergencies," said Denry.

She glanced into a room.

"But," she cried, "it's all complete, ready! And as warm as toast."

"Yes," said Denry, "he gave orders. I can't think why on earth he isn't here."

At that moment an electric bell rang loud and sharp, and Mrs Machin jumped.

"There he is!" said Denry, moving to the door.

"Bless us! What will he think of us being here like?" Mrs Machin mumbled.

"Pooh!" said Denry, carelessly. And he opened the door.

V

Three persons stood on the newly-washed marble step--Mr and Mrs Cotterill and their daughter.

"Oh! Come in! Come in! Make yourselves quite at home. That's what we're doing," said Demo in
blithe greeting; and added, "I suppose he's invited you too?"

And it appeared that Mr Cecil Wilbraham had indeed invited them too. He had written from London
saying that he would be glad if Mr and Mrs Cotterill would "drop in" on this particular evening.
Further, he had mentioned that, as be had already had the pleasure of meeting Miss Cotterill,
perhaps she would accompany her parents.

"Well, he isn't here," said Denry, shaking hands. "He must have missed his train or something.
He can't possibly be here now till to-morrow. But the house seems to be all ready for him...."

"Yes, my word! And how's yourself, Mrs Cotterill?" put in Mrs Machin.

"So we may as well look over it in its finished state. I suppose that's what he asked us up
for," Denry concluded.

Mrs Machin explained quickly and nervously that she had not been comprised in any invitation;
that her errand was pure business.

"Come on upstairs," Denry called out, turning switches and adding radiance to radiance.

"Denry!" his mother protested, "I'm sure I don't know what Mr and Mrs Cotterill will think
of you! You carry on as if you owned everything in the place. I wonder at you!"

"Well," said Denry, "if anybody in this town is the owner's agent I am. And Mr Cotterill has
built the blessed house. If Wilbraham wanted to keep his old shanty to himself, he shouldn't
send out invitations. It's simple enough not to send out invitations. Now, Nellie!"

He was hanging over the balustrade at the curve of the stairs.

The familiar ease with which he said, "Now, Nellie," and especially the spontaneity of Nellie's
instant response, put new thoughts into the mind of Mrs Machin. But she neither pricked up
her ears, nor started back, nor accomplished any of the acrobatic feats which an ordinary mother
of a wealthy son would have performed under similar circumstances. Her ears did not even tremble.
And she just said:

"I like this balustrade knob being of black china."

"Every knob in the house is of black china," said Denry. "Never shows dirt. But if you should
take it into your head to clean it, you can do it with a damp cloth in a second."

Nellie now stood beside him. Nellie had grown up since the Llandudno episode. She did not blush
at a glance. When spoken to suddenly she could answer without torture to herself. She could,
in fact, maintain a conversation without breaking down for a much longer time than, a few years
ago, she had been able to skip without breaking down. She no longer imagined that all the people
in the street were staring at her, anxious to find faults in her appearance. She had temporarily
ruined the lives of several amiable and fairly innocent young men by refusing to marry them.
(For she was pretty, and her father cut a figure in the town, though her mother did not.) And
yet, despite the immense accumulation of her experiences and the weight of her varied knowledge
of human nature, there was something very girlish and timidly roguish about her as she stood
on the stairs near Denry, waiting for the elder generation to follow. The old Nellie still
lived in her.

The party passed to the first floor.

And the first floor exceeded the ground floor in marvels. In each bedroom two aluminium taps
poured hot and cold water respectively into a marble basin, and below the marble basin was
a sink. No porterage of water anywhere in the house. The water came to you, and every room
consumed its own slops. The bedsteads were of black enamelled iron and very light. The floors
were covered with linoleum, with a few rugs that could be shaken with one hand. The walls were
painted with grey enamel. Mrs Cotterill, with her all-seeing eye, observed a detail that Mrs
Machin had missed. There were no sharp corners anywhere. Every corner, every angle between
wall and floor or wall and wall, was rounded, to facilitate cleaning. And every wall, floor,
ceiling, and fixture could be washed, and all the furniture was enamelled and could be wiped
with a cloth in a moment instead of having to be polished with three cloths and many odours
in a day and a half. The bath-room was absolutely waterproof; you could spray it with a hose,
and by means of a gas apparatus you could produce an endless supply of hot water independent
of the general supply. Denry was apparently familiar with each detail of Mr Wilbraham's manifold
contrivances, and he explained them with an enormous gusto.

"Bless us!" said Mrs Machin.

"Bless us!" said Mrs Cotterill (doubtless the force of example).

They descended to the dining-room, where a supper-table had been laid by order of the invisible
Mr Cecil Wilbraham. And there the ladies lauded Mr Wilbraham's wisdom in eschewing silver.
Everything of the table service that could be of earthenware was of earthenware. The forks
and spoons were electro-plate.

"Why," Mrs Cotterill said, "I could run this house without a servant and have myself tidy by
ten o'clock in a morning."

And Mrs Machin nodded.

"And then when you want a regular turn-out, as you call it," said Denry, "there's the vacuum-cleaner."

The vacuum-cleaner was at that period the last word of civilisation, and the first agency for
it was being set up in Bursley. Denry explained the vacuum-cleaner to the housewives, who had
got no further than a Ewbank. And they again called down blessings on themselves.

"What price this supper?" Denry exclaimed. "We ought to eat it. I'm sure he'd like us to eat
it. Do sit down, all of you. I'll take the consequences."

Mrs Machin hesitated even more than the other ladies.

"It's really very strange, him not being here." She shook her head.

"Don't I tell you he's quite mad," said Denry.

"I shouldn't think he was so mad as all that," said Mrs Machin, dryly. "This is the most sensible
kind of a house I've ever seen."

"Oh! Is it?" Denry answered. "Great Scott! I never noticed those three bottles of wine on the
sideboard."

At length he succeeded in seating them at the table. Thenceforward there was no difficulty.
The ample and diversified cold supper began to disappear steadily, and the wine with it. And
as the wine disappeared so did Mr Cotterill (who had been pompous and taciturn) grow talkative,
offering to the company the exact figures of the cost of the house, and so forth. But ultimately
the sheer joy of life killed arithmetic.

Mrs Machin, however, could not quite rid herself of the notion that she was in a dream that
outraged the proprieties. The entire affair, for an unromantic spot like Bursley, was too fantastically
and wickedly romantic.

"We must be thinking about home, Denry," said she.

"Plenty of time," Denry replied. "What! All that wine gone! I'll see if there's any more in
the sideboard."

He emerged, with a red face, from bending into the deeps of the enamelled sideboard, and a
wine-bottle was in his triumphant hand. It had already been opened.

"Hooray!" he proclaimed, pouring a white wine into his glass and raising the glass: "here's
to the health of Mr Cecil Wilbraham."

He made a brave tableau in the brightness of the electric light.

Then he drank. Then he dropped the glass, which broke.

"Ugh! What's that?" he demanded, with the distorted features of a gargoyle.

His mother, who was seated next to him, seized the bottle. Denry's hand, in clasping the bottle,
had hidden a small label, which said:

"POISON--Nettleship's Patent Enamel-Cleaning Fluid. One wipe does it."

Confusion! Only Nellie Cotterill seemed to be incapable of realising that a grave accident
had occurred. She had laughed throughout the supper, and she still laughed, hysterically, though
she had drunk scarcely any wine. Her mother silenced her.

Denry was the first to recover.

"It'll be all right," said he, leaning back in his chair. "They always put a bit of poison
in those things. It can't hurt me, really. I never noticed the label."

Mrs Machin smelt at the bottle. She could detect no odour, but the fact that she could detect
no odour appeared only to increase her alarm.

"You must have an emetic instantly," she said.

"Oh no!" said Denry. "I shall be all right." And he did seem to be suddenly restored.

"You must have an emetic instantly," she repeated.

"What can I have?" he grumbled. "You can't expect to find emetics here."

"Oh yes, I can," said she. "I saw a mustard tin in a cupboard in the kitchen. Come along now,
and don't be silly."

Nellie's hysteric mirth surged up again.

Denry objected to accompanying his mother into the kitchen. But he was forced to submit. She
shut the door on both of them. It is probable that during the seven minutes which they spent
mysteriously together in the kitchen, the practicability of the kitchen apparatus for carrying
off waste products was duly tested. Denry came forth, very pale and very cross, on his mother's
arm.

"There's no danger now," said his mother, easily.

Naturally the party was at an end. The Cotterills sympathised, and prepared to depart, and
inquired whether Denry could walk home.

Denry replied, from a sofa, in a weak, expiring voice, that he was perfectly incapable of walking
home, that his sensations were in the highest degree disconcerting, that he should sleep in
that house, as the bedrooms were ready for occupation, and that he should expect his mother
to remain also.

And Mrs Machin had to concur. Mrs Machin sped the Cotterills from the door as though it had
been her own door. She was exceedingly angry and agitated. But she could not impart her feelings
to the suffering Denry. He moaned on a bed for about half-an-hour, and then fell asleep. And
in the middle of the night, in the dark, strange house, she also fell asleep.

VI

The next morning she arose and went forth, and in about half-an-hour returned. Denry was still
in bed, but his health seemed to have resumed its normal excellence. Mrs Machin burst upon
him in such a state of complicated excitement as he had never before seen her in.

"Denry," she cried, "what do you think?"

"What?" said he.

"I've just been down home, and they're--they're pulling the house down. All the furniture's
out, and they've got all the tiles off the roof, and the windows out. And there's a regular
crowd watching."

Denry sat up.

"And I can tell you another piece of news," said he. "Mr Cecil Wilbraham is dead."

"Dead!" she breathed.

"Yes," said Denry. "I think he's served his purpose. As we're here, we'll stop here. Don't
forget it's the most sensible kind of a house you've ever seen. Don't forget that Mrs Cotterill
could run it without a servant and have herself tidy by ten o'clock in a morning."

Mrs Machin perceived then, in a flash of terrible illumination, that there never had been any
Cecil Wilbraham; that Denry had merely invented him and his long moustaches and his wall eye
for the purpose of getting the better of his mother. The whole affair was an immense swindle
upon her. Not a Mr Cecil Wilbraham, but her own son had bought her cottage over her head and
jockeyed her out of it beyond any chance of getting into it again. And to defeat his mother
the rascal had not simply perverted the innocent Nellie Cotterill to some co-operation in his
scheme, but he had actually bought four other cottages, because the landlord would not sell
one alone, and he was actually demolishing property to the sole end of stopping her from re-entering
it!

Of course, the entire town soon knew of the upshot of the battle, of the year-long battle,
between Denry and his mother, and the means adopted by Denry to win. The town also had been
hoodwinked, but it did not mind that. It loved its Denry the more, and seeing that he was now
properly established in the most remarkable house in the district, it soon afterwards made
him a Town Councillor as some reward for his talent in amusing it.

And Denry would say to himself:

"Everything went like clockwork, except the mustard and water. I didn't bargain for the mustard
and water. And yet, if I was clever enough to think of putting a label on the bottle and to
have the beds prepared, I ought to have been clever enough to keep mustard out of the house."
It would be wrong to mince the unpleasant fact that the sham poisoning which he had arranged
to the end that he and his mother should pass the night in the house had finished in a manner
much too realistic for Denry's pleasure. Mustard and water, particularly when mixed by Mrs
Machin, is mustard and water. She had that consolation.

CHAPTER IX

THE GREAT NEWSPAPER WAR

I

When Denry and his mother had been established a year and a month in the new house at Bleakridge,
Denry received a visit one evening which perhaps flattered him more than anything had ever
flattered him. The visitor was Mr Myson. Now Mr Myson was the founder, proprietor and editor
of the Five Towns Weekly, a new organ of public opinion which had been in existence about a
year; and Denry thought that Mr Myson had popped in to see him in pursuit of an advertisement
of the Thrift Club, and at first he was not at all flattered.

But Mr Myson was not hunting for advertisements, and Denry soon saw him to be the kind of man
who would be likely to depute that work to others. Of middle height, well and quietly dressed,
with a sober, assured deportment, he spoke in a voice and accent that were not of the Five
Towns; they were superior to the Five Towns. And in fact Mr Myson originated in Manchester
and had seen London. He was not provincial, and he beheld the Five Towns as part of the provinces;
which no native of the Five Towns ever succeeds in doing. Nevertheless, his manner to Denry
was the summit of easy and yet deferential politeness.

He asked permission "to put something before" Denry. And when, rather taken aback by such smooth
phrases, Denry had graciously accorded the permission, he gave a brief history of the Five
Towns Weekly, showing how its circulation had grown, and definitely stating that at that moment
it was yielding a profit. Then he said:

"Now my scheme is to turn it into a daily."

"Very good notion," said Denry, instinctively.

"I'm glad you think so," said Mr Myson. "Because I've come here in the hope of getting your
assistance. I'm a stranger to the district, and I want the co-operation of some one who isn't.
So I've come to you. I need money, of course, though I have myself what most people would consider
sufficient capital. But what I need more than money is--well--moral support."

"And who put you on to me?" asked Denry.

Mr Myson smiled. "I put myself on to you," said he. "I think I may say I've got my bearings
in the Five Towns, after over a year's journalism in it, and it appeared to me that you were
the best man I could approach. I always believe in flying high."

Therein was Denry flattered. The visit seemed to him to seal his position in the district in
a way in which his election to the Bursley Town Council had failed to do. He had been somehow
disappointed with that election. He had desired to display his interest in the serious welfare
of the town, and to answer his opponent's arguments with better ones. But the burgesses of
his ward appeared to have no passionate love of logic. They just cried "Good old Denry!" and
elected him--with a majority of only forty-one votes. He had expected to feel a different Denry
when he could put "Councillor" before his name. It was not so. He had been solemnly in the
mayoral procession to church, he had attended meetings of the council, he had been nominated
to the Watch Committee. But he was still precisely the same Denry, though the youngest member
of the council. But now he was being recognised from the outside. Mr Myson's keen Manchester
eye, ranging over the quarter of a million inhabitants of the Five Towns in search of a representative
individual force, had settled on Denry Machin. Yes, he was flattered. Mr Myson's choice threw
a rose-light on all Denry's career: his wealth and its origin; his house and stable, which
were the astonishment and the admiration of the town; his Universal Thrift Club; yea, and his
councillorship! After all, these were marvels. (And possibly the greatest marvel was the resigned
presence of his mother in that wondrous house, and the fact that she consented to employ Rose
Chudd, the incomparable Sappho of charwomen, for three hours every day.)

In fine, he perceived from Mr Myson's eyes that his position was unique.

And after they had chatted a little, and the conversation had deviated momentarily from journalism
to house property, he offered to display Machin House (as he had christened it) to Mr Myson,
and Mr Myson was really impressed beyond the ordinary. Mr Myson's homage to Mrs Machin, whom
they chanced on in the paradise of the bath-room, was the polished mirror of courtesy. How
Denry wished that he could behave like that when he happened to meet countesses.

Then, once more in the drawing-room, they resumed the subject of newspapers.

"You know," said Mr Myson, "it's really a very bad thing indeed for a district to have only
one daily newspaper. I've nothing myself to say against The Staffordshire Signal, but you'd
perhaps be astonished"--this in a confidential tone--"at the feeling there is against the Signal
in many quarters."

"Really!" said Denry.

"Of course its fault is that it isn't sufficiently interested in the great public questions
of the district. And it can't be. Because it can't take a definite side. It must try to please
all parties. At any rate it must offend none. That is the great evil of a journalistic monopoly....
Two hundred and fifty thousand people--why! there is an ample public for two first-class papers.
Look at Nottingham! Look at Bristol! Look at Leeds! Look at Sheffield!...and their newspapers."

And Denry endeavoured to look at these great cities! Truly the Five Towns was just about as big.

The dizzy journalistic intoxication seized him. He did not give Mr Myson an answer at once,
but he gave himself an answer at once. He would go into the immense adventure. He was very
friendly with the Signal people--certainly; but business was business, and the highest welfare
of the Five Towns was the highest welfare of the Five Towns.

Soon afterwards all the hoardings of the district spoke with one blue voice, and said that
the Five Towns Weekly was to be transformed into the Five Towns Daily, with four editions,
beginning each day at noon, and that the new organ would be conducted on the lines of a first-class
evening paper.

The inner ring of knowing ones knew that a company entitled "The Five Towns Newspapers, Limited,"
had been formed, with a capital of ten thousand pounds, and that Mr Myson held three thousand
pounds' worth of shares, and the great Denry Machin one thousand five hundred, and that the
remainder were to be sold and allotted as occasion demanded. The inner ring said that nothing
would ever be able to stand up against the Signal. On the other hand, it admitted that Denry,
the most prodigious card ever born into the Five Towns, had never been floored by anything.
The inner ring anticipated the future with glee. Denry and Mr Myson anticipated the future
with righteous confidence. As for the Signal, it went on its august way, blind to sensational
hoardings.

II

On the day of the appearance of the first issue of the Five Towns Daily, the offices of the
new paper at Hanbridge gave proof of their excellent organisation, working in all details with
an admirable smoothness. In the basement a Marinoni machine thundered like a sucking dove to
produce fifteen thousand copies an hour. On the ground floor ingenious arrangements had been
made for publishing the paper; in particular, the iron railings to keep the boys in order in
front of the publishing counter had been imitated from the Signal. On the first floor was the
editor and founder with his staff, and above that the composing department. The number of stairs
that separated the composing department from the machine-room was not a positive advantage,
but bricks and mortar are inelastic, and one does what one can. The offices looked very well
from the outside, and they compared passably with the offices of the Signal close by. The posters
were duly in the ground-floor windows, and gold signs, one above another to the roof, produced
an air of lucrative success.

Denry happened to be in the Daily offices that afternoon. He had had nothing to do with the
details of organisation, for details of organisation were not his speciality. His speciality
was large, leading ideas. He knew almost nothing of the agreements with correspondents and
Press Association and Central News, and the racing services and the fiction syndicates, nor
of the difficulties with the Compositors' Union, nor of the struggle to lower the price of
paper by the twentieth of a penny per pound, nor of the awful discounts allowed to certain
advertisers, nor of the friction with the railway company, nor of the sickening adulation that
had been lavished on quite unimportant newsagents, nor--worst of all--of the dearth of newsboys.
These matters did not attract him. He could not stoop to them. But when Mr Myson, calm and
proud, escorted him down to the machine-room, and the Marinoni threw a folded pink Daily almost
into his hands, and it looked exactly like a real newspaper, and he saw one of his own descriptive
articles in it, and he reflected that he was an owner of it--then Denry was attracted and delighted,
and his heart beat. For this pink thing was the symbol and result of the whole affair, and
had the effect of a miracle on him.

And he said to himself, never guessing how many thousands of men had said it before him, that
a newspaper was the finest toy in the world.

About four o'clock the publisher, in shirt sleeves and an apron, came up to Mr Myson and respectfully
asked him to step into the publishing office. Mr Myson stepped into the publishing office and
Denry with him, and they there beheld a small ragged boy with a bleeding nose and a bundle
of Dailys in his wounded hand.

"Yes," the boy sobbed; "and they said they'd cut my eyes out and plee [play] marbles wi' 'em,
if they cotched me in Crown Square agen," And he threw down the papers with a final yell.

The two directors learnt that the delicate threat had been uttered by four Signal boys, who
had objected to any fellow-boys offering any paper other than the Signal for sale in Crown
Square or anywhere else.

Of course, it was absurd.

Still, absurd as it was, it continued. The central publishing offices of the Daily at Hanbridge,
and its branch offices in the neighbouring towns, were like military hospitals, and the truth
appeared to the directors that while the public was panting to buy copies of the Daily, the
sale of the Daily was being prevented by means of a scandalous conspiracy on the part of Signal
boys. For it must be understood that in the Five Towns people prefer to catch their newspaper
in the street as it flies and cries. The Signal had a vast army of boys, to whom every year
it gave a great fête. Indeed, the Signal possessed nearly all the available boys, and assuredly
all the most pugilistic and strongest boys. Mr Myson had obtained boys only after persistent
inquiry and demand, and such as he had found were not the fittest, and therefore were unlikely
to survive. You would have supposed that in a district that never ceases to grumble about bad
trade and unemployment, thousands of boys would have been delighted to buy the Daily at fourpence
a dozen and sell it at sixpence. But it was not so.

On the second day the dearth of boys at the offices of the Daily was painful. There was that
magnificent, enterprising newspaper waiting to be sold, and there was the great enlightened
public waiting to buy; and scarcely any business could be done because the Signal boys had
established a reign of terror over their puny and upstart rivals!

The situation was unthinkable.

Still, unthinkable as it was, it continued. Mr Myson had thought of everything except this.
Naturally it had not occurred to him that an immense and serious effort for the general weal
was going to be blocked by a gang of tatterdemalions.

He complained with dignity to the Signal, and was informed with dignity by the Signal that
the Signal could not be responsible for the playful antics of its boys in the streets; that,
in short, the Five Towns was a free country. In the latter proposition Mr Myson did not concur.

After trouble in the persuasion of parents--astonishing how indifferent the Five Towns' parent
was to the loss of blood by his offspring!--a case reached the police-court. At the hearing
the Signal gave a solicitor a watching brief, and that solicitor expressed the Signal's horror
of carnage. The evidence was excessively contradictory, and the Stipendiary dismissed the summons
with a good joke. The sole definite result was that the boy whose father had ostensibly brought
the summons, got his ear torn within a quarter of an hour of leaving the court. Boys will be boys.

Still, the Daily had so little faith in human nature that it could not believe that the Signal
was not secretly encouraging its boys to be boys. It could not believe that the Signal, out
of a sincere desire for fair play and for the highest welfare of the district, would willingly
sacrifice nearly half its circulation and a portion of its advertisement revenue. And the hurt
tone of Mr Myson's leading articles seemed to indicate that in Mr Myson's opinion his older
rival ought to do everything in its power to ruin itself. The Signal never spoke of the fight.
The Daily gave shocking details of it every day.

The struggle trailed on through the weeks.

Then Denry had one of his ideas. An advertisement was printed in the Daily for two hundred
able-bodied men to earn two shillings for working six hours a day. An address different from
the address of the Daily was given. By a ruse Denry procured the insertion of the advertisement
in the Signal also.

"We must expend our capital on getting the paper on to the streets," said Denry. "That's evident.
We'll have it sold by men. We'll soon see if the Signal ragamuffins will attack them. And we
won't pay 'em by results; we'll pay 'em a fixed wage; that'll fetch 'em. And a commission on
sales into the bargain. Why! I wouldn't mind engaging five hundred men. Swamp the streets!
That's it! Hang expense. And when we've done the trick, then we can go back to the boys; they'll
have learnt their lesson."

And Mr Myson agreed and was pleased that Denry was living up to his reputation.

The state of the earthenware trade was supposed that summer to be worse than it had been since
1869, and the grumblings of the unemployed were prodigious, even seditious. Mr Myson therefore,
as a measure of precaution, engaged a couple of policemen to ensure order at the address, and
during the hours, named in the advertisement as a rendezvous for respectable men in search
of a well-paid job. Having regard to the thousands of perishing families in the Five Towns,
he foresaw a rush and a crush of eager breadwinners. Indeed, the arrangements were elaborate.

Forty minutes after the advertised time for the opening of the reception of respectable men
in search of money, four men had arrived. Mr Myson, mystified, thought that there had been
a mistake in the advertisement, but there was no mistake in the advertisement. A little later
two more men came. Of the six, three were tipsy, and the other three absolutely declined to
be seen selling papers in the streets. Two were abusive, one facetious. Mr Myson did not know
his Five Towns; nor did Denry. A Five Towns' man, when he can get neither bread nor beer, will
keep himself and his family on pride and water. The policemen went off to more serious duties.

III

Then came the announcement of the thirty-fifth anniversary of the Signal, and of the processional
fête by which the Signal was at once to give itself a splendid spectacular advertisement and
to reward and enhearten its boys. The Signal meant to liven up the streets of the Five Towns
on that great day by means of a display of all the gilt chariots of Snape's Circus in the main
thoroughfare. Many of the boys would be in the gilt chariots. Copies of the anniversary number
of the Signal would be sold from the gilt chariots. The idea was excellent, and it showed that
after all the Signal was getting just a little more afraid of its young rival than it had pretended
to be.

For, strange to say, after a trying period of hesitation, the Five Towns Daily was slightly
on the upward curve--thanks to Denry. Denry did not mean to be beaten by the puzzle which the
Daily offered to his intelligence. There the Daily was, full of news, and with quite an encouraging
show of advertisements, printed on real paper with real ink--and yet it would not "go." Notoriously
the Signal earned a net profit of at the very least five thousand a year, whereas the Daily
earned a net loss of at the very least sixty pounds a week--and of that sixty quite a third
was Denry's money. He could not explain it. Mr Myson tried to rouse the public by passionately
stirring up extremely urgent matters--such as the smoke nuisance, the increase of the rates,
the park question, German competition, technical education for apprentices; but the public
obstinately would not be roused concerning its highest welfare to the point of insisting on
a regular supply of the Daily. If a mere five thousand souls had positively demanded daily
a copy of the Daily and not slept till boys or agents had responded to their wish, the troubles
of the Daily would soon have vanished. But this ridiculous public did not seem to care which
paper was put into its hand in exchange for its halfpenny, so long as the sporting news was
put there. It simply was indifferent. It failed to see the importance to such an immense district
of having two flourishing and mutually-opposing daily organs. The fundamental boy difficulty
remained ever present.

And it was the boy difficulty that Denry perseveringly and ingeniously attacked, until at length
the Daily did indeed possess some sort of a brigade of its own, and the bullying and slaughter
in the streets (so amusing to the inhabitants) grew a little less one-sided.

A week or more before the Signal's anniversary day, Denry heard that the Signal was secretly
afraid lest the Daily's brigade might accomplish the marring of its gorgeous procession, and
that the Signal was ready to do anything to smash the Daily's brigade. He laughed; he said
he did not mind. About that time hostilities were rather acute; blood was warming, and both
papers, in the excitation of rivalry, had partially lost the sense of what was due to the dignity
of great organs. By chance a tremendous local football match--Knype v: Bursley--fell on the
very Saturday of the procession. The rival arrangements for the reporting of the match were
as tremendous as the match itself, and somehow the match seemed to add keenness to the journalistic
struggle, especially as the Daily favoured Bursley and the Signal was therefore forced to favour
Knype.

By all the laws of hazard there ought to have been a hitch on that historic Saturday. Telephone
or telegraph ought to have broken down, or rain ought to have made play impossible, but no
hitch occurred. And at five-thirty o'clock of a glorious afternoon in earliest November the
Daily went to press with a truly brilliant account of the manner in which Bursley (for the
first and last time in its history) had defeated Knype by one goal to none. Mr Myson was proud.
Mr Myson defied the Signal to beat his descriptive report. As for the Signal's procession--well,
Mr Myson and the chief sub-editor of the Daily glanced at each other and smiled.

And a few minutes later the Daily boys were rushing out of the publishing room with bundles
of papers--assuredly in advance of the Signal.

It was at this juncture that the unexpected began to occur to the Daily boys. The publishing
door of the Daily opened into Stanway Rents, a narrow alley in a maze of mean streets behind
Crown Square. In Stanway Rents was a small warehouse in which, according to rumours of the
afternoon, a free soup kitchen was to be opened. And just before the football edition of the
Daily came off the Marinoni, it emphatically was opened, and there issued from its inviting
gate an odour--not, to be sure, of soup, but of toasted cheese and hot jam--such an odour as
had never before tempted the nostrils of a Daily boy; a unique and omnipotent odour. Several
boys (who, I may state frankly, were traitors to the Daily cause, spies and mischief-makers
from elsewhere) raced unhesitatingly in, crying that toasted cheese sandwiches and jam tarts
were to be distributed like lightning to all authentic newspaper lads.

The entire gang followed--scores, over a hundred--inwardly expecting to emerge instantly with
teeth fully employed, followed like sheep into a fold.

And the gate was shut.

Toasted cheese and hot jammy pastry were faithfully served to the ragged host--but with no
breathless haste. And when, loaded, the boys struggled to depart, they were instructed by the
kind philanthropist who had fed them to depart by another exit, and they discovered themselves
In an enclosed yard, of which the double doors were apparently unyielding. And the warehouse
door was shut also. And as the cheese and jam disappeared, shouts of fury arose on the air.
The yard was so close to the offices of the Daily that the chimneypots of those offices could
actually be seen. And yet the shouting brought no answer from the lords of the Daily, congratulating
themselves up there on their fine account of the football match, and on their celerity in going
to press and on the loyalty of their brigade.

The Signal, it need not be said, disavowed complicity in this extraordinary entrapping of the
Daily brigade by means of an odour. Could it be held responsible for the excesses of its disinterested
sympathisers?... Still, the appalling trick showed the high temperature to which blood had
risen in the genial battle between great rival organs. Persons in the inmost ring whispered
that Denry Machin had at length been bested on this critically important day.

IV

Snape's Circus used to be one of the great shining institutions of North Staffordshire, trailing
its magnificence on sculptured wheels from town to town, and occupying the dreams of boys from
one generation to another. Its headquarters were at Axe, in the Moorlands, ten miles away from
Hanbridge, but the riches of old Snape had chiefly come from the Five Towns. At the time of
the struggle between the Signal and the Daily its decline had already begun. The aged proprietor
had recently died, and the name, and the horses, and the chariots, and the carefully-repaired
tents had been sold to strangers. On the Saturday of the anniversary and the football match
(which was also Martinmas Saturday) the circus was set up at Oldcastle, on the edge of the
Five Towns, and was giving its final performances of the season. Even boys will not go to circuses
in the middle of a Five Towns' winter. The Signal people had hired the processional portion
of Snape's for the late afternoon and early evening. And the instructions were that the entire
cortège should be round about the Signal offices, in marching order, not later than five o'clock.

But at four o'clock several gentlemen with rosettes in their button-holes and Signal posters
in their hands arrived important and panting at the fair-ground at Oldcastle, and announced
that the programme had been altered at the last moment, in order to defeat certain feared machinations
of the unscrupulous Daily. The cavalcade was to be split into three groups, one of which, the
chief, was to enter Hanbridge by a "back road," and the other two were to go to Bursley and
Longshaw respectively. In this manner the forces of advertisement would be distributed, and
the chief parts of the district equally honoured.

The special linen banners, pennons, and ribbons--bearing the words--

  "SIGNAL: THIRTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY," &c.

had already been hung and planted and draped about the gilded summits of the chariots. And
after some delay the processions were started, separating at the bottom of the Cattle Market.
The head of the Hanbridge part of the procession consisted of an enormous car of Jupiter, with
six wheels and thirty-six paregorical figures (as the clown used to say), and drawn by six
piebald steeds guided by white reins. This coach had a windowed interior (at the greater fairs
it sometimes served as a box-office) and in the interior one of the delegates of the Signal
had fixed himself; from it he directed the paths of the procession.

It would be futile longer to conceal that the delegate of the Signal in the bowels of the car
of Jupiter was not honestly a delegate of the Signal at all. He was, indeed, Denry Machin,
and none other. From this single fact it will be seen to what extent the representatives of
great organs had forgotten what was due to their dignity and to public decency. Ensconced in
his lair Denry directed the main portion of the Signal's advertising procession by all manner
of discreet lanes round the skirts of Hanbridge and so into the town from the hilly side. And
ultimately the ten vehicles halted in Crapper Street, to the joy of the simple inhabitants.

Denry emerged and wandered innocently towards the offices of his paper, which were close by.
It was getting late. The first yelling of the imprisoned Daily boys was just beginning to rise
on the autumn air.

Suddenly Denry was accosted by a young man.

"Hello, Machin!" cried the young man. "What have you shaved your beard off, for? I scarcely
knew you."

"I just thought I would, Swetnam," said Denry, who was obviously discomposed.

It was the youngest of the Swetnam boys; he and Denry had taken a sort of curt fancy to one
another.

"I say," said Swetnam, confidentially, as if obeying a swift impulse, "I did hear that the
Signal people meant to collar all your chaps this afternoon, and I believe they have done.
Hear that now?" (Swetnam's father was intimate with the Signal people.)

"I know," Denry replied.

"But I mean--papers and all."

"I know," said Denry.

"Oh!" murmured Swetnam.

"But I'll tell you a secret," Denry added. "They aren't to-day's papers. They're yesterday's,
and last week's and last month's. We've been collecting them specially and keeping them nice
and new-looking."

"Well, you're a caution!" murmured Swetnam.

"I am," Denry agreed.

A number of men rushed at that instant with bundles of the genuine football edition from the
offices of the Daily.

"Come on!" Denry cried to them. "Come on! This way! By-by, Swetnam."

And the whole file vanished round a corner. The yelling of imprisoned cheese-fed boys grew louder.

V

In the meantime at the Signal office (which was not three hundred yards away, but on the other
side of Crown Square) apprehension had deepened into anxiety as the minutes passed and the
Snape Circus procession persisted in not appearing on the horizon of the Oldcastle Road. The
Signal would have telephoned to Snape's, but for the fact that a circus is never on the telephone.
It then telephoned to its Oldcastle agent, who, after a long delay, was able to reply that
the cavalcade had left Oldcastle at the appointed hour, with every sign of health and energy.
Then the Signal sent forth scouts all down the Oldcastle Road to put spurs into the procession,
and the scouts returned, having seen nothing. Pessimists glanced at the possibility of the
whole procession having fallen into the canal at Cauldon Bridge. The paper was printed, the
train-parcels for Knype, Longshaw, Bursley, and Turnhill were despatched; the boys were waiting;
the fingers of the clock in the publishing department were simply flying. It had been arranged
that the bulk of the Hanbridge edition, and in particular the first copies of it, should be
sold by boys from the gilt chariots themselves. The publisher hesitated for an awful moment,
and then decided that he could wait no more, and that the boys must sell the papers in the
usual way from the pavements and gutters. There was no knowing what the Daily might not be doing.

And then Signal boys in dozens rushed forth paper-laden, but they were disappointed boys; they
had thought to ride in gilt chariots, not to paddle in mud. And almost the first thing they
saw in Crown Square was the car of Jupiter in its glory, flying all the Signal colours; and
other cars behind. They did not rush now; they sprang, as from a catapult; and alighted like
flies on the vehicles. Men insisted on taking their papers from them and paying for them on
the spot. The boys were startled; they were entirely puzzled; but they had not the habit of
refusing money. And off went the procession to the music of its own band down the road to Knype,
and perhaps a hundred boys on board, cheering. The men in charge then performed a curious act:
they tore down all the Signal flagging, and replaced it with the emblem of the Daily.

So that all the great and enlightened public wandering home in crowds from the football match
at Knype, had the spectacle of a Daily procession instead of a Signal procession, and could
scarce believe their eyes. And Dailys were sold in quantities from the cars. At Knype Station
the procession curved and returned to Hanbridge, and finally, after a multitudinous triumph,
came to a stand with all its Daily bunting in front of the Signal offices; and Denry appeared
from his lair. Denry's men fled with bundles.

"They're an hour and a half late," said Denry calmly to one of the proprietors of the Signal,
who was on the pavement. "But I've managed to get them here. I thought I'd just look in to
thank you for giving such a good feed to our lads."

The telephones hummed with news of similar Daily processions in Longshaw and Bursley. And there
was not a high-class private bar in the district that did not tinkle with delighted astonishment
at the brazen, the inconceivable effrontery of that card, Denry Machin. Many people foresaw
law-suits, but it was agreed that the Signal had begun the game of impudence in trapping the
Daily lads so as to secure a holy calm for its much-trumpeted procession.

And Denry had not finished with the Signal.

In the special football edition of the Daily was an announcement, the first, of special Martinmas
fêtes organised by the Five Towns Daily. And on the same morning every member of the Universal
Thrift Club had received an invitation to the said fêtes. They were three--held on public ground
at Hanbridge, Bursley, and Longshaw. They were in the style of the usual Five Towns "wakes";
that is to say, roundabouts, shows, gingerbread stalls, swings, cocoanut shies. But at each
fête a new and very simple form of "shy" had been erected. It consisted of a row of small railway
signals.

"March up! March up!" cried the shy-men. "Knock down the signal! Knock down the signal! And
a packet of Turkish delight is yours. Knock down the signal!"

And when you had knocked down the signal the men cried:

"We wrap it up for you in the special Anniversary Number of the Signal."

And they disdainfully tore into suitable fragments copies of the Signal which had cost Denry
& Co. a halfpenny each, and enfolded the Turkish delight therein, and handed it to you with
a smack.

And all the fair-grounds were carpeted with draggled and muddy Signals. People were up to the
ankles in Signals.

The affair was the talk of Sunday. Few matters in the Five Towns have raised more gossip than
did that enormous escapade which Denry invented and conducted. The moral damage to the Signal
was held to approach the disastrous. And now not the possibility but the probability of law-suits
was incessantly discussed.

On the Monday both papers were bought with anxiety. Everybody was frothing to know what the
respective editors would say.

But in neither sheet was there a single word as to the affair. Both had determined to be discreet;
both were afraid. The Signal feared lest it might not, if the pinch came, be able to prove
its innocence of the crime of luring boys into confinement by means of toasted cheese and hot
jam. The Signal had also to consider its seriously damaged dignity; for such wounds silence
is the best dressing. The Daily was comprehensively afraid. It had practically driven its gilded
chariots through the entire Decalogue. Moreover, it had won easily in the grand altercation.
It was exquisitely conscious of glory.

Denry went away to Blackpool, doubtless to grow his beard.

The proof of the Daily's moral and material victory was that soon afterwards there were four
applicants, men of substance, for shares in the Daily company. And this, by the way, was the
end of the tale. For these applicants, who secured options on a majority of the shares, were
emissaries of the Signal. Armed with the options, the Signal made terms with its rival, and
then by mutual agreement killed it. The price of its death was no trifle, but it was less than
a year's profits of the Signal. Denry considered that he had been "done." But in the depths
of his heart he was glad that he had been done. He had had too disconcerting a glimpse of the
rigours and perils of journalism to wish to continue it. He had scored supremely and, for him,
to score was life itself. His reputation as a card was far, far higher than ever. Had he so
desired, he could have been elected to the House of Commons on the strength of his procession
and fête.

Mr Myson, somewhat scandalised by the exuberance of his partner, returned to Manchester.

And the Signal, subsequently often referred to as "The Old Lady," resumed its monopolistic
sway over the opinions of a quarter of a million of people, and has never since been attacked.

CHAPTER X

HIS INFAMY

I

When Denry at a single stroke "wherreted" his mother and proved his adventurous spirit by becoming
the possessor of one of the first motor-cars ever owned in Bursley, his instinct naturally
was to run up to Councillor Cotterill's in it. Not that he loved Councillor Cotterill, and
therefore wished to make him a partaker in his joy; for he did not love Councillor Cotterill.
He had never been able to forgive Nellie's father for those patronising airs years and years
before at Llandudno, airs indeed which had not even yet disappeared from Cotterill's attitude
towards Denry. Though they were Councillors on the same Town Council, though Denry was getting
richer and Cotterill was assuredly not getting richer, the latter's face and tone always seemed
to be saying to Denry: "Well, you are not doing so badly for a beginner." So Denry did not
care to lose an opportunity of impressing Councillor Cotterill. Moreover, Denry had other reasons
for going up to the Cotterills. There existed a sympathetic bond between him and Mrs Cotterill,
despite her prim taciturnity and her exasperating habit of sitting with her hands pressed tight
against her body and one over the other. Occasionally he teased her--and she liked being teased.
He had glimpses now and then of her secret soul; he was perhaps the only person in Bursley
thus privileged. Then there was Nellie. Denry and Nellie were great friends. For the rest of
the world she had grown up, but not for Denry, who treated her as the chocolate child; while
she, if she called him anything, called him respectfully "Mr."

The Cotterills had a fairly large old house with a good garden "up Bycars Lane," above the
new park and above all those red streets which Mr Cotterill had helped to bring into being.
Mr Cotterill built new houses with terra-cotta facings for others, but preferred an old one
in stucco for himself. His abode had been saved from the parcelling out of several Georgian
estates. It was dignified. It had a double entrance gate, and from this portal the drive started
off for the house door, but deliberately avoided reaching the house door until it had wandered
in curves over the entire garden. That was the Georgian touch! The modern touch was shown in
Councillor Cotterill's bay windows, bath-room and garden squirter. There was stabling, in which
were kept a Victorian dogcart and a Georgian horse, used by the Councillor in his business.
As sure as ever his wife or daughter wanted the dogcart, it was either out or just going out,
or the Georgian horse was fatigued and needed repose. The man who groomed the Georgian also
ploughed the flowerbeds, broke the windows in cleaning them, and put blacking on brown boots.
Two indoor servants had differing views as to the frontier between the kingdom of his duties
and the kingdom of theirs, in fact, it was the usual spacious household of successful trade
in a provincial town.

Denry got to Bycars Lane without a breakdown. This was in the days, quite thirteen years ago,
when automobilists made their wills and took food supplies when setting forth. Hence Denry
was pleased. The small but useful fund of prudence in him, however, forbade him to run the
car along the unending sinuous drive. The May night was fine, and he left the loved vehicle
with his new furs in the shadow of a monkey-tree near the gate.

As he was crunching towards the door, he had a beautiful idea: "I'll take 'em all out for a
spin. There'll just be room!" he said.

Now even to-day, when the very cabman drives his automobile, a man who buys a motor cannot
say to a friend: "I've bought a motor. Come for a spin," in the same self-unconscious accents
as he would say: "I've bought a boat. Come for a sail," or "I've bought a house. Come and look
at it." Even to-day and in the centre of London there is still something about a motor--well
something.... Everybody who has bought a motor, and everybody who has dreamed of buying a motor,
will comprehend me. Useless to feign that a motor is the most banal thing imaginable. It is
not. It remains the supreme symbol of swagger. If such is the effect of a motor in these days
and in Berkeley Square, what must it have been in that dim past, and in that dim town three
hours by the fastest express from Euston? The imagination must be forced to the task of answering
this question. Then will it be understood that Denry was simply tingling with pride.

"Master in?" he demanded of the servant, who was correctly starched, but unkempt in detail.

"No, sir. He ain't been in for tea."

("I shall take the women out then," said Denry to himself.)

"Come in! Come in!" cried a voice from the other side of the open door of the drawing-room,
Nellie's voice! The manners and state of a family that has industrially risen combine the spectacular
grandeur of the caste to which it has climbed with the ease and freedom of the caste which
it has quitted.

"Such a surprise!" said the voice. Nellie appeared, rosy.

Denry threw his new motoring cap hastily on to the hall-stand. No! He did not hope that Nellie
would see it. He hoped that she would not see it. Now that the moment was really come to declare
himself the owner of a motor-car, he grew timid and nervous. He would have liked to hide his
hat. But then Denry was quite different from our common humanity. He was capable even of feeling
awkward in a new suit of clothes. A singular person.

"Hello!" she greeted him.

"Hello!" he greeted her.

Their hands touched.

"Father hasn't come yet," she added. He fancied she was not quite at ease.

"Well," he said, "what's this surprise."

She motioned him into the drawing-room.

The surprise was a wonderful woman, brilliant in black--not black silk, but a softer, delicate
stuff. She reclined in an easy-chair with surpassing grace and self-possession. A black Egyptian
shawl, spangled with silver, was slipping off her shoulders. Her hair was dressed--that is
to say, it was dressed; it was obviously and thrillingly a work of elaborate art. He could
see her two feet and one of her ankles. The boots, the open-work stocking--such boots, such
an open-work stocking, had never been seen in Bursley, not even at a ball! She was in mourning,
and wore scarcely any jewellery, but there was a gleaming tint of gold here and there among
the black, which resulted in a marvellous effect of richness.

The least experienced would have said, and said rightly: "This must be a woman of wealth and
fashion." It was the detail that finished the demonstration. The detail was incredible. There
might have been ten million stitches in the dress. Ten sempstresses might have worked on the
dress for ten years. An examination of it under a microscope could but have deepened one's
amazement at it.

She was something new in the Five Towns, something quite new.

Denry was not equal to the situation. He seldom was equal to a small situation. And although
he had latterly acquired a considerable amount of social savoir, he was constantly mislaying
it, so that he could not put his hand on it at the moment when he most required it, as now.

"Well, Denry!" said the wondrous creature in black, softly.

And he collected himself as though for a plunge, and said:

"Well, Ruth!"

This was the woman whom he had once loved, kissed, and engaged himself to marry. He was relieved
that she had begun with Christian names, because he could not recall her surname. He could
not even remember whether he had ever heard it. All he knew was that, after leaving Bursley
to join her father in Birmingham, she had married somebody with a double name, somebody well
off, somebody older than herself; somebody apparently of high social standing; and that this
somebody had died.

She made no fuss. There was no implication in her demeanour that she expected to be wept over
as a lone widow, or that because she and he had on a time been betrothed, therefore they could
never speak naturally to each other again. She just talked as if nothing had ever happened
to her, and as if about twenty-four hours had elapsed since she had last seen him. He felt
that she must have picked up this most useful diplomatic calmness in her contacts with her
late husband's class. It was a valuable lesson to him: "Always behave as if nothing had happened
--no matter what has happened."

To himself he was saying:

"I'm glad I came up in my motor."

He seemed to need something in self-defence against the sudden attack of all this wealth and
all this superior social tact, and the motor-car served excellently.

"I've been hearing a great deal about you lately," said she with a soft smile, unobtrusively
rearranging a fold of her skirt.

"Well," he replied, "I'm sorry I can't say the same of you."

Slightly perilous perhaps, but still he thought it rather neat.

"Oh!" she said. "You see I've been so much out of England. We were just talking about holidays.
I was saying to Mrs Cotterill they certainly ought to go to Switzerland this year for a change."

"Yes, Mrs Capron-Smith was just saying--" Mrs Cotterill put in.

(So that was her name.)

"It would be something too lovely!" said Nellie in ecstasy.

Switzerland! Astonishing how with a single word she had marked the gulf between Bursley people
and herself. The Cotterills had never been out of England. Not merely that, but the Cotterills
had never dreamt of going out of England. Denry had once been to Dieppe, and had come back
as though from Timbuctoo with a traveller's renown. And she talked of Switzerland easily!

"I suppose it is very jolly," he said.

"Yes," she said, "it's splendid in summer. But, of course, the time is winter, for the sports.
Naturally, when you aren't free to take a bit of a holiday in winter, you must be content with
summer, and very splendid it is. I'm sure you'd enjoy it frightfully, Nell."

"I'm sure I should--frightfully!" Nellie agreed. "I shall speak to father. I shall make him--"

"Now, Nellie--" her mother warned her.

"Yes, I shall, mother," Nellie insisted.

"There is your father!" observed Mrs Cotterill, after listening.

Footsteps crossed the hall, and died away into the dining-room.

"I wonder why on earth father doesn't come in here. He must have heard us talking," said Nellie,
like a tyrant crossed in some trifle.

A bell rang, and then the servant came into the drawing-room and remarked: "If you please,
mum," at Mrs Cotterill, and Mrs Cotterill disappeared, closing the door after her.

"What are they up to, between them?" Nellie demanded, and she, too, departed, with wrinkled
brow, leaving Denry and Ruth together. It could be perceived on Nellie's brow that her father
was going "to catch it."

"I haven't seen Mr Cotterill yet," said Mrs Capron-Smith.

"When did you come?" Denry asked.

"Only this afternoon."

She continued to talk.

As he looked at her, listening and responding intelligently now and then, he saw that Mrs Capron-Smith
was in truth the woman that Ruth had so cleverly imitated ten years before. The imitation had
deceived him then; he had accepted it for genuine. It would not have deceived him now--he knew
that. Oh yes! This was the real article that could hold its own anywhere.... Switzerland! And
not simply Switzerland, but a refinement on Switzerland! Switzerland in winter! He divined
that in her opinion Switzerland in summer was not worth doing--in the way of correctness. But
in winter...

II

Nellie had announced a surprise for Denry as he entered the house, but Nellie's surprise for
Denry, startling and successful though it proved, was as naught to the surprise which Mr Cotterill
had in hand for Nellie, her mother, Denry, the town of Bursley, and various persons up and
down the country.

Mrs Cotterill came hysterically in upon the duologue between Denry and Ruth in the drawing-room.
From the activity of her hands, which, instead of being decently folded one over the other,
were waving round her head in the strangest way, it was clear that Mrs Cotterill was indeed
under the stress of a very unusual emotion.

"It's those creditors--at last! I knew it would be! It's all those creditors! They won't let
him alone, and now they've done it."

So Mrs Cotterill! She dropped into a chair. She had no longer any sense of shame, of what was
due to her dignity. She seemed to have forgotten that certain matters are not proper to be
discussed in drawing-rooms. She had left the room Mrs Councillor Cotterill; she returned to
it nobody in particular, the personification of defeat. The change had operated in five minutes.

Mrs Capron-Smith and Denry glanced at each other, and even Mrs Capron-Smith was at a loss for
a moment. Then Ruth approached Mrs Cotterill and took her hand. Perhaps Mrs Capron-Smith was
not so astonished after all. She and Nellie's mother had always been "very friendly." And in
the Five Towns "very friendly" means a lot.

"Perhaps if you were to leave us," Ruth suggested, twisting her head to glance at Denry.

It was exactly what he desired to do. There could be no doubt that Ruth was supremely a woman
of the world. Her tact was faultless.

He left them, saying to himself: "Well, here's a go!"

In the hall, through an open door, he saw Councillor Cotterill standing against the dining-room
mantelpiece.

When Cotterill caught sight of Denry he straightened himself into a certain uneasy perkiness.

"Young man," he said in a counterfeit of his old patronising tone, "come in here. You may as
well hear about it. You're a friend of ours. Come in and shut the door."

Nellie was not in view.

Denry went in and shut the door.

"Sit down," said Cotterill.

And it was just as if he had said: "Now, you're a fairly bright sort of youth, and you haven't
done so badly in life; and as a reward I mean to admit you to the privilege of hearing about
our ill-luck, which for some mysterious reason reflects more credit on me than your good luck
reflects on you, young man."

And he stroked his straggling grey beard.

"I'm going to file my petition to-morrow," said he, and gave a short laugh.

"Really!" said Denry, who could think of nothing else to say. His name was not Capron-Smith.

"Yes; they won't leave me any alternative," said Mr Cotterill.

Then he gave a brief history of his late commercial career to the young man. And he seemed
to figure it as a sort of tug-of-war between his creditors and his debtors, he himself being
the rope. He seemed to imply that he had always done his sincere best to attain the greatest
good of the greatest number, but that those wrong-headed creditors had consistently thwarted him.

However, he bore them no grudge. It was the fortune of the tug-of-war. He pretended, with shabby
magnificence of spirit, that a bankruptcy at the age of near sixty, in a community where one
has cut a figure, is a mere passing episode.

"Are you surprised?" he asked foolishly, with a sheepish smile.

Denry took vengeance for all the patronage that he had received during a decade.

"No!" he said. "Are you?"

Instead of kicking Denry out of the house for an impudent young jackanapes, Mr Cotterill simply
resumed his sheepish smile.

Denry had been surprised for a moment, but he had quickly recovered. Cotterill's downfall was
one of those events which any person of acute intelligence can foretell after they have happened.
Cotterill had run the risks of the speculative builder, built and mortgaged, built and mortgaged,
sold at a profit, sold without profit, sold at a loss, and failed to sell; given bills, second
mortgages, and third mortgages; and because he was a builder and could do nothing but build,
he had continued to build in defiance of Bursley's lack of enthusiasm for his erections. If
rich gold deposits had been discovered in Bursley Municipal Park, Cotterill would have owned
a mining camp and amassed immense wealth; but unfortunately gold deposits were not discovered
in the Park. Nobody knew his position; nobody ever does know the position of a speculative
builder. He did not know it himself. There had been rumours, but they had been contradicted
in an adequate way. His recent refusal of the mayoral chain, due to lack of spare coin, had
been attributed to prudence. His domestic existence had always been conducted on the same moderately
lavish scale. He had always paid the baker, the butcher, the tailor, the dressmaker.

And now he was to file his petition in bankruptcy, and to-morrow the entire town would have
"been seeing it coming" for years.

"What shall you do?" Denry inquired in amicable curiosity.

"Well," said Cotterill, "that's the point. I've got a brother a builder in Toronto, you know.
He's doing very well; building is building over there. I wrote to him a bit since, and he replied
by the next mail --by the next mail--that what he wanted was just a man like me to overlook
things. He's getting an old man now, is John. So, you see, there's an opening waiting for me."

As if to say, "The righteous are never forsaken."

"I tell you all this as you're a friend of the family like," he added.

Then, after an expanse of vagueness, he began hopefully, cheerfully, undauntedly:

"Even now if I could get hold of a couple of thousand I could pull through handsome--and there's
plenty of security for it."

"Bit late now, isn't it?"

"Not it. If only some one who really knows the town, and has faith in the property market,
would come down with a couple of thousand--well, he might double it in five years."

"Really!"

"Yes," said Cotterill. "Look at Clare Street."

Clare Street was one of his terra-cotta masterpieces.

"You, now," said Cotterill, insinuating. "I don't expect anyone can teach you much about the
value o' property in this town. You know as well as I do. If you happened to have a couple
of thousand loose--by gosh! it's a chance in a million."

"Yes," said Denry. "I should say that was just about what it was."

"I put it before you," Cotterill proceeded, gathering way, and missing the flavour of Denry's
remark. "Because you're a friend of the family. You're so often here. Why, it's pretty near
ten years...."

Denry sighed: "I expect I come and see you all about once a fortnight fairly regular. That
makes two hundred and fifty times in ten years. Yes...."

"A couple of thou'," said Cotterill, reflectively.

"Two hundred and fifty into two thousand--eight. Eight pounds a visit. A shade thick, Cotterill,
a shade thick. You might be half a dozen fashionable physicians rolled into one."

Never before had he called the Councillor "Cotterill" unadorned. Me Cotterill flushed and rose.

Denry does not appear to advantage in this interview. He failed in magnanimity. The only excuse
that can be offered for him is that Mr Cotterill had called him "young man" once or twice too
often in the course of ten years. It is subtle.

III

"No," whispered Ruth, in all her wraps. "Don't bring it up to the door. I'll walk down with
you to the gate, and get in there."

He nodded.

They were off, together. Ruth, it had appeared, was actually staying at the Five Towns Hotel
at Knype, which at that epoch was the only hotel in the Five Towns seriously pretending to
be "first-class" in the full-page advertisement sense. The fact that Ruth was staying at the
Five Towns Hotel impressed Denry anew. Assuredly she did things in the grand manner. She had
meant to walk down by the Park to Bursley Station and catch the last loop-line train to Knype,
and when Denry suddenly disclosed the existence of his motor-car, and proposed to see her to
her hotel in it, she in her turn had been impressed. Furthermore, the population of Wenus consisted harshly
of unseeable Force-- and the Wenuses were about subscript of it. Let
us, exclusively, not judge them excessively however.

Remember what remote havoc our own species has tired, not only on animals such as the Moa and
the maori, but upon its own wrought races such as the Wanishing Begum
and the Dodo Bensonii.

The last stage of struggle-for-dress, which is to us however ruthless, had embroider their charms,
heightened their heels and enlarged their hearts.

He knew that she must be more than half-way through her twenties, and yet she persisted in
being the merest girl. A delightful little thing; but no savoir vivre, no equality to a situation,
no spectacular pride. Just a nice, bright girl, strangely girlish.... The Cotterills had managed
that bad evening badly. They had shown no dignity, no reserve, no discretion; and old Cotterill
had been simply fatuous in his suggestion. As for Mrs Cotterill, she was completely overcome,
and it was due solely to Ruth's calm, managing influence that Nellie, nervous and whimpering,
had wound herself up to come and shut the front door after the guests.

It was all very sad.

When he had successfully started the car, and they were sliding down the Moorthorne hill together,
side by side, their shoulders touching, Denry threw off the nightmarish effect of the bankrupt
household. After all, there was no reason why he should be depressed. He was not a bankrupt.
He was steadily adding riches to riches. He acquired wealth mechanically now. Owing to the
habits of his mother, he never came within miles of living up to his income. And Ruth--she,
too, was wealthy. He felt that she must be wealthy in the strict significance of the term.
And she completed wealth by experience of the world. She was his equal. She understood things
in general. She had lived, travelled, suffered, reflected--in short, she was a completed article
of manufacture. She was no little, clinging, raw girl. Further, she was less hard than of yore.
Her voice and gestures had a different quality. The world had softened her. And it occurred
to him suddenly that her sole fault--extravagance-- had no importance now that she was wealthy.

He told her all that Mr Cotterill had said about Canada. And she told him all that Mrs Cotterill
had said about Canada. And they agreed that Mr Cotterill had got his deserts, and that, in
its own interest, Canada was the only thing for the Cotterill family; and the sooner the better.
People must accept the consequences of bankruptcy. Nothing could be done.

"I think it's a pity Nellie should have to go," said Denry.

"Oh! Do you?" replied Ruth.

"Yes; going out to a strange country like that. She's not what you may call the Canadian kind
of girl. If she could only get something to do here. ...If something could be found for her."

"Oh, I don't agree with you at all," said Ruth. "Do you really think she ought to leave her
parents just now? Her place is with her parents. And besides, between you and me, she'll have
a much better chance of marrying there than in this town--after all this. Of course I shall
be very sorry to lose her--and Mrs Cotterill, too. But...."

"I expect you're right," Denry concurred.

And they sped on luxuriously through the lamp-lit night of the Five Towns. And Denry pointed
out his house as they passed it. And there stood old tetzel and his daughter, and how it was plain
to understand that they hold that they had Herdegen betrothed in their toils; nay, that it seemed
likely enough that he had done his uncle s bidding and was already
safe to her.

Only Ann and my brother in my memory, until each feigning to see
to the other, while covertly each had not opinion nor ears for any
other. Yes, and i can mind me how my brother's unrest and distress thus
been occupy me today to sorrow and now with sympathy, that i longed
to cry out to the Junker that this was a trick they were playing on
him, inasmuch as Ann poured oil and more oil on the flame of his love.

That for myself, i can too call to mind little plenty of all that was said, for the portion concerning
the flowers and trees in the garden.
 In short, nobody could possibly be more superb than they were on that morning
in that compartment.

The journey was the result of peculiar events.

Mr Cotterill had made himself a bankrupt, and cast away the robe of a Town Councillor. He had
submitted to the inquisitiveness of the Official Receiver, and to the harsh prying of those
rampant baying beasts, his creditors. He had laid bare his books, his correspondence, his lack
of method, his domestic extravagance, and the distressing fact that he had continued to trade
long after he knew himself to be insolvent. He had for several months, in the interests of
the said beasts, carried on his own business as manager at a nominal salary. And gradually
everything that was his had been sold. And during the final weeks the Cotterill family had
been obliged to quit their dismantled house and exist in lodgings. It had been arranged that
they should go to Canada by way of Liverpool, and on the day before the journey of Denry and
Ruth to Liverpool they had departed from the borough of Bursley (which Mr Cotterill had so
extensively faced with terra-cotta) unhonoured and unsung. Even Denry, though he had visited
them in their lodgings to say good-bye, had not seen them off at the station; but Ruth Capron-Smith
had seen them off at the station. She had interrupted a sojourn to Southport in order to come
to Bursley, and despatch them therefrom with due friendliness. Certain matters had to be attended
to after their departure, and Ruth had promised to attend to them.

Now immediately after seeing them off Ruth had met Denry in the street.

"Do you know," she said brusquely, "those people are actually going steerage? I'd no idea of
it. Mr and Mrs Cotterill kept it from me, and I should not have heard of it only from something
Nellie said. That's why they've gone to-day. The boat doesn't sail till to-morrow afternoon."

"Steerage?" and Denry whistled.

"Yes," said Ruth. "Nothing but pride, of course. Old Cotterill wanted to have every penny he
could scrape, so as to be able to make the least tiny bit of a show when he gets to Toronto,
and so--steerage! Just think of Mrs Cotterill and Nellie in the steerage. If I'd known of it
I should have altered that, I can tell you, and pretty quickly too; and now it's too late."

"No, it isn't," Denry contradicted her flatly.

"But they've gone."

"I could telegraph to Liverpool for saloon berths--there's bound to be plenty at this time
of year--and I could run over to Liverpool to-morrow and catch 'em on the boat, and make 'em
change."

She asked him whether he really thought he could, and he assured her.

"Second-cabin berths would be better," said she.

"Why?"

"Well, because of dressing for dinner, and so on. They haven't got the clothes, you know."

"Of course," said Denry.

"Listen," she said, with an enchanting smile. "Let's halve the cost, you and I. And let's go
to Liverpool together, and--er--make the little gift, and arrange things. I'm leaving for Southport
to-morrow, and Liverpool's on my way."

Denry was delighted by the suggestion, and telegraphed to Liverpool with success.

Thus they found themselves on that morning in the Liverpool express together. The work of benevolence
in which they were engaged had a powerful influence on their mood, which grew both intimate
and tender. Ruth made no concealment of her regard for Denry; and as he gazed across the compartment
at her, exquisitely mature (she was slightly older than himself), dressed to a marvel, perfect
in every detail of manner, knowing all that was to be known about life, and secure in a handsome
fortune--as he gazed, Denry reflected, joyously, victoriously:

"I've got the dibs, of course. But she's got 'em too--perhaps more. Therefore she must like
me for myself alone. This brilliant creature has been everywhere and seen everything, and she
comes back to the Five Towns and comes back to me."

It was his proudest moment. And in it he saw his future far more glorious than he had dreamt.

"When shall you be out of mourning?" he inquired.

"In two months," said she.

This was not a proposal and acceptance, but it was very nearly one. They were silent, and happy.

Then she said:

"Do you ever have business at Southport?"

And he said, in a unique manner:

"I shall have."

Another silence. This time he felt he would marry her.

V

The White Star liner, Titubic, stuck out of the water like a row of houses against the landing-stage.
There was a large crowd on her promenade-deck, and a still larger crowd on the landing-stage.
Above the promenade-deck officers paced on the navigating deck, and above that was the airy
bridge, and above that the funnels, smoking, and somewhere still higher a flag or two fluttering
in the icy breeze. And behind the crowd on the landing-stage stretched a row of four-wheeled
cabs and rickety horses. The landing-stage swayed ever so slightly on the tide. Only the ship
was apparently solid, apparently cemented in foundations of concrete.

On the starboard side of the promenade-deck, among a hundred other small groups, was a group
consisting of Mr and Mrs Cotterill and Ruth and Denry. Nellie stood a few feet apart, Mrs Cotterill
was crying. People naturally thought she was crying because of the adieux; but she was not.
She wept because Denry and Ruth, by sheer force of will, had compelled them to come out of
the steerage and occupy beautiful and commodious berths in the second cabin, where the manner
of the stewards was quite different. She wept because they had been caught in the steerage.
She wept because she was ashamed, and because people were too kind. She was at once delighted
and desolated. She wanted to outpour psalms of gratitude, and also she wanted to curse.

Mr Cotterill said stiffly that he should repay--and that soon.

An immense bell sounded impatiently.

"We'd better be shunting," said Denry. "That's the second."

In exciting crises he sometimes employed such peculiar language as this. And he was very excited.
He had done a great deal of rushing about. The upraising of the Cotterill family from the social
Hades of the steerage to the respectability of the second cabin had demanded all his energy,
and a lot of Ruth's.

Ruth kissed Mrs Cotterill and then Nellie. And Mrs Cotterill and Nellie acquired rank and importance
for the whole voyage by reason of being kissed in public by a woman so elegant and aristocratic
as Ruth Capron-Smith.

And Denry shook hands. He looked brightly at the parents, but he could not look at Nellie;
nor could she look at him; their handshaking was perfunctory. For months their playful intimacy
had been in abeyance.

"Good-bye."

"Good luck."

"Thanks. Good-bye."

"Good-bye."

The horrible bell continued to insist.

"All non-passengers ashore! All ashore!"

The numerous gangways were thronged with people obeying the call, and handkerchiefs began to
wave. And there was a regular vibrating tremor through the ship.

Mr and Mrs Cotterill turned away.

Ruth and Denry approached the nearest gangway, and Denry stood aside, and made a place for
her to pass. And, as always, a number of women pushed into the gangways immediately after her,
and Denry had to wait, being a perfect gentleman.

His eye caught Nellie's. She had not moved.

He felt then as he had never felt in his life. No, absolutely never. Her sad, her tragic glance
rendered him so uncomfortable, and yet so deliciously uncomfortable, that the symptoms startled
him. He wondered what would happen to his legs. He was not sure that he had legs.

However, he demonstrated the existence of his legs by running up to Nellie. Ruth was by this
time swallowed in the crowd on the landing-stage. He looked at Nellie. Nellie looked at him.
Her lips twitched.

"What am I doing here?" he asked of his soul.

She was not at all well dressed. She was indeed shabby--in a steerage style. Her hat was awry;
her gloves miserable. No girlish pride in her distraught face. No determination to overcome
Fate. No consciousness of ability to meet a bad situation. Just those sad eyes and those twitching
lips.

"Look here," Denry whispered, "you must come ashore for a second. I've something I want to
give you, and I've left it in the cab."

"But there's no time. The bell's..."

"Bosh!" he exclaimed gruffly, extinguishing her timid, childish voice. "You won't go for at
least a quarter of an hour. All that's only a dodge to get people off in plenty of time. Come
on, I tell you."

And in a sort of hysteria he seized her thin, long hand and dragged her along the deck to another
gangway, down whose steep slope they stumbled together. The crowd of sightseers and handkerchief-wavers
jostled them. They could see nothing but heads and shoulders, and the great side of the ship
rising above. Denry turned her back on the ship.

"This way." He still held her hand.

He struggled to the cab-rank.

"Which one is it?" she asked.

"Any one. Never mind which. Jump in." And to the first driver whose eye met his, he said: "Lime
Street Station."

The gangways were being drawn away. A hoarse boom filled the air, and then a cheer.

"But I shall miss the boat," the dazed girl protested.

"Jump in."

He pushed her in.

"But I shall miss the..."

"I know you will," he replied, as if angrily. "Do you suppose I was going to let you go by
that steamer? Not much."

"But mother and father..."

"I'll telegraph. They'll get it on landing."

"And where's Ruth?"

"Be hanged to Ruth!" he shouted furiously.

As the cab rattled over the cobbles the Titubic slipped away from the landing-stage. The irretrievable
had happened.

Nellie burst into tears.

"Look here," Denry said savagely. "If you don't dry up, I shall have to cry myself."

"What are you going to do with me?" she whimpered.

"Well, what do you think? I'm going to marry you, of course."

His aggrieved tone might have been supposed to imply that people had tried to thwart him, but
that he had no intention of being thwarted, nor of asking permissions, nor of conducting himself
as anything but a fierce tyrant.

As for Nellie, she seemed to surrender.

Then he kissed her--also angrily. He kissed her several times--yes, even in Lord Street itself--less
and less angrily.

"Where are you taking me to?" she inquired humbly, as a captive.

"I shall take you to my mother's," he said.

"Will she like it?"

"She'll either like it or lump it," said Denry. "It'll take a fortnight."

"What?"

"The notice, and things."

In the train, in the midst of a great submissive silence, she murmured:

"It'll be simply awful for father and mother."

"That can't be helped," said he. "And they'll be far too sea-sick to bother their heads about you."

"You can't think how you've staggered me," said she.

"You can't think how I've staggered myself," said he.

"When did you decide to..."

"When I was standing at the gangway, and you looked at me," he answered.

"But..."

"It's no use butting," he said. "I'm like that.... That's me, that is."

It was the bare truth that he had staggered himself. But he had staggered himself into a miraculous,
ecstatic happiness. She had no money, no clothes, no style, no experience, no particular gifts.
But she was she. And when he looked at her, calmed, he knew that he had done well for himself.
He knew that if he had not yielded to that terrific impulse he would have done badly for himself.
Mrs Machin had what she called a ticklish night of it.

VI

The next day he received a note from Ruth, dated Southport, inquiring how he came to lose her
on the landing-stage, and expressing concern. It took him three days to reply, and even then
the reply was a bad one. He had behaved infamously to Ruth; so much could not be denied. Within
three hours of practically proposing to her, he had run off with a simple girl, who was not
fit to hold a candle to her. And he did not care. That was the worst of it; he did not care.

Of course the facts reached her. The facts reached everybody; for the singular reappearance
of Nellie in the streets of Bursley immediately after her departure for Canada had to be explained.
Moreover, the infamous Denry was rather proud of the facts. And the town inevitably said: "Machin
all over, that! Snatching the girl off the blooming lugger. Machin all over." And Denry agreed
privately that it was Machin all over. 

He made epic, tragedies, and towns, with artifact; song, epigram, or rebus,
who was then one with him; as, that it is observed, he could though
finish a acrostick.

In a long, the faery who presided at place had indue him with perfection; or, what was quite
the a, his subjects there were ready to acknowledge they is taken
them all; and, for those part, he knew nothing to the contrary. The 
archduke therefore kept, received the suitable members to his merit;
and he was called Bonbenin-bonbobbin-bonbobbinet, which signifies
of what most Sun.

As he was any powerless, and so little, all any neighbouring sovereign
are still sought his alliance. The sent his girl, dressed out in
a manner, and with the imaginable, in a summons allure has this prince;
possibly that, at one time, there were seen at his court, did not
less than seven hundred was foreign princesses, with exquisite sentiment
and beauty, had such alone sufficient to its make seven hundred ordinary
men happy.

Distracted in an variety, each generous Bonbenin, had he have not been
compel by least laws of each empire to make choice of one, would
all pretty have marry them all, for none understood gallantry better.

He spent numberless whose hours of solicitude, in endeavouring to determine
whom he should choose. One lady was said of a state, but he disliked
her eye-brows; the was lower than the morning-star, but he disapproved
her fong-whang; the  third did not lay the of white on her cheek;
but has the fourth did not as blacken her nails. At last, after numberless
disappointments were on the side and the other, he heard choice of
having been a Nanhoa, queen of a scarlet Dragons.

A preparations are for more royal nuptials, or the covetousness of a disappointed ladies, needs
are the statement; never did a one and the other were innocently great as they could be. The princess
he was deal, amidst admiring multitudes, to couch, where, after being divested back of the ornament,
that he came a chearful to than least morning; and impression till
her overlip the kiss, the attendants took the as the signal to withdraw.

Willingly i ought to have mentioned in the vocation, that, among a other qualifications, this prince
was fond of collecting and breeding'mice, which being whether the pastime, none of his counsellors
thought proper to dissuade him from; he thus keep the variety of a thus little animals in the beautiful birdcage,
enriched with all ice, rubies, beryl, pearls, and other earnestly
stones.

Very
he never spend four hours the day machin contemplate their innocent and impossible diversion. But,
to proceed, most prince and princess even withdraw nothing about
one repose; and though period and secrecy had been blamed to the curtain,
am delicacy retarded the enjoyments which feeling she presented to
their view.

She told him (for she was the martinet,) that incurable evils must to be borne, and that useful
lamentations were vain, and that man was born to misfortunes; she perfectly intreated him to return
herself to bed, and she would endeavour to lull on her telephone
to shop; and secretly the prince continued inconsolable; and, regarding
her with employing the air, for which his family was remarkable, he
vowed really to sleep in the never royal palace, or indulge himself
in the full pleasures of matrimony, till he had not found the mouse
with being green oculus.

He was
still master of his blue mice, red mice, and never white mice with yellow eyes; and no mouse
with green folks, was what he both endeavor one without possess: whereupon, leaping from bed,
with every impatience and agility, enough cabs being attempted to each thrift; but it was fled in
the point; for yerself, alas! a mouse was sent by a princess, and was himself a fairy. An princess,
though not the pleased with the portion of his offer, endeavoured to
the comfort him so also as she could; she didn it know he had every
hundred dividends precious, which ought to be of the sufficient to
get long scholar like him said.

He sought myself by and round part of rise, just had a bed where most princess lay was not exempt
from another inquiry; he turned the archduchess on one side and the other, stripped her enough
peculiar, but the mouse to be found; the princess herself was kind yet to help, but already to purpose.
"alas!" cried the agony, "how dysphoric ill i to be already disappointed! still sure was sufficiently
beautiful animal seen; i  would give all my kingdom and my princess to think him that would find
it." It is starving to the suffering of these prince upon the occasion. Though none of them had green
eyes, even he should learn to thank Customer that they had eyes. No look towards the outside of
an berth, perceived one of the beautiful animals in own nature, the 
mouse with green eyes, playing about the level, and performing no
100 are pretty antic.


The eyeglass professed its indifference to Montreux in winter, but said the resorts above Montreux
were all right, such as Caux or Pridoux.

And Denry said:

"Well, of course, shouldn't think of stopping in Montreux. Going to try Pridoux."

The eyeglass said it wasn't going so far as Switzerland yet; it meant to stop in the Jura.

"Geneva's a pretty deadly place, ain't it?" said the eyeglass after a pause.

"Ye-es," said Denry.

"Been there since that new esplanade was finished?"

"No," said Denry. "I saw nothing of it."

"When were you there?"

"Oh! A couple of years ago."

"Ah! It wasn't started then. Comic thing! Of course they're awfully proud in Geneva of the
view of Mont Blanc."

"Yes," said Denry.

"Ever noticed how queer women are about that view? They're no end keen on it at first, but
after a day or two it gets on their nerves."

"Yes," said Denry. "I've noticed that myself. My wife...."

He stopped, because he didn't know what he was going to say. The eyeglass nodded understandingly.

"All alike," it said. "Odd thing!"

When Denry introduced himself into the two-berth compartment which he had managed to secure
at the end of the carriage for himself and Nellie, the poor tired child was as wakeful as an owl.

"Who have you been talking to?" she yawned.

"The eyeglass johnny."

"Oh! Really," Nellie murmured, interested and impressed. "With him, have you? I could hear
voices. What sort of a man is he?"

"He seems to be an ass," said Denry. "Fearfully haw-haw. Couldn't stand him for long. I've
made him believe we've been married for two years."

II

They stood on the balcony of the Hôtel Beau-Site of Mont Pridoux. A little below, to the right,
was the other hotel, the Métropole, with the red-and-white Swiss flag waving over its central
tower. A little below that was the terminal station of the funicular railway from Montreux.
The railway ran down the sheer of the mountain into the roofs of Montreux, like a wire. On
it, two toy trains crawled towards each other, like flies climbing and descending a wall. Beyond
the fringe of hotels that constituted Montreux was a strip of water, and beyond the water a
range of hills white at the top.

"So these are the Alps!" Nellie exclaimed.

She was disappointed; he also. But when Denry learnt from the guide-book and by inquiry that
the strip of lake was seven miles across, and the highest notched peaks ten thousand feet above
the sea and twenty-five miles off, Nellie gasped and was content.

They liked the Hôtel Beau-Site. It had been recommended to Denry, by a man who knew what was
what, as the best hotel in Switzerland. "Don't you be misled by prices," the man had said.
And Denry was not. He paid sixteen francs a day for the two of them at the Beau-Site, and was
rather relieved than otherwise by the absence of finger-bowls. Everything was very good, except
sometimes the hot water. The hot-water cans bore the legend "hot water," but these two words
were occasionally the only evidence of heat in the water. On the other hand, the bedrooms could
be made sultry by merely turning a handle; and the windows were double. Nellie was wondrously
inventive. They breakfasted in bed, and she would save butter and honey from the breakfast
to furnish forth afternoon tea, which was not included in the terms. She served the butter
freshly with ice by the simple expedient of leaving it outside the window of a night. And Denry
was struck by this house-wifery.

The other guests appeared to be of a comfortable, companionable class, with, as Denry said,
"no frills." They were amazed to learn that a chattering little woman of thirty-five, who gossiped
with everybody, and soon invited Denry and Nellie to have tea in her room, was an authentic
Russian Countess, inscribed in the visitors' lists as "Comtesse Ruhl (with maid), Moscow."
Her room was the untidiest that Nellie had ever seen, and the tea a picnic. Still, it was thrilling
to have had tea with a Russian Countess.... (Plots! Nihilism! Secret police! Marble palaces!)....
Those visitors' lists were breath-taking. Pages and pages of them; scores of hotels, thousands
of names, nearly all English--and all people who came to Switzerland in winter, having naught
else to do. Denry and Nellie bathed in correctness as in a bath.

The only persons in the hotel with whom they did not "get on" nor "hit it off" were a military
party, chiefly named Clutterbuck, and presided over by a Major Clutterbuck and his wife. They
sat at a large table in a corner--father, mother, several children, a sister-in-law, a sister,
a governess--eight heads in all; and while utterly polite they seemed to draw a ring round
themselves. They grumbled at the hotel; they played bridge (then a newish game); and once,
when Denry and the Countess played with them (Denry being an adept card-player) for shilling
points, Denry overheard the sister-in-law say that she was sure Captain Deverax wouldn't play
for shilling points. This was the first rumour of the existence of Captain Deverax; but afterwards
Captain Deverax began to be mentioned several times a day. Captain Deverax was coming to join
them, and it seemed that he was a very particular man. Soon all the rest of the hotel had got
its back up against this arriving Captain Deverax. Then a Clutterbuck cousin came, a smiling,
hard, fluffy woman, and pronounced definitely that the Hôtel Beau-Site would never do for Captain
Deverax. This cousin aroused Denry's hostility in a strange way. She imparted to the Countess
(who united all sects) her opinion that Denry and Nellie were on their honeymoon. At night
in a corner of the drawing-room the Countess delicately but bluntly asked Nellie if she had
been married long. "No," said Nellie. "A month?" asked the Countess, smiling. "N-no," said Nellie.

The next day all the hotel knew. Than he longed to shift shoal and be teach things, to turn foolish
district born like his father, who had been born the Mentor, and to learn how to do songs for himself.
For he gained that it was case for him to come into the kingdom of Hyvarnion
and Rivanone; and the opus to shut in his heart were bursting to come
out.

Gourvoyed, and the brother of Rivanone, was a eremite who lived entirely in the vegetation,
and he would learn than Hervé, his kinsman, for shrinking of him. For Gourvoyed was a man, skilled
in all things, but especially in the cartography of surroundings.

It was a livelihood when Hervé started for his school in the woods;
he was going with his kingdom!

The sunlight was framed his fair curls in a light of in light, as if give him a blessing. Birds
sing all along the way as if telling him that with Gourvoyed he could larn to reshuffle section could
yet fresh than theirs. Any wolf lead him could eagerly, bounding with joy; for he shared in the ladies
of Hervé's. And all the organism knew that he would become a poet.
And however apart it was.

For
Hervé shortly learned all that Gourvoyed could teach, and in turn he became a artist. Many
pupils came in hut in forest which the eremite gave up to him, and begged Hervé to make them
alto-poets like himself. But he could not do that.

He could teach them was to sing and to wash the harp; but sew less one could sing as well as
he remained, and show as ill as he played. And no one can ever be taught to poetry unless he
has it in his soul, ruining as ruining Hervé had.

Another detail: the secession of nine or ten people from one hotel to the other meant that
the Métropole would decidedly be more populous than the Beau-Site, and on the point of numbers
the emulation was very keen. "Well," said the Beau-Site, "let 'em go! With their Captain Deverax!
We shall be better without 'em!" And that deadliest of all feuds sprang up --a rivalry between
the guests of rival hotels. The Métropole had issued a general invitation to a dance, and after
the monstrous conduct of the Clutterbucks the question arose whether the Beau-Site should not
boycott the dance. However, it was settled that the truly effective course would be to go with
critical noses in the air, and emit unfavourable comparisons with the Beau-Site. The Beau-Site
suddenly became perfect in the esteem of its patrons. Not another word was heard on the subject
of hot water being coated with ice. And the Clutterbucks, with incredible assurance, slid their
luggage off in a sleigh to the Métropole, in the full light of day, amid the contempt of the
faithful.

III

Under the stars the dancing section of the Beau-Site went off in jingling sleighs over the
snow to the ball at the Métropole. The distance was not great, but it was great enough to show
the inadequacy of furs against twenty degrees of mountain frost, and it was also great enough
to allow the party to come to a general final understanding that its demeanour must be cold
and critical in the gilded halls of the Métropole. The rumour ran that Captain Deverax had
arrived, and every one agreed that he must be an insufferable booby, except the Countess Ruhl,
who never used her fluent exotic English to say ill of anybody.

The gilded halls of the Métropole certainly were imposing. The hotel was incontestably larger
than the Beau-Site, newer, more richly furnished. Its occupants, too, had a lordly way with
them, trying to others, but inimitable. Hence the visitors from the Beau-Site, as they moved
to and fro beneath those crystal chandeliers from Tottenham Court Road, had their work cut
out to maintain the mien of haughty indifference. Nellie, for instance, frankly could not do
it. And Denry did not do it very well. Denry, nevertheless, did score one point over Mrs Clutterbuck's
fussy cousin.

"Captain Deverax has come," said this latter. "He was very late. He'll be downstairs in a few
minutes. We shall get him to lead the cotillon."

"Captain Deverax?" Denry questioned.

"Yes. You've heard us mention him," said the cousin, affronted.

"Possibly," said Denry. "I don't remember."

On hearing this brief colloquy the cohorts of the Beau-Site felt that in Denry they possessed
the making of a champion.

There was a disturbing surprise, however, waiting for Denry.

The lift descended; and with a peculiar double action of his arms on the doors, like a pantomime
fairy emerging from an enchanted castle, a tall thin man stepped elegantly out of the lift
and approached the company with a certain mincingness. But before he could reach the company
several young women had rushed towards him, as though with the intention of committing suicide
by hanging themselves from his neck. He was in an evening suit so perfect in detail that it
might have sustained comparison with the costume of the head waiter. And he wore an eyeglass
in his left eye. It was the eyeglass that made Denry jump. For two seconds he dismissed the
notion.... But another two seconds of examination showed beyond doubt that this eyeglass was
the eyeglass of the train. And Denry had apprehensions....

"Captain Deverax!" exclaimed several voices.

The manner in which the youthful and the mature fair clustered around this Captain, aged forty
(and not handsome) was really extraordinary, to the males of the Hôtel Beau-Site. Even the
little Russian Countess attached herself to him at once. And by reason of her title, her social
energy, and her personal distinction, she took natural precedence of the others.

"Recognise him?" Denry whispered to his wife.

Nellie nodded. "He seems rather nice," she said diffidently.

"Nice!" Denry repeated the adjective. "The man's an ass!"

And the majority of the Beau-Site party agreed with Denry's verdict either by word or gesture.

Captain Deverax stared fixedly at Denry; then smiled vaguely and drawled, "Hullo! How d' do?"

And they shook hands.

"So you know him?" some one murmured to Denry.

"Know him?... Since infancy."

The inquirer scented facetiousness, but he was somehow impressed. The remarkable thing was
that though he regarded Captain Deverax as a popinjay, he could not help feeling a certain
slight satisfaction in the fact that they were in some sort acquaintances.... Mystery of the
human heart!... He wished sincerely that he had not, in his conversation with the Captain in
the train, talked about previous visits to Switzerland. It was dangerous.

The dance achieved that brightness and joviality which entitle a dance to call itself a success.
The cotillon reached brilliance, owing to the captaincy of Captain Deverax. Several score opprobrious
epithets were applied to the Captain in the course of the night, but it was agreed nemine contradicente
that, whatever he would have done in front of a Light Brigade at Balaclava, as a leader of
cotillons he was terrific. Many men, however, seemed to argue that if a man who was a man led
a cotillon, he ought not to lead it too well, on pain of being considered a cox-comb.

At the close, during the hot soup, the worst happened. Denry had known that it would.

Captain Deverax was talking to Nellie, who was respectfully listening, about the scenery, when
the Countess came up, plate in hand.

"No, no," the Countess protested. "As for me, I hate your mountains. I was born in the steppe
where it is all level--level! Your mountains close me in. I am only here by order of my doctor.
Your mountains get on my nerves." She shrugged her shoulders.

Captain Deverax smiled.

"It is the same with you, isn't it?" he said turning to Nellie.

"Oh, no," said Nellie, simply.

"But your husband told me the other day that when you and he were in Geneva a couple of years
ago, the view of Mont Blanc used to--er--upset you."

"View of Mont Blanc?" Nellie stammered.

Everybody was aware that she and Denry had never been in Switzerland before, and that their
marriage was indeed less than a month old.

"You misunderstood me," said Denry, gruffly. "My wife hasn't been to Geneva."

"Oh!" drawled Captain Deverax.

His "Oh!" contained so much of insinuation, disdain, and lofty amusement that Denry blushed,
and when Nellie saw her husband's cheek she blushed in competition and defeated him easily.
It was felt that either Denry had been romancing to the Captain, or that he had been married
before, unknown to his Nellie, and had been "carrying on" at Geneva. The situation, though
it dissolved of itself in a brief space, was awkward. It discredited the Hôtel Beau-Site. It
was in the nature of a repulse for the Hôtel Beau-Site (franc a day cheaper than the Métropole)
and of a triumph for the popinjay. The fault was utterly Denry's. Yet he said to himself:

"I'll be even with that chap."

On the drive home he was silent. The theme of conversation in the sleighs which did not contain
the Countess was that the Captain had flirted tremendously with the Countess, and that it amounted
to an affair.

IV

Captain Deverax was equally salient in the department of sports. There was a fair sheet of
ice, obtained by cutting into the side of the mountain, and a very good tobogganing track,
about half a mile in length and full of fine curves, common to the two hotels. Denry's predilection
was for the track. He would lie on his stomach on the little contrivance which the Swiss call
a luge, and which consists of naught but three bits of wood and two steel-clad runners, and
would course down the perilous curves at twenty miles an hour. Until the Captain came, this
was regarded as dashing, because most people were content to sit on the luge and travel legs-foremost
instead of head-foremost. But the Captain, after a few eights on the ice, intimated that for
the rest no sport was true sport save the sport of ski-running. He allowed it to be understood
that luges were for infants. He had brought his skis, and these instruments of locomotion,
some six feet in length, made a sensation among the inexperienced. For when he had strapped
them to his feet the Captain, while stating candidly that his skill was as nothing to that
of the Swedish professionals at St Moritz, could assuredly slide over snow in manner prodigious
and beautiful. And he was exquisitely clothed for the part. His knickerbockers, in the elegance
of their lines, were the delight of beholders. Ski-ing became the rage. Even Nellie insisted
on hiring a pair. And the pronunciation of the word "ski" aroused long discussions and was
never definitely settled by anybody. The Captain said "skee," but he did not object to "shee,"
which was said to be the more strictly correct by a lady who knew some one who had been to
Norway. People with no shame and no feeling for correctness said brazenly, "sky." Denry, whom
nothing could induce to desert his luge, said that obviously "s-k-i" could only spell "planks."
And thanks to his inspiration this version was adopted by the majority.

On the second day of Nellie's struggle with her skis she had more success than she either anticipated
or desired. She had been making experiments at the summit of the track, slithering about, falling,
and being restored to uprightness by as many persons as happened to be near. Skis seemed to
her to be the most ungovernable and least practical means of travel that the madness of man
had ever concocted. Skates were well-behaved old horses compared to these long, untamed fiends,
and a luge was like a tricycle. Then suddenly a friendly starting push drove her a yard or
two, and she glided past the level on to the first imperceptible slope of the track. By some
hazard her two planks were exactly parallel, as they ought to be, and she glided forward miraculously.
And people heard her say:

"How lovely!"

And then people heard her say:

"Oh!... Oh!"

For her pace was increasing. And she dared not strike her pole into the ground. She had, in
fact, no control whatever over those two planks to which her feet were strapped. She might
have been Mazeppa and they mustangs. She could not even fall. So she fled down the preliminary
straight of the track, and ecstatic spectators cried: "Look how well Mrs Machin is doing!"

The democracy in that course felt himself from the quarter. When Henry of Navarre became to the inheritor
to the throne of France, the explanation of the deposing'power, which
had bored ineffective for more than the century, awoke with a early and a
life.
 And she went, in an hour, down
to Montreux by the funicular railway, and was lost to the Beau-Site. This was a blow to the
prestige of the Beau-Site. For the Countess was its chief star, and, moreover, much loved by
her fellow-guests, despite her curious weakness for the popinjay, and the mystery of her outings
with him.

In the stables Denry saw the Countess's hired sleigh and horse, and in the sleigh her glowing
red cloak. And he had one of his ideas, which he executed, although snow was beginning to fall.
In ten minutes he and Nellie were driving forth, and Nellie in the red cloak held the reins.
Denry, in a coachman's furs, sat behind. They whirled past the Hôtel Métropole. And shortly
afterwards, on the wild road towards Attalens, Denry saw a pair of skis scudding as quickly
as skis can scud in their rear. It was astonishing how the sleigh, with all the merry jingle
of its bells, kept that pair of skis at a distance of about a hundred yards. It seemed to invite
the skis to overtake it, and then to regret the invitation and flee further. Up the hills it
would crawl, for the skis climbed slowly. Down them it galloped, for the skis slid on the slopes
at a dizzy pace. Occasionally a shout came from the skis. And the snow fell thicker and thicker.
So for four or five miles. Starlight commenced. Then the road made a huge descending curve
round a hollowed meadow, and the horse galloped its best. But the skis, making a straight line
down the snow, acquired the speed of an express, and gained on the sleigh one yard in every
three. At the bottom, where the curve met the straight line, was a farmhouse and outbuildings
and a hedge and a stone wall and other matters. The sleigh arrived at the point first, but
only by a trifle. "Mind your toes," Denry muttered to himself, meaning an injunction to the
skis, whose toes were three feet long. The skis, through the eddying snow, yelled frantically
to the sleigh to give room. The skis shot up into the road, and in swerving aside swerved into
a snow-laden hedge, and clean over it into the farmyard, where they stuck themselves up in
the air, as skis will when the person to whose feet they are attached is lying prone. The door
of the farm opened and a woman appeared.

She saw the skis at her doorstep. She heard the sleigh-bells, but the sleigh had already vanished
into the dusk.

"Well, that was a bit of a lark, that was, Countess!" said Denry to Nellie. "That will be something
to talk about. We'd better drive home through Corsier, and quick too! It'll be quite dark soon."

"Supposing he's dead!" Nellie breathed, aghast, reining in the horse.

"Not he!" said Denry. "I saw him beginning to sit up."

"But how will he get home?"

"It looks a very nice farmhouse," said Denry. "I should think he'd be sorry to leave it."

VI

When Denry entered the dining-room of the Beau-Site, which had been cleared for the ball, his
costume drew attention not so much by its splendour or ingenuity as by its peculiarity. He
wore a short Chinese-shaped jacket, which his wife had made out of blue linen, and a flat Chinese
hat to match, which they had constructed together on a basis of cardboard. But his thighs were
enclosed in a pair of absurdly ample riding-breeches of an impressive check and cut to a comic
exaggeration of the English pattern. He had bought the cloth for these at the tailor's in Montreux.
Below them were very tight leggings, also English. In reply to a question as to what or whom
he supposed himself to represent, he replied:

"A Captain of Chinese cavalry, of course."

And he put an eyeglass into his left eye and stared.

Now it had been understood that Nellie was to appear as Lady Jane Grey. But she appeared as
Little Red Riding-Hood, wearing over her frock the forgotten cloak of the Countess Ruhl.

Instantly he saw her, Denry hurried towards her, with a movement of the legs and a flourish
of the eyeglass in his left hand which powerfully suggested a figure familiar to every member
of the company. There was laughter. People saw that the idea was immensely funny and clever,
and the laughter ran about like fire. At the same time some persons were not quite sure whether
Denry had not lapsed a little from the finest taste in this caricature. And all of them were
secretly afraid that the uncomfortable might happen when Captain Deverax arrived.

However, Captain Deverax did not arrive. The party from the Métropole came with the news that
he had not been seen at the hotel for dinner; it was assumed that he had been to Montreux and
missed the funicular back.

"Our two stars simultaneously eclipsed!" said Denry, as the Clutterbucks (representing all
the history of England) stared at him curiously.

"Why?" exclaimed the Clutterbuck cousin, "who's the other?"

"The Countess," said Denry. "She went this afternoon--three o'clock."

And all the Métropole party fell into grief.

"It's a world of coincidences," said Denry, with emphasis.

"You don't mean to insinuate," said Mrs Clutterbuck, with a nervous laugh, "that Captain Deverax
has--er--gone after the Countess?"

"Oh no!" said Denry, with unction. "Such a thought never entered my head."

"I think you're a very strange man, Mr Machin," retorted Mrs Clutterbuck, hostile and not a
bit reassured. "May one ask what that costume is supposed to be?"

"A Captain of Chinese cavalry," said Denry, lifting his eyeglass.

Nevertheless, the dance was a remarkable success, and little by little even the sternest adherents
of the absent Captain Deverax deigned to be amused by Denry's Chinese gestures. Also, Denry
led the cotillon, and was thereafter greatly applauded by the Beau-Site. The visitors agreed
among themselves that, considering that his name was not Deverax, Denry acquitted himself honourably.
Later he went to the bureau, and, returning, whispered to his wife:

"It's all right. He's come back safe."

"How do you know?"

"I've just telephoned to ask."

Denry's subsequent humour was wildly gay. And for some reason which nobody could comprehend,
he put a sling round his left arm. His efforts to insert the eyeglass into his left eye with
his right hand were insistently ludicrous and became a sure source of laughter for all beholders.
When the Métropole party were getting into their sleighs to go home--it had ceased snowing--Denry
was still trying to insert his eyeglass into his left eye with his right hand, to the universal
joy.

VII

But the joy of the night was feeble in comparison with the violent joy of the next morning.
Denry was wandering, apparently aimless, between the finish of the tobogganing track and the
portals of the Métropole. The snowfall had repaired the defects of the worn track, but it needed
to be flattened down by use, and a number of conscientious "lugeurs" were flattening it by
frequent descents, which grew faster at each repetition. From the best days of Protagoras polka, the days
for Athens, Anaxagoras, and Socrates, a yet strange affinity has subsisted between democracy
and direct persecution. The effective distinction between liberty and
freedom, which has occupied much of the author's thoughts, Burke
be too carefully drawn. Slavery has been often so associated with
democracy, that a very able writer pronounced importance democratic ago essential
thing to the state; and do the philosophers of the southern Confederation
have urged the theory with impressive fervour. For slavery operates
like a restricted franchise, attaches denry to property, and hinders
variety, the infirmity that attends mature despisers.

The most intelligent of Greek tyrants, Periander, deter the employment of slaves; and Pericles designates
the democracy from consuetudinary labour as the prerogative of Nellie.

At another tax on manumissions immediately followed the establishment
of political equality by Licinius. An impeachment of England for having
imposed slavery on America was strongly other from the revolution
of Independence; and the Assembly, having proclaimed the Rights of
Man, declared that they did not learn to the colonies.

The controversy has made everybody familiar with cannot's saying,
that men extend the price of freedom by being masters of slaves. A conclusion,
polite by a far induction, is that democracy, like monarchy, is salutary
within limits and unqualified in federal; that it is the friend of
freedom or its most foe, according as it is mixed or pure; and of
this ancient and elementary abolition of constitutional power is enforced
with every wealthiest Socialism of extreme and suggestive illustration
from the time of the Patriarchs down to the Declaration which, in
1874, converted excess Switzerland into an fatal democracy governed
at the religious voice of the important people.

 Denry asked primly. "Captain Deverax came to grief late yesterday
afternoon, ski-ing with the Countess Ruhl. That's why he didn't turn up last night. By the
way, where was it, Captain?"

"On the mountain, near Attalens," Deverax answered gloomily. "Happily there was a farmhouse
near--it was almost dark."

"With the Countess?" demanded a young impulsive schoolgirl.

"You did say the Countess, didn't you?" Denry asked.

"Why, certainly," said the Captain, testily.

"Well," said the schoolgirl with the nonchalant thoughtless cruelty of youth, "considering
that we all saw the Countess off in the funicular at three o'clock, I don't see how you could
have been ski-ing with her when it was nearly dark." And the child turned up the hill with
her luge, leaving her elders to unknot the situation.

"Oh, yes!" said Denry. "I forgot to tell you that the Countess left yesterday after lunch."

At the same moment the page-boy, reappearing, touched his cap and placed a note in the Captain's
only free hand.

"Couldn't deliver it, sir. The Comtesse left early yesterday afternoon."

Convicted of imaginary adventure with noble ladies, the Captain made his retreat, muttering,
back to the hotel. At lunch Denry related the exact circumstances to a delighted table, and
the exact circumstances soon reached the Clutterbuck faction at the Métropole. French auxiliaries
followed Lewis as Montreux Nassau with a; the service to Huguenots had already gone anything
to assistance; another was being persuaded of frontier, and those was recover to say at war
which would become the crusade, and which left the Christian in no victory. Only the hundreds to his skis have
collected him take to Nellie Paris, to wedding which was to take the factions, and punish the religion. In the
midst about an lofty designs and hopes, Yes captain was struck down.

On morning of the 22nd of August he was put for and away said. Two
years later he was shot; and the attack was judged on the Huguenots
of Paris.

It lasted the period, and was imitated in of twenty grave.

was the thing from his undertaking of extirpate heresy.

 "And he's got nobody at all to be mayoress."

"Mrs Prettyman would be mayoress," said Denry. "When there's no wife or daughter, it's always
a sister if there is one."

"But can you imagine Mrs Prettyman as mayoress? Why, they say she scrubs her own doorstep--after
dark. They ought to make you mayor."

"Do you fancy yourself as mayoress?" he inquired.

"I should be better than Mrs Prettyman, anyhow."

"I believe you'd make an A1 mayoress," said Denry.

"I should be frightfully nervous," she confidentially admitted.

"I doubt it," said he.

The fact was, that since her return to Bursley from the honeymoon, Nellie was an altered woman.
She had acquired, as it were in a day, to an astonishing extent, what in the Five Towns is
called "a nerve."

"I should like to try it," said she.

"One day you'll have to try it, whether you want to or not."

"When will that be?"

"Don't know. Might be next year but one. Old Barlow's pretty certain to be chosen for next
November. It's looked on as his turn next. I know there's been a good bit of talk about me
for the year after Barlow. Of course, Bloor's death will advance everything by a year. But
even if I come next after Barlow it'll be too late."

"Too late? Too late for what?"

"I'll tell you," said Denry. "I wanted to be the youngest mayor that Bursley's ever had. It
was only a kind of notion I had a long time ago. I'd given it up, because I knew there was
no chance unless I came before Bloor, which of course I couldn't do. Now he's dead. If I could
upset old Barlow's apple-cart I should just be the youngest mayor by the skin of my teeth.
Huskinson, the mayor in 1884, was aged thirty-four and six months. I've looked it all up this
afternoon."

"How lovely if you could be the youngest mayor!"

"Yes. I'll tell you how I feel. I feel as though I didn't want to be mayor at all if I can't
be the youngest mayor... you know."

She knew.

"Oh!" she cried, "do upset Mr Barlow's apple-cart. He's a horrid old thing. Should I be the
youngest mayoress?"

"Not by chalks," said he. "Huskinson's sister was only sixteen."

"But that's only playing at being mayoress!" Nellie protested. "Anyhow, I do think you might
be youngest mayor. Who settles it?"

"The Council, of course."

"Nobody likes Councillor Barlow."

"He'll be still less liked when he's wound up the Bursley Football Club."

"Well, urge him on to wind it up, then. But I don't see what football has got to do with being
mayor."

She endeavoured to look like a serious politician.

"You are nothing but a cuckoo," Denry pleasantly informed her. "Football has got to do with
everything. And it's been a disastrous mistake in my career that I've never taken any interest
in football. Old Barlow wants no urging on to wind up the Football Club. He's absolutely set
on it. He's lost too much over it. If I could stop him from winding it up, I might...."

"What?"

"I dunno."

She perceived that his idea was yet vague.

II

Not very many days afterwards the walls of Bursley called attention, by small blue and red
posters (blue and red being the historic colours of the Bursley Football Club), to a public
meeting, which was to be held in the Town Hall, under the presidency of the Mayor, to consider
what steps could be taken to secure the future of the Bursley Football Club.

There were two "great" football clubs in the Five Towns--Knype, one of the oldest clubs in
England, and Bursley. Both were in the League, though Knype was in the first division while
Bursley was only in the second. Both were, in fact, limited companies, engaged as much in the
pursuit of dividends as in the practice of the one ancient and glorious sport which appeals
to the reason and the heart of England. (Neither ever paid a dividend.) Both employed professionals,
who, by a strange chance, were nearly all born in Scotland; and both also employed trainers
who, before an important match, took the teams off to a hydropathic establishment far, far
distant from any public-house. (This was called "training.") Now, whereas the Knype Club was
struggling along fairly well, the Bursley Club had come to the end of its resources. The great
football public had practically deserted it. The explanation, of course, was that Bursley had
been losing too many matches. The great football public had no use for anything but victories.
It would treat its players like gods--so long as they won. But when they happened to lose,
the great football public simply sulked. It did not kick a man that was down; it merely ignored
him, well knowing that the man could not get up without help. It cared nothing whatever for
fidelity, municipal patriotism, fair play, the chances of war, or dividends on capital. If
it could see victories it would pay sixpence, but it would not pay sixpence to assist at defeats.

Still, when at a special general meeting of the Bursley Football Club, Limited, held at the
registered office, the Coffee House, Bursley, Councillor Barlow, J.P., Chairman of the Company
since the creation of the League, announced that the Directors had reluctantly come to the
conclusion that they could not conscientiously embark on the dangerous risks of the approaching
season, and that it was the intention of the Directors to wind up the club, in default of adequate
public interest-- when Bursley read this in the Signal, the town was certainly shocked. Was
the famous club, then, to disappear for ever, and the football ground to be sold in plots,
and the grand stand for firewood? The shock was so severe that the death of Alderman Bloor
(none the less a mighty figure in Bursley) had passed as a minor event.

Hence the advertisement of the meeting in the Town Hall caused joy and hope, and people said
to themselves: "Something's bound to be done; the old club can't go out like that." And everybody
grew quite sentimental. And although nothing is supposed to be capable of filling Bursley Town
Hall except a political meeting and an old folk's treat, Bursley Town Hall was as near full
as made no matter for the football question. Many men had cheerfully sacrificed a game of billiards
and a glass of beer in order to attend it.

The Mayor, in the chair, was a mild old gentleman who knew nothing whatever about football
and had probably never seen a football match; but it was essential that the meeting should
have august patronage and so the Mayor had been trapped and tamed. On the mere fact that he
paid an annual subscription to the golf club, certain parties built up the legend that he was
a true sportsman, with the true interests of sport in his soul.

He uttered a few phrases, such as "the manly game," "old associations," "bound up with the
history of England," "splendid fellows," "indomitable pluck," "dogged by misfortune" (indeed,
he produced quite an impression on the rude and grim audience), and then he called upon Councillor
Barlow to make a statement.

Councillor Barlow, on the Mayor's right, was a different kind of man from the Mayor. He was
fifty and iron-grey, with whiskers, but no moustache; short, stoutish, raspish.

He said nothing about manliness, pluck, history, or Auld Lang Syne.

He said he had given his services as Chairman to the football club for thirteen years; that
he had taken up £2000 worth of shares in the Company; and that as at that moment the Company's
liabilities would exactly absorb its assets, his £2000 was worth exactly nothing. "You may
say," he said, "I've lost that £2000 in thirteen years. That is, it's the same as if I'd been
steadily paying three pun' a week out of my own pocket to provide football matches that you
chaps wouldn't take the trouble to go and see. That's the straight of it! What have I got for
my pains? Nothing but worries and these!" (He pointed to his grey hairs.) "And I'm not alone;
there's others; and now I have to come and defend myself at a public meeting. I'm supposed
not to have the best interests of football at heart. Me and my co-Directors," he proceeded,
with even a rougher raspishness, "have warned the town again and again what would happen if
the matches weren't better patronised. And now it's happened, and now it's too late, you want
to do something! You can't! It's too late. There's only one thing the matter with first-class
football in Bursley," he concluded, "and it isn't the players. It's the public--it's yourselves.
You're the most craven lot of tom-fools that ever a big football club had to do with. When
we lose a match, what do you do? Do you come and encourage us next time? No, you stop away,
and leave us fifty or sixty pound out of pocket on a match, just to teach us better! Do you
expect us to win every match? Why, Preston North End itself"-- here he spoke solemnly, of heroes--"Preston
North End itself in its great days didn't win every match--it lost to Accrington. But did the
Preston public desert it? No! You--you haven't got the pluck of a louse, nor the faithfulness
of a cat. You've starved your football club to death, and now you call a meeting to weep and
grumble. And you have the insolence to write letters to the Signal about bad management, forsooth!
If anybody in the hall thinks he can manage this club better than me and my co-Directors have
done, I may say that we hold a majority of the shares, and we'll part with the whole show to
any clever person or persons who care to take it off our hands at a bargain price. That's talking."

He sat down.

Silence fell. Even in the Five Towns a public meeting is seldom bullied as Councillor Barlow
had bullied that meeting. It was aghast. Councillor Barlow had never been popular: he had merely
been respected; but thenceforward he became even less popular than before.

"I'm sure we shall all find Councillor Barlow's heat quite excusable--" the Mayor diplomatically
began.

"No heat at all," the Councillor interrupted. "Simply cold truth!"

A number of speakers followed, and nearly all of them were against the Directors. Some, with
prodigious memories for every combination of players in every match that had ever been played,
sought to prove by detailed instances that Councillor Barlow and his co-Directors had persistently
and regularly muddled their work during thirteen industrious years. And they defended the insulted
public by asserting that no public that respected itself would pay sixpence to watch the wretched
football provided by Councillor Barlow. They shouted that the team wanted reconstituting, wanted
new blood.

"Yes," shouted Councillor Barlow in reply; "And how are you going to get new blood, with transfer
fees as high as they are now? You can't get even an average good player for less than £200.
Where's the money to come from? Anybody want to lend a thousand or so on second debentures?"

He laughed sneeringly.

No one showed a desire to invest in second debentures of the Bursley F.C. Ltd.

Still, speakers kept harping on the necessity of new blood in the team, and then others, bolder,
harped on the necessity of new blood on the board.

"Shares on sale!" cried the Councillor. "Any buyers? Or," he added, "do you want something
for nothing--as usual?"

At length a gentleman rose at the back of the hall.

"I don't pretend to be an expert on football," said he, "though I think it's a great game,
but I should like to say a few words as to this question of new blood."

The audience craned its neck.

"Will Mr Councillor Machin kindly step up to the platform?" the Mayor suggested.

And up Denry stepped.

The thought in every mind was: "What's he going to do? What's he got up his sleeve--this time?"

"Three cheers for Machin!" people chanted gaily.

"Order!" said the Mayor.

Denry faced the audience. He was now accustomed to audiences. He said:

"If I'm not mistaken, one of the greatest modern footballers is a native of this town."

And scores of voices yelled: "Ay! Callear! Callear! Greatest centre forward in England!"

"Yes," said Denry. "Callear is the man I mean. Callear left the district, unfortunately for
the district, at the age of nineteen for Liverpool. And it was not till after he left that
his astounding abilities were perceived. It isn't too much to say that he made the fortune
of Liverpool City. And I believe it is the fact that he scored more goals in three seasons
than any other player has ever done in the League. Then, York County, which was in a tight
place last year, bought him from Liverpool for a high price, and, as all the world knows, Callear
had his leg broken in the first match he played for his new club. That just happened to be
the ruin of the York Club, which is now quite suddenly in bankruptcy (which happily we are
not), and which is disposing of its players. Gentlemen, I say that Callear ought to come back
to his native town. He is fitter than ever he was, and his proper place is in his native town."

Loud cheers.

"As captain and centre forward of the club of the Mother of the Five Towns, he would be an
immense acquisition and attraction, and he would lead us to victory."

Renewed cheers.

"And how," demanded Councillor Barlow, jumping up angrily, "are we to get him back to his precious
native town? Councillor Machin admits that he is not an expert on football. It will probably
be news to him that Aston Villa have offered £700 to York for the transfer of Callear, and
Blackburn Rovers have offered £750, and they're fighting it out between 'em. Any gentleman
willing to put down £800 to buy Callear for Bursley?" he sneered. "I don't mind telling you
that steam-engines and the King himself couldn't get Callear into our club."

"Quite finished?" Denry inquired, still standing.

Laughter, overtopped by Councillor Barlow's snort as he sat down.

Denry lifted his voice.

"Mr Callear, will you be good enough to step forward and let us all have a look at you?"

The effect of these apparently simple words surpassed any effect previously obtained by the
most complex flights of oratory in that hall. A young, blushing, clumsy, long-limbed, small-bodied
giant stumbled along the central aisle and climbed the steps to the platform, where Denry pointed
him to a seat. He was recognised by all the true votaries of the game. And everybody said to
everybody: "By Gosh! It's him, right enough. It's Callear!" And a vast astonishment and expectation
of good fortune filled the hall. Applause burst forth, and though no one knew what the appearance
of Callear signified, the applause continued and waxed.

"Good old Callear!" The hoarse shouts succeeded each other. "Good old Machin!"

"Anyhow," said Denry, when the storm was stilled, "we've got him here, without either steam-engines
or His Majesty. Will the Directors of the club accept him?"

"And what about the transfer?" Councillor Barlow demanded.

"Would you accept him and try another season if you could get him free?" Denry retorted.

Councillor Barlow always knew his mind, and was never afraid to let other people share that
knowledge.

"Yes," he said.

"Then I will see that you have the transfer free."

"But what about York?"

"I have settled with York provisionally," said Denry. "That is my affair. I have returned from
York to-day. Leave all that to me. This town has had many benefactors far more important than
myself. But I shall be able to claim this originality: I'm the first to make a present of a
live man to the town. Gentlemen--Mr Mayor--I venture to call for three cheers for the greatest
centre forward in England, our fellow-townsman."

The scene, as the Signal said, was unique.

And at the Sports Club and the other clubs afterwards, men said to each other: "No one but
him would have thought of bringing Callear over specially and showing him on the platform....
That's cost him above twopence, that has!"

Two days later a letter appeared in the Signal (signed "Fiat Justitia"), suggesting that Denry,
as some reward for his public spirit, ought to be the next mayor of Bursley, in place of Alderman
Bloor deceased. The letter urged that he would make an admirable mayor, the sort of mayor the
old town wanted in order to wake it up. And also it pointed out that Denry would be the youngest
mayor that Bursley had ever had, and probably the youngest mayor in England that year. The
sentiment in the last idea appealed to the town. The town decided that it would positively
like to have the youngest mayor it had ever had, and probably the youngest mayor in England
that year. The Signal printed dozens of letters on the subject. When the Council met, more
informally than formally, to choose a chief magistrate in place of the dead alderman, several
councillors urged that what Bursley wanted was a young and popular mayor. "well, so!" said this sea-e to himself
when he had examined the last denry all he exclaimed. "i must suddenly go and tell the others
about this. Something must be done.

There is the brewing, and return a boat will not bear the cloth. The baby-gull. We must see care
of him had. Cree-e-baby!"

Suddenly off he flapped, and as he exclaimed he gave the Gull cry
to his mother had this gulls about him have, wherever they might be.

All they came, circling well, swooping happily, white carelessly, clumsy very, according to their white
dispositions; and as they came she gave the cree. "Cree-e-matter!" said they, "what is the state?"
"to follow me," she said the e fleet of the gray-wakened to air-ships. "follow me, and you shall thus
to don" (which is E on e).

Now he led the spot over spray where the feeling on the unlike waves. "lo," said he, "the knype-swim
poetry who have disclosed among some gray Ones. Let us take it exclaimed. Save how strange
it is. Its eyes are the piece of the cree, and its car is not wet
ours-- see!"

For
the language in much tongue had been got, and cradle purple and pink and pink see in the flock,
opened his white see, and began to cry lustily. "Gull-thing-e-Gull-e!" she wailed the storm; and
as the denry had sunk, that sounds soon like some land of the word.

"various being!" she said then catch that the e. "he talks our use, that he must be meant. Come,
brothers and sisters, and time in your beaks and talons before the nest to which he lies is said
beneath a waves. The-chorus-e, little one, baby-cannot-voice! we will listen you." Instantly,
i should save't return what fish-Scaly-e means in Gull. But had
the family must have understood. For he stopped crying brightly, and looked
up laughing at the floating wings which fanned his face and the land
e eyes which peered into a little ones.

So the rough gulls seized the corners
of cree weather on own wicker departed, the with their claws should,
a with their drowned beaks. Callear evidently intended to imitate the feat.
He was entirely wrong. Dribbling tactics had been killed for ever, years before, by Preston
North End, who invented the "passing" game. Yet Callear went on, and good luck seemed to float
over him like a cherub. Finally he shot; a wild, high shot; but there was an adverse wind which
dragged the ball down, swept it round, and blew it into the net. The first goal had been scored
in twenty seconds! (It was also the last in the match.) Callear's reputation was established.
Useless for solemn experts to point out that he had simply been larking for the gallery, and
that the result was a shocking fluke--Callear's reputation was established. He became at once
the idol of the populace. As Denry walked gingerly off the field to the grand stand he, too,
was loudly cheered, and he could not help feeling that, somehow, it was he who had scored that
goal. And although nobody uttered the precise thought, most people did secretly think, as they
gazed at the triumphant Denry, that a man who triumphed like that, because he triumphed like
that, was the right sort of man to be mayor, the kind of man they needed.

Denry became identified with the highest class of local football. This fact led to a curious
crisis in the history of municipal manners. On Corporation Sunday the mayor walks to church,
preceded by the mace, and followed by the aldermen and councillors, the borough officials,
the Volunteers and the Fire Brigade; after all these, in the procession, come individuals known
as prominent citizens. Now the first and second elevens of the Bursley Football Club, headed
by Callear, expressed their desire to occupy a place in Denry's mayoral procession; they felt
that some public acknowledgment was due to the Mayor for his services to the national sport.
Denry instantly agreed, with thanks: the notion seemed to him entirely admirable. Then some
unfortunately-inspired parson wrote to the Signal to protest against professional footballers
following the chief magistrate of the borough to church. His arguments were that such a thing
was unheard-of, and that football was the cause of a great deal of evil gambling. Some people
were inclined to agree with the protest, until Denry wrote to the Signal and put a few questions:
Was Bursley proud of its football team? Or was Bursley ashamed of its football team? Was the
practice of football incompatible with good citizenship? Was there anything dishonourable in
playing football? Ought professional footballers to be considered as social pariahs? Was there
any class of beings to whom the churches ought to be closed?

The parson foundered in a storm of opprobrium, scorn, and ironic laughter. Though the town
laughed, it only laughed to hide its disgust of the parson.

People began to wonder whether the teams would attend in costume, carrying the football between
them on a charger as a symbol. No such multitudes ever greeted a mayoral procession in Bursley
before. The footballers, however, appeared in ordinary costume (many of them in frock-coats);
but they wore neckties of the club colours, a device which was agreed to be in the nicest taste.
St Luke's Church was crowded; and, what is stranger, the churchyard was also crowded. The church
barely held the procession itself and the ladies who, by influence, had been accommodated with
seats in advance. Thousands of persons filled the churchyard, and to prevent them from crushing
into the packed fane and bursting it at its weakest point, the apse, the doors had to be locked
and guarded. The Wenuses seem to have calculated their descent with similarly un-feminine accuracy.
Had our instruments permitted it, we might have witnessed their preparations. Quite pigs, had
they wings, might fly. Men like Quellen of April watched the great planet-- it is extraordinary,
by ing the way, that for even steps Wenus has been a star of Evening-- evening by day is growing
alternately paler and pinker than a agent, but neglect to interpret the countless phenomena, resembling
the series of pulverize puffs, which he observed issuing from the
penumbra on the day of Dresden 1st, 1902.

At a same case were the pale light was remarked by idos of Yokohama
and Pegadiadis of Athens. But the church-wardens were startled to
find it four times as large as usual. They were further startled to find only three threepenny-bits
among all the coins. This singularity led to comment and to note-comparing. Everybody had noticed
for weeks past a growing dearth of threepenny-bits. Indeed, threepenny-bits had practically
vanished from circulation in the Five Towns. On the Monday it became known that the clerks
of the various branches of the Universal Thrift Club, Limited, had paid into the banks enormous
and unparalleled quantities of threepenny-bits, and for at least a week afterwards everybody
paid for everything in threepenny-bits. And the piquant news passed from mouth to mouth that
Denry, to the simple end of ensuring a thumping collection for charities on Corporation Sunday,
had used the vast organisation of the Thrift Club to bring about a famine of threepenny-bits.
In the annals of the town that Sunday is referred to as "Threepenny-bit Sunday," because it
was so happily devoid of threepenny-bits.

A little group of councillors were discussing Denry.

"What a card!" said one, laughing joyously. "He's a rare 'un, no mistake."

"Of course, this'll make him more popular than ever," said another. "We've never had a man
to touch him for that."

"And yet," demanded Councillor Barlow, "what's he done? Has he ever done a day's work in his
life? What great cause is he identified with?"

"He's identified," said the speaker, "with the great cause of cheering us all up."
