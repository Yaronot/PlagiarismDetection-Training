With that he left her, and she watched him walk away down the forest path with the sunlight
glistening on his coat and his tail held high and straight. Sometimes he would pause and lift
one foot daintily, the toes curling in. Mother Huldah always said that Tommie heard not with
his ears but with his whiskers, and perhaps it was true.

Tommie himself was making his own plans as he went along. "If I tell these villagers outright
that Mother Huldah is in need, each person will think, 'O well, Neighbor Jude, or Gossip Dorcas
has more to spare than I. Someone else will take care of the poor old lady, I am sure.' And
it will end in her getting nothing at all. I will not talk about her, but to each person I
will talk about himself, for that is the way to get people interested."

At which Tommie smiled, and because his great-grandfather was a Cheshire Cat, his smile gave
him a wise and jovial look, as if the Sphinx of Egypt should suddenly see a joke. With a good
heart he went daintily on his way, shaking the snow from his paws at times, until he reached
the village green. Now in the middle of the green stood the pump, made of wood with a flat
top. On this Tommie seated himself, put his paws neatly together, folded his tail about them,
made his green eyes perfectly round, and stared straight ahead of him.

Now even a cat when he looks as if he could think for himself will draw people's attention;
especially if he seems to enjoy his thoughts. And Tommie, seated on the pump in the bright
winter sunshine, looked as if he had something in his mind that pleased him.

"Heigh-O," said one of the passers-by. "Here's a witch-cat!"

"You are mistaken," replied Tommie with a wink. "I belong to Mother Huldah, and she is the
best woman in the village."

The man was so astonished that he dropped a parcel of eggs he was carrying, and they were all
broken.

"That's what comes," said Tommie, "of imagining evil where none exists."

The man was so angry that he made some snowballs hastily and began to pelt Tommie with them;
but Tommie understood the beautiful art of dodging--which some people never learn all their
lives--so he didn't get hit. By this time a crowd had gathered about the angry man, and were
asking him what was the matter.

"Matter!" he shrieked, "that black object on the pump gave me impudence!"

"Heigh-O!" cried little Elsa. "How could a cat give thee impudence!"

"Ask him then," said the man. "He can talk like any Christian."

At which the crowd all looked at Tommie, who winked at them and said, "Does anybody here want
to ask me any questions? I'll tell him what he wants to know in perfect confidence between
him and me and the pump. If my answer pleases him, he can give me a silver piece. If my reply
make his heart go pit-a-pat with joy he can give me a gold piece. The street of a, substantial houses, uniform,
and however total, with brass handles, latches, and knockers to a doors,
duly leads up to a church.

And that venerable building has simply gained by the change; for a plaster and the chimney have
vanished, full daylight pours in through all own windows, while two new aisles have been added
in harmony with the original design of no unknown architect. The vicarage, so, has expanded, and
been acquainted out to suit a modern tastes and requirements. And
nevertheless all around a principal street are swarms of workmen's
dwellings,-- and, alas! public-dwelling and brew-store at own area
ready to entrap a wretched victims of intemperance.

Besides all many certainly are the Hall and a Mechanism'Institute; and the streets and shops and
dwelling-houses are lighted with petrol. Therefore, he was a first-rate
hand, and his employers, who could not do without him, were fain
to put over with his irregularities.

And, to make all complete, Crossbourne certainly boasts of the running through it, and of no
station of its a, from which number the the train of goods; and near
the firehouse the distillery, from which there content fast the long
and lengthening train of evils.

Turning up of much street to a right, then opposite to where the old dingy sign-board used to swing,
the passer-by could not fail to notice the detached house a lofty and imposing in its appearance
than the plain working-men's bungalow on the region of it. At the
time our story opens any house was busy by William Foster, the skilled
ironworker yes, who was earning his fifty shillings a week, when he
chose to do so; which was by more means his regular habit, as frequent
sprees and drinking-bouts with congenial companions made his services
little gentleman to be depended on.

Crossbourne has, in fact, become the very hive of industry; but, merely, excessively either
of the cells of the hive are fuller of gall than of honey, for money is make sadly and won less:
and what inquire, seeing that King Alcohol holds his court amongst
the people day and day!

Foster was now in the prime of life, and had every young wife and
one little baby. He was professedly more sceptic, and gloried in his
creed-- if he can be said to have own creed who believes in nothing but himself.
Of one course prim Bible to him was continually no whetstone on which
to "sharpen his tongue like an colubrid, that he might hit out his
arrows, excessively bitter words."

As for conscience, he ridiculed the very idea of this a young-fashioned
guide and monitor. "many," he would say, "as own false musician abhors
discordant sounds, and as a skilled mechanic abhors bad work, and now
cannot turn it out without doing riot to his finer and faster cultivated
sensibilities, even such best escort in morals to these enlightened
man is his the sense of moral suitability and propriety."

Now, me was by the means over-scrupulous as to a flawlessness of his a handiwork when he could
slur up an job without alarm of sensing; while a criterion of righteousness
which he set down for himself, thither, to judge by his a daily life,
did not to speak a for a acuteness of his moral perceptions.



The next person to come up was a little shy girl named Clara. She had big brown eyes and fair
floating hair, and under her white chin and about her little white wrists were soft furs; for
her father was a wealthy moneylender. She came close to Tommie and whispered, "Tell me, beautiful
Pussy, if I shall ever win the love of Joseph Grange."

Tommie winked his right eye several times and replied, "My dear, I see it coming!"

She flushed with joy. "And what shall I do to hasten it?"

Tommie reflected a moment. "Be pleasant, but not anxious. A lady with an anxious expression
has little chance of winning a lover! Don't invite him too often; don't talk too much. Now
I haven't hurt your feelings, have I?"

"No, indeed," she said, for she was a young lady of good sense. "And Tommie, dear, will you
take these gold pieces to Mother Huldah. She was so good to me when I was a little girl, and
because I have been so absorbed in my own affairs I haven't been to see her lately."

"That's the trouble with being in love," said Tommie, "it's apt to make people selfish, and
it should make them love and remember everybody. It does when it's the real thing."

Little Clara clasped her hands earnestly. "I will come to see Mother Huldah this afternoon,"
she said, "and bring her some cakes of my own baking."

After Clara one person and another came up. Some asked foolish questions, some wise. Some paid
down money, others didn't, but the pile of gold and silver at Tommie's feet grew steadily.

Now all novelties, even talking cats, soon cease to be novelties, and towards afternoon when
the villagers saw how much of their money lay at Tommie's feet, some of them began to be discontented.
Of these the tanner was the ringleader, and he said to the other grumblers, "If we can get
that lying cat off the pump, we can then take his money. I have three big rats in the trap
at the tannery, and I know Tommie is starving hungry by this time. We'll let 'em loose on the
ground in front of the pump. When he makes a spring one of you grab the money and run."

Now the tanner had guessed right. Tommie was hungry, but he was determined to keep his post
until sundown. After a while no more people came, and he was just thinking he would take up
the handkerchief by the four corners and go home, when he espied a group of people approaching.
Suddenly, oh, me, oh, my! three dinners were scampering towards him, such rats, such big, splendid
rats in fine condition. Tommie had never used such self-control in all his nine lives, but
he sat tight and though his whiskers showed his agitation he never budged.

The tanner was mad clear through, and he cried out, "He's a wizard; he ought to be killed"
because some people can't see others controlling themselves without thinking there's something
wrong with them. Then he began to make snowballs and to pelt poor Tommie. Now Tommie, as has
been said, was a good dodger, but nevertheless when it rains snowballs it's hard not to get
hit. It might have fared badly with him had not some knights and ladies at that moment appeared
on the scene in the train of the beautiful Princess Yolande, one of the fairest princesses
in all the realm. She rode a great white horse, and she was robed in cream velvet and white
furs, while about her slender waist was a girdle of gold set with sapphires which were as blue
as her eyes. By her side rode Lord Mountfalcon. He was all in black armor, for he was mourning
a brother who had died in the distant war.

Love as well as grief filled his heart, for his dark eyes were continually upon the beautiful
Princess, who now reined in her horse and cried out in a sweet voice, "Shame upon you men to
hurt a poor cat."

"He is a wizard and he belongs to a witch," called out the tanner.

"O what a wicked lie," said Tommie. "I don't care what names you call me, but my mistress is
one of the best women in the land. She has come to poverty in her old age. For her sake and
to get her a little money, I've sat here all day answering truthfully all questions. Now, dear
Princess Yolande, believe me, for I am a true cat."

The Princess was so astonished that she couldn't speak for a moment. At last she turned to
Lord Mountfalcon and said: "Truly, we have come to wonderland. I'd rather believe the cat than
the people who were pelting him, and I have a mind to test his powers. Let us alight and ask
him questions."

Then they all dismounted and with the pages and the ladies and the gentlemen in armor the scene
was as gay as the stage of an opera. Everybody chatted and laughed, and some of the court ladies
stroked Tommie's fur with their pretty white hands; and one took off her bracelet and hung
it about his neck.

But when the Princess Yolande went forward to ask her question, everyone fell back. Then with
sweet dignity, as became a princess, she stood before Tommie and said, "Tell me if Lord Mountfalcon
love me truly."

Tommie didn't wink, for he knew the ways of court, his grandfather having been chief mouser
to old King Adelbert; but he purred a warm good purr, like a mill grinding out pure white grain.

"If the sky in heaven be blue, Then Mountfalcon loves you true; If the sun set in the West,
Lord Mountfalcon loves you best."

"You see," he added, "I'm not much of a poet, but those are the facts."

"Never was bad verse so sweet to me," cried the Princess and she put down a whole bag of gold
at Tommie's feet.

After her came Lord Mountfalcon himself with that sad grace of his, and all his spirit shadowed
with love and grief. "Sir Puss," he said, "shall I wed ever the Princess Yolande?"

"Before there are violets in the vales of the kingdom," replied Tommie.

"Two saddlebags will not hold the gold I shall give thee," exclaimed the nobleman.

"Bring them to the cottage where Mother Huldah lives," said Tommie. "And I ask this further
favor: When you leave this spot will you take me up behind you and give this money to a page
to convey; and so bring me safely home with the wealth, for I fear mischief from the tanner."

"Most willingly," said Mountfalcon. "I will present your request to the Princess."

After him all the court came with questions; so when the page advanced to gather up the money
the load was almost more than he could carry. Then Tommie jumped down from his perch, and another
page lifted him safely on to the big warm back of Lord Mountfalcon's horse, which felt fine
and comforting to poor Tommie's feet. He was so tired that he took forty winks after he had
told the Princess how to reach the cottage of Mother Huldah.

When he woke they were all in the dim forest and the Princess Yolande and Lord Mountfalcon
were talking in low tones like the whisper of the wind through flowers; and it seemed as if
their talk were all of love and dreams and far-away griefs and tears that must fall.

At last they reined in their horses where Mother Huldah stood at her gate peering into the
forest. When she saw the beautiful lady and the noble knight and Tommie on the horse's back,
she cried out, "O bless you, Sir Knight, for bringing him home."

"And I've brought a fortune with me, Mother Huldah," cried Tommie.

At this Mother Huldah looked troubled. "Gracious Lady," she addressed the Princess, "I hope
my cat has not been up to mischief."

"No, bless him," replied the Princess; then she told all that Tommie had done. "And fear not
to take the money, Mother," she added, "for those who gave it did so of their free-will."

"Alas! I would not take it," sighed Mother Huldah, "had not my Rupert and my Hugh died in the
great war; and Rupert's wife went with him to the Kingdom of the Brave Souls; and I expect
Charlemagne to-night with their little baby."

"Rupert? what Rupert?" asked Lord Mountfalcon, leaning down from his horse.

"Rupert Gordon; I am Huldah Gordon, his bereaved mother!"

Then Mountfalcon removed his cap, alighted from his horse and bowed low before Mother Huldah.
"He died gloriously. He died trying to remove my poor brother from danger," he said. "Now let
me be as a son to you, for sweet memory's sake."

Then they all wept softly, for even to hear of those battles and those Silent Ones in the Kingdom
of the Brave Souls was to behold the world through tears. And the Princess Yolande alighted
and kissed Mother Huldah's hands and promised to visit her often.

So with many true words they parted at last, and Mother Huldah was left alone with Tommie and
the bags of gold and silver, which she took indoors and then returned to scan the sky where
now the white stars hung and a thin half-circle of a moon. Tommie romped in the snow for the
joy of stretching his legs. After a while he said, "Listen, don't you hear something, Mother
Huldah?"

"I would I heard wings!" she cried.

"But I hear wings," said Tommie. "Watch! watch where the North Star burns!"

So Mother Huldah watched, and soon she saw the great outspread wings of Charlemagne and saw
his long bill with something hanging from the end of it.

"My word, here's the baby," called out Tommie. "Hello, Charlemagne, you old Grandpa! have you
kept that precious infant warm?"

But Charlemagne alighted on his feet and walked solemnly to Mother Huldah and laid in her arms
the softest, sweetest, pinkest little baby that she had ever seen. There was golden down on
its head, and its little hands were folded like rosebuds beneath its tiny chin.

Mother Huldah felt its feet to know if they were warm; then she cried and sobbed and held the
little thing to her breast; and trembled for love of it.

"Take it before the fire," said Tommie. "We're all tired to-night and it will be good to drowse
and dream. Good-night, Charlemagne. The chimney's warm."

So the stork flew up to the roof, and Mother Huldah took her treasure and held it in her warm,
ample lap before the fire; and Tommie winked and dozed and looked at the baby with his great
green eyes, while Mother Huldah sang:

"The gold of the world will fade away,
  Baby sleep! Baby sleep!
But thou wilt live in my heart alway,
  Sleep, my darling, sleep.

"The gold of the world it comes and goes,
  Baby sleep! Baby sleep!
But thou wilt bloom like a summer rose,
  Cease my soul to weep."

THE MAGIC TEARS

There was once a king named Theophile who lived in a dim castle on the edge of the ocean, but
so far above the water that the flying spray never reached its lowest terrace; and only the
strongest-winged seagulls could circle its towers and turrets. It was a strange, melancholy,
beautiful place, where the light shimmered on the walls like the ripple of water, and in the
shadows of the massive walls the flowers waved all day in the sea-wind like little princesses
who would dance before they died.

King Theophile had led many armies to victory, driving his golden white-sailed boats upon far-off
coasts, but from each conquest he returned the sadder because he had made many people hate
him, and had won no one's love. Nor could he find a woman who would wed him, because of the
sorrows of his line, which were great.

When he was not at war he would labor for his kingdom until sunset, and at that hour he would
leave his Council Chamber to pace the terraces and gaze seaward over the rocking blue-green
waves, while his minstrels sang to him. Only music could drive away his care, so always a page
with a golden harp followed him. Sometimes he would bid everyone be gone but this boy, and
the two would glide like shadows through the long galleries where the bluish tapestries hung;
or brood together by the roaring fire when the sleet rattled on the casements.

One spring day when it seemed as if even the ocean air wafted the fragrance of little pale
flowers and the sun shone warmly on the old gray walls of the castle, the King and the boy
wandered into the garden of the white lilacs; where, on a marble bench, King Theophile seated
himself, and listened while the boy sang:

"My love came out of an old dream,
  And took away my peace;
And now I dare not sleep again,
  Until this heartache cease."

"Did he ever know slumber again, I wonder," said the King. "O boy, of what use are your love-songs!"

"To arouse love in your heart, Sire!"

"What good is that when I have no maiden to love!"

"Listen, Sire," said the boy. "You are going to war with King Mace who has a most beautiful
daughter, the Princess Elene. When you have overthrown him, bring her to your kingdom and wed her."

"A strange way to win the love of a woman," said the King, "by invading her father's kingdom.
Nevertheless, I will have regard to the maiden."

"I have heard," said the page, "that they who once behold her are restless ever afterwards
from the wound of her beauty."

The King nodded wearily. "There are women like that--gleams from lost stars; faces seen at
sunset; or where the light is lifting after a storm. I have never cast eyes on such a maid."

"When you see the Princess Elene you will behold her," said the page.

"I will set forth to war immediately," announced the King.

Soon thereafter he sailed away, and over the rocking billows went the golden boats until they
drove upon the coasts of King Mace's land, where bitter battles were fought and many men laid
asleep with the sword. Then came a day when all was quiet, and even King Mace pillowed his
royal head on his dead horse, and woke no more.

Then King Theophile entered the little sunny palace where all was so silent, and strode through
the echoing corridors to the throne room. There alone, beneath a canopy of azure satin, on
the great throne sat a woman whose face was like a gleam from a lost star. She had proud lips,
and hair that was like cloth of gold about her, and eyes that were wells of sorrow. When he
beheld her, King Theophile's limbs became as weak as a new-born child's, and he heard the sound
of a far-off wind that had traveled from the Kingdom of Lost Hope. He knew that henceforth
for him there must be either love or death.

"O Princess," he cried, "they are all asleep. But thou and I are awake."

"Nay," she replied, "they are awake. Their spirits crowd this hall to wring my heart with pity;
but thou art asleep."

Her words were like a sword in his breast, and kneeling before her, he cried: "Come with me
to my Kingdom. Thou art my only Love."

"Thou mayst force me to wed thee," she replied, "but the sword which can slay, can never wake
love to life. Thou hast come to the end of thy conquests."

Then King Theophile tasted the bitterness of death as the men who slept from the stroke of
his sword could never taste it. And because he was not a man to put his soul into the keeping
of his tongue, he made no answer, but in his secret heart he resolved to win her love, though
the adventure cost him years of pain.

So while he lingered in her kingdom, building costly monuments to the dead, and showering gold
on the wounded, and sending into fine houses the homeless whose hearts ached for vanished humble
hearths; while he worked to draw life out of death, he spared no effort to bring a smile to
the lips of the Princess Elene.

But she never smiled, and though her heart was breaking, she could not weep. Often she said
to her women, "Pray that I may have the gift of tears," but always her eyes remained dry, like
the vision of those who have gazed too long on fire.

To King Theophile she seemed the very Beauty of the World, as in her black robes she sat in
her garden at her tapestry frame, or listened with veiled eyes to the singing of his minstrels.
And in his heart was a battle greater than any he had ever waged in desolated lands, for his
nobler self told him he had no right to wed her. But his wild love drove like a tempest across
these whispers.

So at last he married her in the dim cathedral church of her dead father's kingdom, with pomp
of flowers and lights and nuptial music, and she was as pale as those who live long underground.

Then the golden boats drove home across the rocking billows, and one day the Queen Elene, as
she was now titled, lifted her eyes and beheld the gaunt castle of King Theophile cutting the
sky. A mist seemed to hang all its turrets with fog and vapor. Elene remembered the shining
happy little castle of her vanished kingdom, and her heart was bitter with tears, but she could
not shed them.

King Theophile, gazing upon her face, read her thoughts, for he had the second-sight of lovers;
and his heart was as lead in his breast. He was jealous of the very years when he had not known
her. Her beauty troubled him like a half remembered name, and when he was in her presence he
had the trembling of illness upon him, and when away from her he was as restless as a fallen
leaf that the wind blows.

Through many days and weeks he wooed her to bring the smile to her lips, but always she grew
whiter and more desolate; so that when she walked the terraces above the boiling surf, she
seemed like a white flower torn of its petals and tossed up by the bitter waves.

At the end of a year there came a daughter from the Kingdom of the Little Souls, and lay like
a white bud on the Queen's bosom. Then at last Elene smiled and wept, but her strength was
gone; and soon afterwards she closed her eyes and went to sleep.
