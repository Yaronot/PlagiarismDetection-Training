'Oh, Sir, this would be naught, save that I am all that lies between her--the Lady Esclairmonde--and
Boemond of Burgundy;' and as at that moment Bedford saw the gold betrothal ring on the finger,
his countenance lost something of the pitying concern it had worn.  Malcolm detected the expression,
and rallying his powers the more, continued: 'Sir, there was no help--they vowed that she must
choose between Boemond and me.  On the faith of a dying man, I hold her troth but in trust;
I pledged myself to her to restore it when her way is clear to her purpose.  She would never
be mine but in name.  And now who will save her?  My life alone is between her and yonder wolf.
Oh, Sir Duke, promise me to save her, and I die content.'

'This is mere waste of time!' broke in the Duke.  'Where are the knave chirurgeons?--See, James,
if the lad dies, 'twill be from mere loss of blood; there is no inward bleeding; and if there
be no more loitering, he will do well.'

And seeing the surgeons at hand, he would have risen to make way, but Malcolm held him fast,
reiterating, 'Save her, Sir.'

'If your life guards her, throw it not away by thus dallying,' said Bedford, disengaging himself;
while Malcolm groaned heavily, and turned his heavy eyes to his royal friend, who said kindly,
'Fear not, dear cousin; either thou wilt live, or he will be better than his word.'

'God will guard her, I know,' said Malcolm; 'and oh! my own dear lord, I need not ask you to
be the brother to my poor sister you have been to me. At least all will be clear for her and
Patie!'

'I trust not yet,' said James, smiling in encouragement.  'Thou wilt live, my faithful laddie.'

Malcolm was spent and nearly fainting by this time, and all his reply was a few gasps of 'Only
say you pardon me all, my lord, and will speak for her to the Duke! ask her prayers for me!'
and as James sealed his few words of reply with a kiss, he closed his eyes, and became unconscious;
in which state he was conveyed to his bed.

'You might have set his mind at rest,' said James, somewhat hurt, to the Duke.

'Who?  I!' said Bedford.  'I cannot stir a finger that could set us at enmity with Burgundy,
for any lady in the land.  Moreover, if she have found means to secure herself once, she can
do so again.'

'I would you could have been more kind to my poor boy,' said James.

'Methought I was the most reasonably kind of you all!  Had it not been mere murder to keep
him there prating and bleeding, I had asked of him what indiscretion had blown the secret and
perilled the signet.  No robbers were those between Paris and Vincennes in our midst, but men
who knew what he bore.  I'll never--'

Bedford just restrained himself from saying, 'trust a Scot again;' but his manner had vexed
and pained James, who returned to Malcolm, and left him no more till called by necessity to
his post as King Henry's chief mourner, when the care of him was left to Patrick Drummond and
old Bairdsbrae; and Malcolm was a very tranquil patient, who seemed to need nothing but the
pleasure of looking at the ring on his finger.  The weapon had evidently touched no vital part,
and he was decidedly on the way to recovery, when on the second evening Bedford met James,
saying: 'I have seen Robsart.  It was no indiscretion of young Glenuskie's.  It was only what
comes of dealing with women.  Can I see the boy without peril to him?'

Malcolm was so much better, that there was no reason against the Duke's admission, and soon
Bedford's falcon-face looked down on him in all its melancholy.

'Thanks, my Lord Glenuskie,' he said; 'I thought not to be sending you on a service of such risk.'

'It was a welcome service,' said Malcolm.

Bedford's brows knitted themselves for a moment as he said, 'I came to ask whether you deem
that this hurt was from a common robber or routier.'

'Assuredly not,' said Malcolm, but very low; and looking up into his face, as he added, 'This
should be for your ear alone, Sir.'

They were left alone, and the Duke said: 'I have heard from Robsart how the ring was obtained.
You may spare that part of the story.'

'Sir,' said Malcolm, 'when the Lady Esclairmonde' (for he was not to be balked of dwelling
on that name with prolonged delight) 'had brought me the ring, Sir Lewis Robsart advised my
setting forth without loss of time.'

'So he told me,' said the Duke; 'and likewise that you took his words so literally as to set
out with only three followers.'

'Ay, Sir; but he knew not wherefore.  My escort had gone forth into the city, and while they
were being collected, a message bade me to the Lady Esclairmonde's presence.  I went, suspecting
naught, but I found myself in presence of Madame of Hainault, and of a veiled lady--who, my
Lord--' He paused.  'She was broad in form, and had a trick of gasping as though over-fat.'

Bedford nodded.  Every one knew Queen Isabeau by these tokens.

'She scarce spoke, my Lord; but the Countess Jaqueline pretended to be in one of her merry
moods.  She told me one good turn deserved another, and that, as in gratitude and courtesy
bound, I must do her the favour of either lending her the signet, or, if I would not let it
out of my hands, of setting it to a couple of parchments, which she declared King Henry had
promised to grant.'

'The false woman!'

'Sir, words told not on her.  She laughed and clapped her hands at whatever I said of honour,
faith, or trust.  She would have it that it was a jest--nay, romping fashion, she seized my
hand, which I let her have, knowing it was only my own seal that was on it.  Never was I so
glad that the signet being too small for my fingers, it was in my bosom.'

'Knew you what the parchments bore?' asked, Bedford, anxiously.

'One--so far as I could see--was of the Duke of Orleans' liberty,' said Malcolm.  'The other--pardon
me, Sir--it bore the names of Duke Humfrey and Countess Jaqueline.'

'The shameless wanton!' broke forth Bedford.  'How did you escape her at last, boy?'

'Sir,' said Malcolm, turning as red as loss of blood permitted, 'she had not kept her hands
off me; therefore when she stood between me and the door, I told her that discourtesy was better
than trust-breaking, and while she jeered at my talking out of a book of chivalry, I e'en took
her by the hands, lifted her aside, opened the door, ran down-stairs, and so to the stables,
where I mounted with the only three men I could get together.'

Bedford could not but laugh, as he added, 'Bravely done, Lord Malcolm; but, I fear me, she
will never forgive you.  What next?'

'I left word for the other fellows to join us at the hostel by the gate, and tarried for them
till I feared being here after the gates were fast; then set out without them, and rode till,
just within the forest, a band of men, how many I cannot tell, were on us, and before my sword
was well drawn they had surrounded me, and seized my bridle.  One of them bade me submit quietly,
and they would not harm me, if I would yield up that which I wist of.  I said I would sooner
yield my life than my trust; whereupon they mastered me, and dragged me off my horse, and were
rifling me, when I--knowing the Flemish accent of that drunken fellow of the Countess's--called
out, "Shame on you, Ghisbert!"  Then it was that he stabbed me, even at the moment when the
holy Saints sent brave Percy and the rest to rush in upon them.'

'You are sure it was Ghisbert?' repeated Bedford, anxiously.

'As certain as a man's voice can make me,' said Malcolm.  'Methinks, had I not named him, he
would perhaps have bound me to a tree, and left it to be thought that they were but common
thieves.'

'Belike,' said Bedford, thoughtfully.  'We are beholden to you, my Lord Glenuskie; the whole
state of England is beholden to you for the saving of the confusion and evils the loss of that
ring would have caused.  You can keep counsel, I wot well.  Then let all this matter of the
Queen and Countess rest a secret.'

Malcolm looked amazed; and Bedford added: 'I cannot quarrel with the woman, nor banish her
from Court.  Did we accuse her, Holland would become Armagnac; nor is she subject of ours,
to have justice done on her. It is for her interest to hush the matter up, and it must be ours
too.  If that knave Ghisbert ever gives me the chance, he shall hang like a dog; but for the
rest--' he shrugged his shoulders.

'And,' said Malcolm, 'Ghisbert only meant to serve his lady.  Any vassal of mine would do the
like for me or my sister.'

Bedford half smiled; then sighed and said: 'Once we were like to get laws more obeyed than
lords; but that is all over now!  Yet you, young Sir, have seen a great pattern; you will have
great powers!'

'Sir,' interrupted Malcolm, 'I pray you believe me, great powers I shall not have.  As I told
you last night, I do but hold this precious troth in trust!  It must be a secret, or it would
not save her; but you--oh, Sir! you will believe that!'

'If it be so,' said Bedford, gravely, 'it is too sacred a trust to be spoken of.  You will
deserve greater honour if you keep your word, than ever you will receive from the world.  Farewell--and
recover fast.'

Malcolm did not meet with much encouragement from the few to whom he thought fit to confide
the conditions of his espousal.  The King allowed that he could not have acted otherwise, but
was concerned at it, because of the hindrance that might for years be interposed in the way
of his welfare; and secretly hoped that Malcolm, in his new capacity, would so gain on Esclairmonde's
esteem and gratitude, as to win her affection, and that by mutual consent they would lay aside
their loftier promises, and take up their espousal where they had left it.

And what James secretly desired, Sir Patrick Drummond openly recommended. In his eyes, Malcolm
would be no better than a fool if he let his ladye- love, with all her lands, slip through
his fingers, when she was lawfully his own.  Patrick held that a monastery was a good place
to be nursed in if wounded, and a convenience for disposing of dull or weakly younger sons;
and he preferred that there should be some holy men to pray for those who did the hard and
bloody work of the world; but he had no desire that any one belonging to himself should plunge
into extra sanctity; and the more he saw Malcolm developing into a man among men, the more
he opposed the notion of his dedicating himself.

A man!  Yes; Malcolm was rising from his bed notably advanced in manliness.  As the King's
keen eye had seen from the first, and as Esclairmonde had felt, there was an elevation, tenderness,
and refinement in his cast of character, which if left to his natural destiny would have either
worn out his life early in the world, or carried him to the obscure shelter of a convent. 
In the novelty of the secular life, and temptations of all kinds, dread of ridicule, and the
flood of excitements which came with reviving health, that very sensitiveness led him astray;
and the elevated aims fell with a heavier fall when diverted from heavenly palaces to earthly
ones.  Self-reproach and dejection drove him further from the right course, and in proportion
to the greater amount of conscience he had by nature, his character was the more deteriorating.
His deeds were far less evil in themselves than those of many of his companions, but inasmuch
as they were not thoughtless in him, they were injuring him more.  But the sudden shock of
Patrick's danger roused him to a new sense of shame.  King Henry's death had lifted his mind
out of the earthly atmosphere, and then the treasure of Esclairmonde's pure and perfect trust
seemed to be the one thing to be guarded worthily and truly. "he is regretful-looking before it
know boat; straight, it was the morn, good, voyeur,'constituent. Again airs i was no monkey; and he
were'mho was the voice." "'it, De." "no, i was no; more'element merely. I mustn't excessively

"i believe she would be if she. Hence. Them was happy, on having assist in i. Shall nowadays?"
  Four hundred men-at-arms in black armour,
with lances pointed downwards, formed the guard behind; and the vanguard was of clergy, robed
in white, bearing banners and wax lights, and chanting psalms.  At the border of every parish,
all the ecclesiastics thereto appertaining, parochial, chantry, and monastic, turned out to
meet the procession with their tapers; escorted it to the principal church; performed Mass
there, if it were in the forenoon; and then accompanied the coffin to the other limit of their
ground, and consigned it to the clerks of the next parish.  At night, the royal remains always
rested in a church, guarded by alternate watches of the English men-at-arms, and sung over
by the local clergy, while the escort were quartered in the town, village, or abbey where the
halt chanced to be made.  Very slow was this progress; almost like a continual dream was that
long column, moving, moving on--white in front, black behind--when seen winding over a hill,
or, sometimes, the banners peering over the autumn foliage of some thicket, all composed to
profound silence and tardy measured tread; while the chants rose and fell with the breeze,
like unearthly music.  Many moved on more than half asleep; and others of the younger men felt
like Ralf Percy, who, for all his real sorrow for the King, declared that, were it not for
rushing out, morning and evening, for a bathe and a gallop, to fly a hawk or chase a hare,
he should some day run crazed, blow out all the wax lights, or play some mad prank to break
the intolerable oppression.  Malcolm smiled at this; but to him, still in the dreamy inertness
of recovery, this tranquil onward movement in the still autumn weather had some thing in it
of healing influence; and the sweet chants, the continual offices of devotion, were accordant
with his present tone of mind, and deepened the purpose he had formed.

Queen Catherine and her ladies joined the funeral march at Rouen, or rather followed it at
a mile's interval; but the two trains kept apart, and only occasional messages were sent from
one to the other.  Some of the gentlemen, who had a wife or sister in the Queen's suite, would
ride at nightfall to pay her a hasty visit; but Malcolm--though he longed to be sent--durst
not intrude upon Esclairmonde; and the Duke of Bedford was not only forced to spend all the
evening and half the night in business, but was not loth to put off the day of the meeting
with his dear sister Catherine--to say nothing of the 'Woman of Hainault.'

Therefore it was not until all had arrived at Calais, where a fleet was waiting to meet them,
that any visits were openly made by the one party to the other.

Bedford and James went together to the apartments of the Queen, and while they saw her in private,
Malcolm came blushing towards Esclairmonde, and was welcomed by her with a frank smile, outstretched
hand, and kind inquiry after his recovery.

She treated him indeed as a brother, as one on whom she depended, and had really wished to
see and arrange with.  She told him that Alice Montagu and her husband were returning to England,
and that her little friend had so earnestly prayed her to abide with her at Middleham for the
present, that she had consented--'until such time as the way be open,' said Esclairmonde, with
her steady patient smile.

Malcolm bowed his head.  'I am glad you will not be forced to be with your Countess,' he said.

'My poor lady!  Maybe I have spoken too plainly.  But I owe her much.  I must ever pray for
her.  And you, my lord?'

'I,' said Malcolm, 'shall go to study at Oxford.  Dr. Bennet intends returning thither to continue
his course of teaching, and my king has consented to my studying with him.  It will not cut
me off, lady, from that which you permit me to be.  King Henry and his brothers have all been
scholars there.'

'I understand,' said Esclairmonde, slightly colouring.  'It is well.  And truly I trust that
matters may be so guided, that care for me may not long detain you from more lasting vows--be
they of heaven or earth.'

'Lady,' said Malcolm, earnestly, 'none who had been plighted to you could pledge himself to
aught else save One above!'

Then, feeling in himself, or seeing in Esclairmonde's face, that he was treading on dangerous
ground, he asked leave to present to her his cousin, Patrick Drummond: and this was accordingly
done; the lady comporting herself with so much sweet graciousness, that the good knight, as
they left the hall, exclaimed: 'By St. Andrew, Malcolm, if you let that maiden escape you now
she is more than half-wedded to you, you'll be the greatest fool in broad Scotland.  Why, she
is a very queen for beauty, and would rule Glenuskie like a princess--ay, and defend the Castle
like Black Agnes of Dunbar herself!  If you give her up, ye'll be no better than a clod.'

Malcolm and Patrick had been borne off by James's quitting the Castle; Bedford remained longer,
having affairs to arrange with the Queen.  As he left her, he too turned aside to the window
where Esclairmonde sat as usual spinning, and Lady Montagu not far off, but at present absorbed
by her father, who was to remain in France.

One moment's hesitation, and then Bedford stepped towards the Demoiselle de Luxemburg, and
greeted her.  She looked up in his face, and saw its settled look of sad patient energy, which
made it full ten years older in appearance than when they had sat together at Pentecost, and
she marked the badge that he had assumed, a torn-up root with the motto, 'The root is dead.'

'Ah! my lord, things are changed,' she could not help saying, as she felt that he yearned for
comfort.

'Changed indeed!' he said; 'God's will be done!  Lady,' he added, 'you wot of that which once
passed between us.  I was grieved at first that you chose a different protector in your need.'

'You could not, my lord,' faltered Esclairmonde, crimson as she never had been when speaking
to Malcolm.

'No, I could not,' said Bedford; 'and, lady, my purpose was to thank you for the generous soul
that perceived that so it is.  You spared me from a cruel case.  I have no self any longer,
Esclairmonde; all I am, all I have, all I can, must be spent in guarding Harry's work for his
boy.  To all else I am henceforth dead; and all I can do is to be thankful, lady, that you
have spared me the sorest trial of all, both to heart and honour.'

Esclairmonde's eyes were downcast, as she said, 'Heaven is the protector of those of true and
kind purpose;' and then gathering courage, as being perfectly aware to whom Bedford must give
his hand if he would conciliate Burgundy, she added, 'And, verily, Sir, the way of policy is
this time a happy one.  Let me but tell you how I have known and loved gentle Lady Anne.'

Bedford shook his head with a half smile and a heavy sigh.  'Time fails me, dear lady,' he
said; 'and I cannot brook any maiden's praise, even from you.  I only wait to ask whether there
be any way yet left wherein I can serve you.  I will strive to deal with your kinsmen to restore
your lands.'

'Hold!' said Esclairmonde.  'Never for lands of mine will I have your difficulties added to.
No--let them go!  It was a vain, proud dream when I thought myself most humble, to become a
foundress; and if I know my kinsmen, they will be too much angered to bestow on me the dower
required by a convent.  No, Sir; all I would dare to inquire would be, whether you have any
voice in choosing the bedeswomen of St. Katharine's Hospital?'

'The bedeswomen!  They come chiefly from the citizens, not from princely houses like yours!'
said John, in consternation.

'I have done with princely houses,' said Esclairmonde.  'A Flemish maiden would be of no small
service among the many whom trade brings to your port from the Netherlands, and my longing
has ever been to serve my Lord through His poor and afflicted.'

'It is my father's widow who holds the appointments,' said John.  'Between her and me there
hath been little good-will, but my dear brother's last act towards her was of forgiveness.
She may wish to keep well with us of the Regency--and more like still, she will be pleased
that one of so great a house as yours should sue to her.  I will give you a letter to her,
praying her to remember you at the next vacancy; and mayhap, if the Lady Montagu could take
you to visit her, you could prevail with her! But, surely, some nunnery more worthy of your rank--'

'There is none that I should love so well,' said Esclairmonde, smiling. 'Mayhap I have learnt
to be a vagabond, but I cannot but desire to toil as well as pray.'

'And you are willing to wait for a vacancy?'

'When once safe from my kinsmen, in England, I will wait under my kind Alice's wing till--till
it becomes expedient that yonder gentleman be set free.'

'You trust him?' said Bedford.

'Entirely,' responded Esclairmonde, heartily.

'Happy lad!' half sighed the Duke; but, even as he did so, he stood up to bid the lady adieu--lingering
for a moment more, to gaze at the face he had longed for permission to love--and thus take
leave of all his youth and joy, addressing himself again to that burthen of care which in thirteen
years laid him in his grave at Rouen.

As he left the Castle and came out into the steep fortified street, Ralf Percy came up to him,
laughing.  'Here, my lord, are those two honest Yorkshire knights running all over Calais to
make a petition to you.'

'What--Trenton and Kitson!  I thought their year of service was up, and they were going home!'

'Ay, my lord,' said Kitson, who with his comrade had followed close in Percy's wake, 'we were
going home to bid Mistress Agnes take her choice of us; but this morn we've met a pursuivant
that is come with Norroy King- at-arms, and what doth he but tell us that no sooner were our
backs turned, than what doth Mistress Agnes but wed--ay, wed outright--one Tom of the Lee,
a sneaking rogue that either of us would have beat black and blue, had we ever seen him utter
a word to her?  A knight's lady--not to say two--as she might have been!  So, my lord, we not
being willing to go home and be a laughing-stock, crave your license to be of your guard as
we were of King Harry's, and show how far we can go among the French.'

'And welcome; no good swords can be other than welcome!' said Bedford, not diverted as his
brother would have been, but with a heartiness that never failed to win respectful affection.

Long did James and Bedford walk up and down the Castle court together, while the embarkation
was going on.  The question weighed on them both whether they should ever meet more, after
eighteen years of youth spent together.

'Youth is gone,' said Bedford.  'We have been under a mighty master, and now God help us to
do his work.'

'You!' said James; 'but for me--it is like to be the library and the Round Tower again.'

'Scarcely,' said Bedford, 'the Beauforts will never rest till Joan is on a throne.'

James smiled.

'Ay,' said Bedford, 'the Bishop of Winchester will be no small power, you will find.  Would
that I could throw up this France and come home, for he and Humfrey will clash for ever.  James,
an you love me, see Humfrey alone, and remind him that all the welfare of Harry's child may
hang on his forbearance--on union with the Bishop.  Tell him, if he ever loved the noblest
brother that ever lived, to rein himself in, and live only for the child's good, not his own.
Tell him that Bedford and Gloucester must be nothing henceforth--only heads and hands doing
Harry's will for his babe.  Oh, James, what can you tell Humfrey that will make him put himself
aside?'

'You have writ to him Harry's words as to Dame Jac?'

'The wanton! ay, I have; and if you can whisper in his ear that matter of Malcolm and the signet,
it might lessen his inclination.  But,' he sighed, 'I have little hope, James; I see nothing
for Lancaster but that which the old man at York invoked upon us!'

'Yet, when I look at you and Humfrey, and think of the contrast with my own father's brethren,
I see nothing but hope and promise for England,' said James.

'We must do our best, however heavy-hearted,' said John of Bedford, pausing in his walk, and
standing steadfast.  'The rod becomes a palm to those who do not freshly bring it on themselves.
May this poor child of Harry's be bred up so that he may be fit to meet evil or good!'

'Poor child,' repeated James.  'Were he not there, and you--'

'Peace, James,' said Bedford; 'it is well that such a weight is not added!  While I act for
my nephew, I know my duty; were it for myself, methinks I should be crazed with doubts and
questions.  Well,' as a messenger came up with tidings that all was ready, 'fare thee well,
Jamie.  In you I lose the only man with whom I can speak my mind, or take counsel.  You'll
not let me gain a foe, as well as lose a friend, when you get home?'

'Never, in heart, John!' said the King.  'As to hand--Scotland must be to England what she
will have her.  Would that I saw my way thither!  Windsor will have lost all that made captivity
well-nigh sweet.  And so farewell, dear brother.  I thank you for the granting to me of this
sacred charge.'

And so, with hands clasped and wrung together, with tears raining from James's eyes, and a
dry settled melancholy more sad than tears on John's countenance, the two friends parted, never
again to meet; each to run a course true, brave, and short--extinguished the one in bitter
grief, the other in blood.

On All Saints' Day, while James stood with Humfrey of Gloucester at the head of the grave at
Westminster, where Henry's earthly form was laid to rest amid the kings his fathers, amid the
wail of a people as sorrowful as if they knew all the woes that were to ensue, Bedford was
in like manner standing over a grave at the Royal Abbey of St. Denis.  He, the victor's brother,
represented all the princely kindred of Charles VI. of France, and, with his heart at Westminster,
filled the chief mourner's place over the king who had pined to death for his conqueror.

The same infant was proclaimed king over each grave--heir to France and England, to Valois
and Lancaster.  Poor child, his real heirloom was the insanity of the one and the doom of the
other!  Well for him that there was within him that holy innocence that made his life a martyrdom!

CHAPTER XVI: THE CAGE OPEN

More than a year had passed, and it was March when Malcolm was descending the stone stair that
leads so picturesquely beneath the archway of its tower up to the hall of the college of St.
Mary Winton, then really New College.  He had been residing there with Dr. Bennet, associating
with the young members of the foundation educated at Winchester, and studying with all the
freshness of a recent institution.  It had been a very happy time for him, within the gray
stone walls that pleasantly recalled Coldingham, though without Coldingham's defensive aspect,
and with ample food for the mind, which had again returned to its natural state of inquiring
reflection and ardour for knowledge.

Daily Malcolm woke early, attended Matins and Mass in the chapel, studied grammar and logic,
mastered difficult passages in the Fathers, or copied out portions for himself in the chamber
which he as a gentleman commoner, as we should call him, possessed, instead of living in a
common dormitory with the other scholars.  Or in the open cloister he listened and took notes
of the lectures of the fellows and tutors of the college, and seated on a bench or walking
up and down received special instructions. Then ensued the meal, spread in the hall; the period
of recreation, in the meadows, or in the licensed sports, or on the river; fresh studies, chapel,
and a social but quiet evening over the supper in the hall.  All this was varied by Latin sermons
at St. Mary's, or disputations and lectures by notable doctors, and public arguments between
scholars, by which they absolutely fought out their degrees.  There were few colleges as yet,
and those resident in them were the elite; beyond, there was a great mob of scholars living
in rooms as they could, generally very poor, and often very disorderly; but they did not mar
the quiet semi-monastic stillness within the foundations, and to Malcolm it seemed as if the
truly congenial home was opened.

The curriculum of science began to reveal itself to him with all the stages so inviting to
a mind conscious of power and longing for cultivation.  The books, the learned atmosphere,
the infinite possibilities, were delightful to him, and opened a more delightful future.  His
metaphysical Scottish mind delighted in the scholastic arguments that were now first set before
him, and his readiness, appreciation, and eager power of acquiring surprised his teachers,
and made him the pride of New College.

When he looked back at his year of court and camp, he could only marvel at having ever preferred
them.  In war his want of bodily strength would make real distinction impossible; here he felt
himself excelling; here was absolute enjoyment, and of a kind without drawback.  Scholarship
must be his true element and study: the deep universal study of the sisterhood of science that
the University offered was his veritable vocation.  Surely it was not without significance
that the ring that shone on his finger betrothed him to Esclairmonde, the Light of the World;
for though in person the maiden was never to be his own, she was the emblem to him of the pure
virgin light of truth and wisdom that he would be for ever wooing, and winning only to see
further lights beyond.  Human nature felt a pang at the knowledge that he was bound to deliver
up the ring and resign his connection with that fair and stately maiden; but the pain that
had been sore at first had diminished under the sense that he stood in a post of generous trust,
and that his sacrifice was the passport to her grateful esteem.  He knew her to be with Lady
Montagu, awaiting a vacancy at St. Katharine's, and this would be the signal for dissolving
the contract of marriage, after which his present vision was to bestow Lilias upon Patrick,
make over his estates to them, take minor orders, and set forth for Italy, there to pursue
those deeper studies in theology and language for which Padua and Bologna were famous.  It
was many months since he had heard of Lilias; but this did not give him any great uneasiness,
for messengers were few, and letter-writing far from being a common practice.  He had himself
written at every turning-point of his life, and sent his letters when the King communicated
with Scotland; but from his sister he had heard nothing.

He had lately won his first degree as Bachelor of Arts, and was descending the stair from the
Hall after a Lenten meal on salt fish, when he saw below him the well-known figure of King
James's English servant, who doffing his cap held out to him a small strip of folded paper,
fastened by a piece of crimson silk and the royal seal.  It only bore the words:--

   'To our right trusty and well-beloved Cousin the Lord Malcolm Stewart
   of Glenuskie this letter be taken.

   'DEAR COUSIN,

   'We greet you well, and pray you to come to us without loss of time,
   having need of you, we being a free man and no captive.

   'Yours,
   'JAMES R.

   'Written at the Castle of Windsor this St. David's Day, 1424.'

'A free man:' the words kept ringing in Malcolm's ears while he hastened to obtain license
from Warden John Bonke, and to take leave of Dr. Bennet.  He had not left Oxford since the
beginning of his residence there.  Vacations were not general dispersions when ways and means
of transit were so scarce and tardy, and Malcolm had been long without seeing his king.  Joy
on his sovereign's account, and his country's, seemed to swallow up all other thoughts; as
to himself, when he bade his friends and masters farewell, he declared it was merely for a
time, and when they shook their heads and augured otherwise, he replied: 'Nay, think you I
could live in the Cimmerian darkness yonder, dear sirs?  Our poor country hath nothing better
than mere monastery schools, and light of science having once shone on me, I cannot but dwell
in her courts for ever!  Soon shall I be altogether her son and slave!'

Nevertheless, Malcolm was full of eagerness, and pressed on rapidly through the lanes between
Oxford and Windsor, rejoicing to find himself amid the noble trees of the forest, over which
arose in all its grandeur the Castle and Round Tower, as beautiful though less unique than
now, and bearing on it the royal standard, for the little King was still nursed there.

Under the vaulted gateway James--with Patrick and Bairdsbrae behind him--met Malcolm, and threw
his arms round him, crying: 'Ay, kiss me, boy; 'tis a king and no caitiff you kiss now!  Another
six weeks, and then for the mountain and the moor and the bonnie north countree.'

'And why not for a month?' was Malcolm's question, as hand and eye and face responded heartily.

'Why?  Why, because moneys must be told down, and treaties signed; ay, and Lent is no time
for weddings, nor March for southland roses to travel to our cold winds.  Ay, Malcolm, you
see a bridegroom that is to be!  Did you think I was going home without her?'

'I did not think you would be in such glee even at being free, my lord, if you were.'

'And now, Malcolm, ken ye of ony fair Scottish lassie--a cousin of mine ain, who could be had
to countenance my bride at our wedding, and ride with us thereafter to Scotland?'

'I know whom your Grace means,' said Malcolm, smiling.

'An if you do, maybe, Malcolm, sin she bides not far frae the border, ye'd do me the favour
of riding with Sir Patrick here, and bringing her to the bridal,' said the King, making his
accent more home-like and Scottish than Malcolm had ever heard it before.

The happiness of that spring afternoon was surpassing.  The King linked his arm into Malcolm's,
and walked up and down with him on the slopes, telling him all that had led to this consummation;
how Walter Stewart and his brothers had become so insolent and violent as to pass the endurance
of their father the Regent, as well as of all honest Scots; and how, after secret negotiations
and vain endeavours to obtain from him a pledge of indemnity for all that had happened, the
matter had been at length opened with Gloucester, Beaufort, and the Council.  The Scottish
nation, with Albany at the head, was really recalling the King.  This was the condition on
which Henry V. had always declared that he should be liberated; these were the terms on which
he had always hoped to return; and his patience was at last rewarded.  Bedford had sent his
joyful consent, and all was now concluded.  James was really free, and waited only for his
marriage.

'I would not tell you, Malcolm, while there might yet be a slip between cup and lip,' said
the King; 'it might have hindered the humanities; and yet I needed you as much when I was glad
as when all seemed like to fail!'

'You had Patrick,' said Malcolm.

'Patrick's a tall and trusty fellow,' said the King, 'with a shrewd wit, and like to be a right-hand
man; but there's something in you, Malcolm, that makes a man turn to you for fellow-feeling,
even as to a wife.'

Nevertheless, the King and Patrick had grown much attached to each other, though the latter,
being no lover of books, had wearied sorely of the sojourn at Windsor, which the King himself
only found endurable by much study and reflection.  Their only variety had been keeping Christmas
at Hertford with Queen Catherine; 'sorry pastime,' as Drummond reported it to him, though gladdened
to the King by Joan Beaufort's presence, in all her charms.

'The Demoiselle of Luxemburg was there too, statelier than ever,' said James.  'She is now
at Middleham Castle, with the Lady Montagu, and you might make it your way northward, and lodge
a night there.  If you can win her consent, it were well to be wedded when we are.'

'Never shall I, my lord.  I should not dare even to speak of it.'

'It is well; but, Malcolm, you merit something from the damsel.  You are ten times the man
you were when she flouted you.  If women were not mostly witless, you would be much to be preferred
to any mere Ajax or Fierabras; and if this damsel should have come to the wiser mind that it
were pity to be buried to the world--'

'Sir, I pray you say no more.  I were forsworn to ask such a thing.'

'I bid you not, only I would I were there to see that all be not lost for want of a word in
season; and it is high time that something be done. Here be letters from my Lord of Therouenne,
demanding the performance of the contract ere our return home.'

'He cannot reach her here,' said Malcolm.

'No; but his outcry can reach your honour; and it were ill to have such a house as that of
Luxemburg crying out upon you for breach of faith to their daughter.'

Malcolm smiled.  'That I should heed little, Sir.  I would fain bear something for her.'

'Why, this is mere sublimated devoir, too fine for our gross understandings,' said James, ironically.
'Mayhap the sight of the soft roseate cheek may bring it somewhat down to poor human flesh
and blood once more.'

'Once I was tempted, Sir,' said Malcolm, blushing deeply; 'but did I not know that her holiness
is the guardian of her earthly beauty, I would not see her again.'

'Nay, there I command you,' said the King; 'soon I shall have subjects enough; but while I
have but half a dozen, I cannot be disobeyed by them! I bid you go to Middleham, and there
I leave all to the sight.'

The King spoke gaily, and with such kind good-humour that Malcolm, humiliated by the thought
of the past, durst not make fresh asseverations.  James, in the supreme moment of the pure
and innocent romance of which he was the hero, looked on love like his own as the highest crown
of human life, and distrusted the efforts after the superhuman which too often were mere simulation
or imitation; but a certain recollection of Henry's warnings withheld him from pressing the
matter, and he returned to his own joys and hopes, looking on the struggles he expected with
a strong man's exulting joy, and not even counting the years of his captivity wasted, though
they had taken away his first youth.

'What should I have been,' he said, 'bred up in the tumults at home?  What could I have known
better than Perth?  Nay, had I been sent home when I came to age, as a raw lad, how would one
or other by fraud or force have got the upper hand, so as I might never have won it back. 
No, I would not have foregone one year of study--far less that campaign in France, and the
sight of Harry in war and in policy.'

James also took Malcolm to see the child king, his little master.  This, the third king of
James's captivity, was now a fair creature of two years old.  He trotted to meet his visitor,
calling him by a baby name for brother, and stretching out his arms to be lifted up and fondled;
for, as Dame Alice Boteller, his gouvernante, muttered, he knew the King of Scots better than
he did his own mother.

A retinue had been already collected, and equipments prepared, so that there was no delay in
sending forth Malcolm and Patrick upon their northward journey.  At the nearest town they halted,
sending forward a messenger to announce their neighbourhood to the old Countess of Salisbury
and her grand-daughter Lady Montagu, and to request permission to halt for 'Mothering Sunday'
at the Castle.

In return a whole band of squires and retainers came forth, headed by the knightly seneschal,
to invite Lord Malcolm Stewart and his companion to the Castle; whereupon Sir Patrick proceeded
to don his gayest gown and chaperon, and was greatly scandalized that Malcolm's preparation
consisted in putting on his black serge bachelor's gown and hood of rabbit's fur such as he
wore at Oxford, looking, as Patrick declared, no better than a begging scholar.  But Malcolm
had made up his mind that if he appeared before Esclairmonde at all it should be in no other
guise; and thus it was that he rode like a black spot in the midst of the cavalcade, bright
with the colours of Nevil and of Montagu, and was marshalled up the broad stairs by the silver
wand of the seneschal.

Lord Montagu had gone back to the wars; so the family at home consisted of the grand, stately,
and distant old Countess of Salisbury, and her young grand-daughter, the Lady Montagu, with
her three months' old son. Each had an almost royal suite of well-born dames and damsels in
attendance, among whom the Demoiselle de Luxemburg alone was on an equality with the mistresses
of the house.  Even Queen Catherine's presence-chamber had hardly equalled the grand baronial
ceremony of the hall, where sat the three ladies in the midst of their circle of attendants,
male and female ranged on opposite sides; and old Lady Salisbury knew the exact number of paces
that it befitted her and Lady Montagu to advance to receive the royal infusion of blood that
flowed in the veins of my Lord of Glenuskie.  And yet it was the cheek, and not the hand, that
were offered in salutation by both ladies, as well as by Esclairmonde.  Malcolm, however, only
durst kneel on one knee and salute her hand, and felt himself burning with crimson as the touch
and voice brought back those longings that, as James had said, proved him human still.  He
was almost glad that etiquette required him to hand the aged Countess to her seat and to devote
his chief attention to her.

Punctilio reigned supreme in such a house as this.  Nowhere had Malcolm seen such observance
of ceremony, save in the court of the Duke of Burgundy, and there it was modified by the presence
of rough and ready warriors; but an ancient dame like Lady Salisbury thought it both the due
and the safeguard of her son's honour, and exacted it rigorously of all who approached her.

Alice of Montagu had the sweet fragile look of a young mother about her, but her frightened
fawn air was gone; she was in her home, had found her place, and held it with a simple dignity
of her own, quite ready to ripen into all the matronly authority, without the severe formality,
of her grand-dame.

She treated Malcolm with a gentle smiling courtesy such as she had never vouchsafed to him
before, and all the shyness that had once made her silent was gone, when at the supper-table,
and afterwards seated around the fire, the tidings of the camp and court were talked over with
all the zest of those to whom King Harry's last campaign was becoming 'old times'; and what
with her husband's letters and opinions, little Alice was really the best-informed as to the
present state of things. Esclairmonde took her part in the conversation, but there was no opportunity
of exchanging a private or personal word between her and Malcolm in a party of five, where
one was as vigilant and grave-eyed as my Lady Salisbury.

However, the next was a peculiar day, the Fourth Sunday in Lent, called 'Mothering Sunday'
because on that day it was originally the custom for offerings to be carried from all the country
round to the cathedral or mother church on that day.  This custom had been modified, but it
was still the rule that all the persons, who at other times worshipped at the nearest monastery
chapel or at a private chapel in their own houses, should on that day repair to their parish
church, and there make a special offering at the Mass--that offering which has since become
the Easter dues.  It was a festival Sunday too--'Refreshing Sunday'--then, as now, marked by
the Gospel on the feeding of the multitude; and from this, as well as from the name, the pretty
custom had begun of offering the mother of each house her rich simnal cake, with some other
gift from each of her children.

Hearing a pattering of feet in the early morning, Malcolm looked out and beheld a whole troop
of small children popping in and out of a low archway.  If he could have peeped in, he would
have known how many simnals Ladies Esclairmonde and Alice were sending down--with something
more substantial--to be given to mothers by the children who as yet had nothing to bring of
their own.

But when the household assembled in the castle hall, they did see fair young Lady Montagu kneel
at the chair of the grave old Countess, and hold up a silver dish, wherein lay the simnal,
mixed, kneaded, and moulded by her own hands, and bearing on it a rich ruby clasp, sent by
her father, the Earl, as his special gift to his mother on this Sunday.

And then, when the old lady, with glistening eyes, had spoken her blessing on the fair young
head bent down before her, and the grandchild rose up, there was the pretty surprise for her
of her little swaddled son, lying in Esclairmonde's arms, and between the small fingers, that
as yet knew not how to grasp, the tiny simnal; and moreover a fair pearl devised in like manner
by the absent Sir Richard as a gift for his wife's first 'Mothering Sunday.'  There was no
etiquette here to hinder sweet Alice from passionately clasping her child, and covering him
with kisses, as many for his father as for himself, as she laughed at the baby smiles and helpless
gestures of the future king-maker, whose ambition and turbulence were to be the ruin of that
fair and prosperous household, and bring the gentle Alice to a widowed, bereaved, and attainted
old age.

Well that none there present saw the future, as she proudly claimed the admiration of Malcolm
for her babe!

She was equipped for the expedition to the parish church, as likewise were Esclairmonde and
almost all the rest; but the aged Countess could not encounter the cold March winds, and had
a dispensation; and thus Alice, being the lady of the procession, contrived at the same time
to call Sir Patrick to her side, and bid Lord Malcolm lead the Lady Esclairmonde.

For as the weather was dry and cold, Lady Montagu had chosen to go on foot; and a grand procession
it was that she led, of gentlemen and ladies, two and two, in their bright dresses and adornments
that delighted the eyes of the homely yeomen and their wives, flocking in from their homesteads
with baskets of offerings, often in kind.

Meantime, Malcolm, holding the tips of Esclairmonde's fingers, durst not speak till she began:
'This is a devout and pious household--full of peace and good government.'

'And your time goes happily here?' asked Malcolm.

'Yes, it has been a peaceful harbour wherein to wait,' said Esclairmonde. 'And even if Alice
were called to her husband in France, my Lady Countess will keep me with her till there be
a vacancy for me at St. Katharine's.'

'Have you the promise from Queen Joan?'

'Yes,' replied Esclairmonde.  'The Countess had been a lady of hers, and wrought with her,
so that whenever the post of bedeswoman is in her gift I shall be preferred to it.'

'You, the heiress, accept the charity!' Malcolm could not help exclaiming.

'The better for all remnants of pride,' returned the lady.  'And you, my lord, has it fared
well with you?'

Malcolm, happy in her interest, poured forth all that he had to tell, and she listened as Esclairmonde
alone could listen.  There was something in her very expression of attention that seemed to
make the speaker take out the alloy and leave only his purest gold to meet her ears.  Malcolm
forgot those throbs of foolish wild hope that had shot across him like demon temptations to
hermit saints, and only felt that the creature of his love and reverence was listening benignly
as he told her of the exceeding delight that he was unravelling in learned lore; how each step
showed him further heights, and how he had come to view the Light of the World as the light
of wisdom, to the research of which he meant to devote his entire life, among universities
and manuscripts.

'The Light of Wisdom,' repeated Esclairmonde--'so it may be, for Christ is Heavenly Wisdom;
but I doubt me if the Light of the World lies solely in books and universities.'

'Nay,' said Malcolm.  'Once I was fool enough to fancy it was the light of glory, calling knights
to deeds of fame and chivalry.  I have seen mine error now, and--oh, lady, what mean you? where
should that light be, save in the writings of wise and holy men?'

'Methinks,' said Esclairmonde, 'that the light is there, even as the light is also before the
eyes of the true knight; but it is not only there.'

'Where is it then?' said Malcolm.  'In helmet or in cowl, I am the sworn champion of the Light
of the World.'

'The Light,' said Esclairmonde, looking upwards, 'the true Light of the World is the Blessed
Saviour, the Heavenly Wisdom of God; and His champions find Him and serve Him in camp, cloister,
or school, or wherever He has marked their path, so as they seek not their own profit or glory,
and lay not up their treasure for themselves on earth.'

'Then surely,' said Malcolm, 'the hoards of deep study within the mind are treasures beyond
the earth.'

'Your schoolmen speak of spirit, mind, and body,' said Esclairmonde--'at least so I, an ignorant
woman, have been told.  Should not the true Light for eternity lighten the spirit rather than
the mind?'

Malcolm pondered and said: 'I thought I had found the right path at last!'

'Nay--never, never did I say otherwise,' cried Esclairmonde.  'To seek God's Light in good
men's words, and pursue it, must be a blessed task. Every task must be blessed to which He
leads.  And when you are enlightened with that light, you will hold it up to others.  When
you have found the treasure, you will scatter it here, and so lay it up above.'

Esclairmonde's words were almost a riddle to Malcolm, but his reverence for her made him lay
them up deeply, as he watched her kneeling at the Mass, her upturned face beaming with an angelic
expression.

His mind was much calmed by this meeting.  It had had an absolutely contrary effect to what
King James had expected, by spiritualizing his love, and increasing that reverence which cast
out its earthliness.  That first throb which had been so keen at meeting, and knowing her not
for him, had passed away in the refining of that distant worship he had paid her in those days
of innocence.

Lady Montagu was quite satisfied with him now.  He was the Malcolm of her first acquaintance,
only without his foolish diffidence, and with a weight and earnestness that made him a man
and not a boy; and she cordially invited him to bring his sister with him, and rest, on the
way southward.  He agreed most thankfully, since this would be the only opportunity of showing
Esclairmonde and Lilias one to the other, as well as one of his own few chances of seeing Esclairmonde.

Once they must meet, that their promises might be restored the one to the other; but as the
betrothal remained the lady's security, this could not be done till she became pledged at St.
Katharine's.  When the opportunity came, she was to send Malcolm a messenger, and he would
come to her at once.  Until then he promised that he would not leave Great Britain.

On Monday the cousins proceeded, coming after a time to the route by which Malcolm had ridden
three years before, and where he was now at home in comparison with Patrick.  How redolent
it was with recollections of King Harry, in all his gaiety and grace, ere the shock of his
brother's death had fallen on him!  At Thirsk, Malcolm told of the prowess and the knighthood
of honest Trenton and Kitson, to somewhat incredulous ears. The two squires had been held as
clownish fellows, and the sentiment of the country was that Mistress Agnes was well quit of
them, and the rough guardianship by which they had kept off all other suitors.  As mine host
concluded, ''Tis a fine thing to go to the wars.'

Hearing that Kitson's mother lived not a mile out of his way, Malcolm rode to the fine old
moated grange, where he found her sitting at her spinning, presiding over a great plentiful
household, while her second son, a much shrewder-looking man than Sir Christopher, managed
the farm.

The travellers were welcomed with eager hospitality so soon as it was understood that they
brought tidings of 'our Kit'; and Malcolm's story was listened to with tears of joy by the
old lady, while the brother could not get over his amazement at hearing that Trenton and Kitson
had become a proverb in the camp for oneness in friendship.

'Made it up with Will Trenton!  And never fought it out!  I'd never know our Kit again after that!'

His steady bravery, his knighthood, and the King's praise, his having assisted in saving Lord
Glenuskie's life against such odds, did not seem to strike Wilfred Kitson half as much as the
friendship with Trenton, and Malcolm did not think the regret was very great at the two knights
having given up their intention of returning.  'Our Kit's' place seemed to have closed up behind
him; Wilfred seemed to be too much master to be ready to give up to the elder brother; and
even the mother had learnt to do without him.  'I'll warrant,' quoth she, 'that now he is a
knight and got used to fine French ways, he'll think nothing good enow for him.  And if he
brought Will Trenton with him, I'd not sit at the board with the fellow.--But ye'll ride over,
Wilfred, and take care the minx Agnes knows what she's lost.  Ay, and if you knew of a safe
hand, Sir, when the shearing is over I'd send the lad a purse of nobles to keep up his knighthood
in the camp, forsooth.'

'Certes,' said Malcolm, as after a salt-fish dinner he mounted again, 'if honest Kitson knew,
he would scarce turn back from the camp, where he is somebody.  Shall we find ourselves as
little wanted when we get home, Patie?'

Patrick drew himself up with a happy face of secret assurance.  Nothing could make Lilias forsake
him, he well knew.

At Durham they found their good friend Father Akefield, erst Prior of Coldingham, but who had
been violently dispossessed by the House of Albany in favour of their candidate, Drax, about
a year before, and was thankful to have been allowed with a few English monks to retire across
the Border to the mother Abbey at Durham.

The good father could hardly believe his eyes when he beheld Malcolm, now a comely and personable
young gentleman, less handsome and graceful indeed than many, but with all his painful personal
peculiarities gone, with none of the scared, imploring look, but with a grave thoughtful earnestness
about his face, as though all that once was timid and wandering was now fixed and steadfast.

Father Akefield could tell nothing of Lilias since his own expulsion, but as the Prioress of
St. Abbs was herself a Drummond, and no one durst interfere with her, he had no alarms for
her safety.  But he advised the two gentlemen to go straight to St. Abbs, without showing themselves
at Coldingham, lest Prior Drax, being in the Albany interest, should make any demur at giving
her up to the care of the brother, who still wanted some months of his twenty-first year.

Accordingly they pushed on, and in due time slept at Berwick, receiving civilities from the
English governor that chafed Patrick's blood, which became inflammable as soon as he neared
the Border; and rising early the next morning, they passed the gates, and were on Scottish
ground once more, their hearts bounding at the sense that it was their own land, and would
soon be no more a land of misrule.  With their knowledge of King James and his intentions,
well might they have unlimited hopes for the country over which he was about to reign.

They turned aside from Coldingham, and made for the sea, and at length the promontory of St.
Abbs Head rose before them; they passed through the outer buildings intended as shelter for
the attendants of ladies coming to the nunnery, and knocked at the gateway.

A wicket in the door was opened, and the portress looked out through a grating.

'Benedicite, good Sister,' said Malcolm.  'Prithee tell the Mother Abbess that Malcolm Stewart
of Glenuskie is here from the King, and craves to speak with her and the Lady Lilias.'

'Lord Malcolm!  Lady Lilias!  St. Ebba's good mercy!' shrieked the affrighted portress.  They
heard her rushing headlong across the court, and looked on one another in consternation.

Patrick betook himself to knocking as if he would beat down the door, and Malcolm leant against
it with a foreboding that took away his breath--dreading the moment when it should be opened.

The portress and her keys returned again, and parleyed a moment.  'You are the Lord Malcolm
in very deed--in the flesh?'

'Wherefore not?' demanded Malcolm.

'Nay, but we heard ye were slain, my lord,' explained the portress--letting him in, however,
and leading them across the court, to where the Mother Abbess, Annabel Drummond, awaited them
in the parlour.

'Alas, Sirs, what grievous error has this been?' was her exclamation; while Malcolm, scarcely
waiting for salutation, demanded, 'Where is my sister?'

'How?  In St. Hilda's keeping at Whitby, whither the King sent for her,' said the Abbess.

'The King!' cried Malcolm, 'we come from the King!  Oh, what treachery has been here?'

'And you, Lord Malcolm--and you, my kinsman, Sir Patrick of the Braes, how do I see you here?
We had heard you both were dead.'

'You heard a lying tale then, good Mother,' said Patrick, gruffly, 'no doubt devised for the
misery of the--of my--'  He could not finish the sentence, and Malcolm entreated the Abbess
to tell the whole.

It appeared that about a year previously the chaplain of the monastery had learnt at Coldingham
that Sir John Swinton of Swinton had sent home tidings that Patrick Drummond had been thrown
from his horse and left behind in a village which the English had harried, and as he could
not move, he was sure to have been either burnt or hung.  This conclusion was natural, and
argued no malice in the reporter; and while poor Lilias was still in her first agony of grief,
Prior Drax sent over intelligence derived from the Duke of Albany himself that Malcolm Stewart
of Glenuskie had been stabbed in the forest of Vincennes.  This report Malcolm himself accounted
for.  He had heard a Scots tongue among his foes, though national feeling had made him utterly
silent on that head to the Duke of Bedford, and he guessed it to belong to a certain M'Kay,
whose clan regarded themselves as at feud with the Stewarts, and of whom he had heard as living
a wild routier life.  He had probably been hired by Ghisbert for the attack, and had returned
home and spread the report of its success.

Some few weeks later, the Abbess Annabel continued, there had arrived two monks from Coldingham,
with an escort, declaring themselves to have received orders from King James to transport the
Lady Lilias to the nunnery at Whitby, where the Abbess had promised to receive her, till he
could determine her fate.

The forlorn and desolate Lilias, believing herself to stand alone in the world, was very loth
to quit her shelter and her friends at St. Abbs; but the Abbess, doubting her own ability to
protect her from the rapacious grasp of Walter Stewart, now that she had, as she believed,
become an heiress, and glad to avert from her house the persecution that such protection would
bring upon it, had gratefully heard of this act of consideration on the King's part, and expedited
her departure. A half rank there was not unbelievable guards. There, in was the doles that he took themselves

as him asked the tidings.


Timidly--yes; for the awful chances heavily oppressed him; and the horrible scurrility and
savagery that greeted him on all sides made his heart faint at the thought of his Lily in this
cage of foul animals.  He did not fear for himself, and never paused until a shouting circle
of idle ruffians set themselves full in his way, to badger and bait the poor scholar with taunts
and insults--hemming him in, bawling out ribald mirth, as a pack of hounds fall on some stray
dog, or, as Malcolm thought, in a moment half of sick horror, half of resolute resignation,
like wild cattle--fat bulls of Bashan closing in on every side.  So horrible a moment of distress
he had never known; but suddenly, as he stood summoning all his strength, panting with dismay,
inwardly praying, and trying to close his ears and commend himself to One who knew what mockery
is, there was an opening of the crowd, a youth darted down among them, with a loud cry of 'Shame!
Out on you!  A poor scholar!' and taking Malcolm's hand, led him forward; while a laugh of
mockery rose in the distance--'Like to like.'

'Ay, my friend and brother, I am Baccalaureus, even as you are,' eagerly said the young gentleman,
in whom Malcolm, somewhat to his alarm, recognized his cousin, James Kennedy, the King's nephew,
a real Parisian 'bejanus,' or bec jaune, {2} when they last had met in the Hotel de St. Pol;
and thus not only qualified to confute and expose him, should he show any ignorance of details,
but also much more likely to know him than those who had not seen him for many months before
he had left Scotland.

But James Kennedy asked no questions, only said kindly, in the Latin that was always spoken
in the University, 'Pray pardon us!  Mores Hyperboreis desunt. {3}  The Regent would be grieved,
if he knew how these scelerati {4} have sorted you.  Come, rest and wash--it will soon be supper-time.'

He took Malcolm to an inner court, filled for him a cup of ale, for his immediate refreshment,
and led him to a spout of clear water, in the side of the rock on which the Castle stood; where
a stone basin afforded the only facilities for washing that the greater part of the inhabitants
of the Castle expected, and, in effect, more than they commonly used. Malcolm, however, was
heartily glad of the refreshment of removing the dust from his weary face and feet--and heartily
thanked his protector, in the same dog-Latin.  Kennedy waited for him, and as a great bell
began to ring, said 'Pro caena,' {5} and conducted him towards the great hall while Malcolm
felt much impelled to make himself known, but was conscious that he had not so comported himself
towards his cousin at Paris as to deserve much favour from him.

A high table was spread in the hall, with the usual appliances befitting princes and nobles.
The other tables, below the dais, were of the rudest description, and stained with accumulations
of grease and ale; and no wonder, since trenchers were not, and each man hacked a gobbet for
himself from the huge pieces of beef carried round on spits--nor would the guests have had
any objection, during a campaign, to cook the meat in the fashion described by Froissart, between
themselves and the saddle. These were the squirearchy; Malcolm's late persecutors did not aspire
to the benches around these boards, or only at second hand, and for the most part had no seat
but the unclean straw and rushes that strewed the floor.

As James Kennedy entered the hall with Malcolm, there came from another door, marshalled by
the seneschal in full feudal state, the Regent Duke of Albany himself, his wife, a daughter
or two, two sons--and Malcolm saw, with beating heart, Lilias herself, pale worn, sorrowful-looking,
grievously altered, but still his own Lily.  Others followed, chiefly knights and attendants,
but Malcolm saw no one but Lily.  She took her place dejectedly, and never raised her eyes
towards him, even when, on the Regent's question, 'What have ye there, Jamie?'  Kennedy stood
forth and answered that it was a scholar, a student, for whom he asked the hospitality of his
kinsman.

'He is welcome,' said the Regent, a man of easy good-nature, whose chief misfortune was, that
being of weak nature, he came between a wicked father and wickeder sons.  He was a handsome
man, with much of the stately appearance of King James himself, and the same complexion; but
it was that sort of likeness which was almost provoking, by seeming to detract from the majesty
of the lineaments themselves, as seen in him who alone knew how to make them a mask for a great
soul.  His two sons, Robert and Alexander, laughed as they saw Kennedy's companion, and called
out, 'So that's the brotherhood of learning, is it, Jamie?--forgathering with any beggar in
the street!'

'Yea,' said Kennedy, nothing daunted, 'and finding him much better mannered than you!'

'Ay!' sighed Murdoch, feebly; 'when I grew up, it was at the Castles of Perth and Doune that
we looked for the best manners.  Now--'

'We leave them to the lick-platters that have to live by them,' said Alexander, rudely.

Kennedy, meanwhile, gave the young scholar in charge to a gray-headed retainer, who seemed
one of the few who had any remains of good-breeding; and then offered to say Grace--he being
the nearest approach to an ecclesiastic present--as the chaplain was gone to an Easter festivity
at his Abbey.  Malcolm thus obtained a seat at the second table, and a tolerable share of supper;
but he could hardly eat, from intense anxiety, and scarcely knew whether to be glad or sorry
that he was out of sight of Lily.

By and by, a moment's lull of the universal din enabled Malcolm to hear the Regent saying,
'Verily, there is a look of gentle nurture about the lad.  Look you, James, when the tables
are drawn, you shall hold a disputation with him.  It will be sport to hear how you chop logic
at your Universities yonder.'

Malcolm's spirit sank.  Such disputations were perfectly ordinary work at both Oxford and Paris,
and, usually, he was quite capable of sustaining his part in them; but his heart was so full,
his mind so anxious, his condition so dangerous, that he felt as if he could by no means rally
that alertness of argument, and readiness of quotation, that were requisite even in the merest
tyro.  However, he made a great effort.  He secretly invoked the Light of Wisdom; tried to
think himself back into the aisles of St. Mary's Church, and to call up the key-notes of some
of the stock arguments; hoping that, if the selection of the subject were left to Kennedy,
he would hit on one of those most familiar at Oxford.

The supper was ended, the tables were removed, and the challenge took place.  Duke Murdoch,
leaning back in his high chair by the peat-fire, while the ladies sat round at their spinning,
called for the two young clerks to begin their tourney of words.  They stood opposite one another,
on the step of the dais; and Kennedy, as host and challenger, assigned to his opponent the
choice of a subject, when Malcolm, brightening, proposed one that he had so often heard and
practised on, as to have the arguments at his fingers' ends; namely, that the real consists
only in that which is substantial to the senses, and which we see, hear, taste, smell, or touch.

Kennedy's shrewd gray eye glanced at him in a manner that startled him, as he made reply, 'Fellow-alumnus,
you speak as Oxford scholars speak; but I rede ye well that the real is not that which is grossly
tangible to the corporeal sense, but the idea that is conceived within the immortal intelligence.'

The argument was carried on in the vernacular, but there was an unlimited license of quotation
from authors of all kinds, classics, Fathers, and schoolmen.  It was like a game at chess,
in which the first moves were always so much alike, that they might have been made by automatons;
and Malcolm was repeating reply and counter-reply, almost by rote, when a citation brought
in by Kennedy again startled him.

'Outward things,' said James, 'are the mere mark; for have we not heard how

   "Telephus et Peleus, quum pauper et exsul uterque,
   Projicit ampullas et sesquipedalia verba"?' {6}

Was this to prove that he recognized a wandering prince in his opponent? thought Malcolm; but,
much on his guard, he made answer, as usual, in his native tongue.  'That which is not touched
and held is but a vain and fleeting shadow--"solvitur in nube." {7}

'Negatur, it is denied!' said Kennedy, fixing his eyes full upon him. 'The Speculum of the
Soul, which is immortal, retains the image even while the bodily presence is far away.  Wherefore
else was it that Ulysses sat as a beggar by his paternal hearth, or that Cadmus wandered to
seek his sister?'

This was anything but the regular illustration--the argument was far too directly ad hominem--and
Malcolm hesitated for a moment, ere framing his reply.  'If the image had satisfied the craving
of their hearts, they had never wandered, nor endangered themselves.'

'Nor,' said Kennedy, 'endeared themselves to all who love the leal and the brave, and count
these indeed as verities for which to live.'

From the manner in which these words were spoken, Malcolm had no further doubt either that
Kennedy knew him, or that he meant to assist him; and the discussion thenceforth proceeded
without further departures from the regular style, and was sustained with considerable spirit,
till the Regent grew weary of it, and bed-time approached, when Kennedy announced his intention
of taking his fellow-student to share his chamber; and, as this did not appear at all an unnatural
proposal, in the crowded Castle, Malcolm followed him up various winding stairs into a small
circular chamber, with a loop-hole window, within one of the flanking towers.

Carefully closing the heavy door, Kennedy held out his hands.  'Fair cousin,' he said, 'this
is bravely done of you.'

'Will it save my sister?' asked Malcolm, anxiously.

'It should,' said his kinsman; 'but how can it be?  Whatever is done, must be ere Walter Stewart
returns.'

'Tell me all!  I know nothing--save that she was cruelly lured from St. Abbs.'

'I know little more,' said Kennedy.  'It was on a false report of your death, and Walter had
well-nigh obtained a forcible marriage; when her resistance and cries to Heaven daunted the
monk who was to have performed the rite, so that he, in a sort, became her protector.  When
she was brought here, Walter swore he would bend her to his will; shut her up in the old keep,
and kept her there, scantily fed, and a close prisoner, while he went forth on one of his forays.
The Regent coming here meantime, found the poor maiden in her captivity, and freed her so far
that she lives, to all appearance, as becomes his kinswoman; but the Duchess is cruelly strict
with her, being resolved, as she says, to take down her pride.'

'They must know that I live,' said Malcolm.

'They do; but Walter is none the less resolved not to be balked.  Things came to a wild pass
a few weeks syne.  The Regent had never dared tell him how far matters had gone for bringing
back the King, when one day Walter came in, clad for hawking; and, in his rudest manner, demanded
the falcon that was wont to sit on his father's wrist, and that had never been taken out by
any other.  The Regent refused to part with the bird, as he had oft done before; whereupon
his son, in his fury, snatched her from his wrist, and wrung her head off before all our eyes;
then turning fiercely on your poor sister, told her that "yon gled should be a token to her,
of how they fared who withheld themselves from him."  Then rose the Duke, trembling within
rage; "Ay, Wat," said he, "ye hae been owermuch for me.  We will soon have ane at home that
will ken how to guide ye."  Walter looked at him insolently, and muttered, "I've heard of this
before!  They that wad have a master, may live under a master--but I'm not ane of them;" and
then, turning upon Lady Lilias, he pointed to the dead hawk, and told her that, unless she
yielded to him with a good grace, that bird showed her what she might expect, long ere the
King or her brother were across the border.'

'And where is he now?'

'In Fife, striving to get a force together to hinder the King's return. He'll not do that;
men are too weary of misrule to join him against King James; but he is like, any day, to come
back with reivers enough to terrify his father, and get your sister into his hands--indeed,
his mother is ready to give her up to him whenever he asks.  He has sworn to have her now,
were it merely to vex the King and you, and show that he is to be daunted neither by man, heaven,
nor hell.'

'And he may come?'

'Any day or any night,' said James.  'Since he went I have striven, in vain, to devise some
escape for your sister; but Heaven has surely sent you to hinder so foul a wrong!  Yet, if
you went to Glenuskie and raised your vassals--'

'It would be loss of time,' said Malcolm; 'and this matter may not be put to the doubtful issue
of a fray between my men and his villains.  Out of this place must she go at once.  But, alas!
how win to the speech of her?'

'That can I do,' said Kennedy.  'For a few brief moments, each day, have I spoken to her in
the chapel.  Nay, I had left this place before now, had she not prayed me to remain as her
only friend.'

'Heaven must requite you, Cousin James,' said Malcolm, warmly.  'I deserved not this of you.'

'All that I desire,' said Kennedy, 'is to see this land of ours cease to be full of darkness
and cruel habitations.  Malcolm, you know the King better than I; may we not trust that he
will come as a redresser of wrongs?'

'Know you not his pledge to himself?--"I will make the key keep the castle, and the bracken
bush keep the cow, though I live the life of a dog to bring it about!"'

'God strengthen his hand,' said Kennedy, with tears in his eyes; 'and bring better days to
our poor land.  Cousin, has not your heart burnt within you, to be doing somewhat to bring
these countrymen of ours to better mind?'

'I have grieved,' said Malcolm.  'The sight has been the woe and horror of my whole life; and
either it is worse now than when I went away, or I see it clearer.'

'It is both,' said Kennedy; 'and, Malcolm, it is borne in on me that we, who have seen better
things, have a heavy charge!  The King may punish marauders, and enforce peace; but it will
be but the rule of the strong hand, unless men's hearts be moved!  Our clergy--they bear the
office of priests--but their fierceness and their ignorance would scarce be believed in France
or England; and how should it be otherwise, with no schools at home save the abbeys--and the
abbeys almost all fortresses held by fierce noblemen's sons?'

Malcolm would much rather have discussed the means of rescuing his sister, but James Kennedy's
heart was full of a youth's ardent plans for the re-awakening of religion in his country, chiefly
through the improved education of the clergy, and it was not easy to bring his discourse to
a close.

'You--you were to wed a great Flemish heiress?' he said.  'You will do your part, Cousin, in
the founding of a University--such as has changed ourselves so greatly.'

Malcolm smiled.  'My only bride is learning,' he said; 'my other betrothal is but in name,
for the safety of the lady.'

'Then,' cried Kennedy joyfully, 'you will give yourself.  Learning and culture turned to God's
service, for this poor country's sake, in one of birth like you, may change her indeed.'

Was this the reading of Esclairmonde's riddle? suddenly thought Malcolm. Was the true search
for heavenly Light, then, to consist in holding up to his countrymen the lamp he was kindling
for himself?  Must true wisdom consist in treasuring knowledge, not for his own honour among
learned men, or the delectation of his own mind, but to scatter it among these rude northern
souls?  Must the vision of learned research and scholarly calm vanish, as cloistral peace,
and chivalrous love and glory, had vanished before? and was the lot of a hard-working secular
priest that which called him?

CHAPTER XVIII: CLERK DAVIE

For Malcolm to speak with his sister was well-nigh an impossibility.  Had he been detected,
he would have been immediately treated as a spy, and the suspicion thus excited would have
been a dangerous preparation for the King as well as for himself; nor was there any pretext
for giving the wandering scholar an interview with her.

But harsh and strict as was the Duchess of Albany--a tall, raw-boned, red- haired woman, daughter
of the fierce old Earl of Lennox--and resolved as she was to bend Lilias by persecution to
accept her son, she could not debar a young gentleman of the royal kindred, like James Kennedy,
from entering the apartment where the ladies of the family sat with their needles; and the
Regent, half from pity, half from shame, had refused to permit Lilias Stewart's being treated
as a mere captive.

Thus Malcolm remained in Kennedy's room in much anxiety, while his cousin went forth to do
his best in his cause, and after some hours returned to him with the tidings that he had succeeded
in letting Lily know that he was in the Castle.  Standing over her while she bent over her
embroidery, and thus concealing her trembling agitation, he had found it possible to whisper
in her ears the tidings of her brother having come to save her, and of hearing her insist that
Malcolm, 'wee Malcolm, must run no peril, but that she would do and dare everything--nay, would
prefer death itself to Walter Stewart.'

'Have you any device in this matter?' demanded James Kennedy, when he had thus spoken.

'Have you your college gown here?' inquired Malcolm.

'I have, in yon kist,' said Kennedy.  'Would you disguise her therein? You and she are nearly
of a height.'

'Ay,' said Malcolm.  'The plot I thought on is this--the worst is that the risk rests with you.'

'That is naught, less than naught,' said Kennedy.  'I had risked myself ten times over had
I seen any hope for her in so doing.'

Malcolm then explained his plan, namely, that if Lilias could have Kennedy's gown conveyed
to her, she should array herself therein, and be conducted out of the castle by her cousin
by one gate, he himself in secular garb going by another, and joining at some place of meeting,
whence, as a pair of brothers, Malcolm and she might gain the English border.

James Kennedy considered, and then added that he could improve on the plan.  He had long intended
leaving Doune for his brother's castle, but only tarried in case he could do anything for Lilias.
He would at supper publicly announce to the Regent his departure for the next day, and also
say that he had detained his fellow-scholar to go within him.  Then arranging for Malcolm's
exit in a secular dress among his escort, as one of the many unobserved loungers, Lilias should
go with him in very early morning in the bachelor's gown, which he would place in a corner
of a dark passage, where she could find it.  Then if Malcolm and she turned aside from his
escort, as the pursuit as soon as her evasion was discovered would be immediately directed
on himself, they would have the more time for escape.

It was a complicated plan, but there was this recommendation, that Malcolm need not lose sight
of his sister.  Clerk as he was, young Kennedy could not ride without an escort, and among
his followers he could place Malcolm.  Accordingly at supper he announced his desire to leave
Doune at dawn next morning, and was, as a matter of course, courteously pressed to remain.
Malcolm in the meantime eluded observation as much as possible while watching his sister, who,
in spite of all her efforts, was pale and red by turns, never durst glance towards him, and
trembled whenever any one went near him.

The ladies at length swept out of the hall, and Robert and Alexander called for more wine for
a rere-supper to drink to James's good journey; but Kennedy tore himself from their hospitable
violence, and again he and Malcolm were alone, spending a night of anxiety and consultation.

Morning came; Malcolm arrayed himself in a somewhat worn dress of Kennedy's, with the belt
and dirk he had carried under his scholar's garb now without, and a steel cap that his cousin
had procured for him on his head.  With a parcel in his arms of Kennedy's gear, he might pass
for a servant sent from home to meet him; and so soon as this disguise was complete, Kennedy
opened the door.  On the turret stair stood a hooded black figure, that started as the door opened.

Malcolm's heart might well seem to leap to his lips, but both brother and sister felt the tension
of nerve that caution required too much to give way for a moment.

Kennedy whispered, 'Your license, fair Cousin,' and passed on with the free step of lordly
birth, while a few paces behind the seeming scholar humbly followed, and Malcolm, putting on
his soldier's tread and the careless free-and-easy bearing he had affected before Meaux, brought
up the rear with Master Kennedy's mails.

As they anticipated, the household was not troubling itself to rise to see the priest off.
Not that this made the coast clear, for the floor of the hall was cumbered with snoring sleepers
in all sorts of attitudes--nay, at the upper table, the flushed, debauched, though young and
handsome, faces of Robert and Alexander Stewart might have been detected among those who lay
snoring among the relics of their last night's revel.

The old steward was, however, up and alert, ready to offer the stirrup- cup, and the horses
were waiting in the court; but what they had by no means expected or desired was that Duke
Murdoch himself, in his long furred gown, came slowly across the hall to bid his young kinsman
Kennedy farewell.

'Speed you well, my lad,' he said kindly.  'I ask ye not to tarry in what ye must deem a graceless
household;' and he looked sadly across at his two sons, boys in age, but seniors in excess.
'I would we had mair lads like you.  I fear me a heavy reckoning is coming.'

'You have ever been good lord to all, Sir,' said Kennedy, affectionately, for he really loved
and pitied the soft-hearted Duke.

'Too good, maybe,' said Murdoch.  'What! the scholar goes with you?' and he fixed a look on
Lily's face that brought the colour deep into it under her hood.

'Yes, Sir,' answered Kennedy, respectfully.  'Here, you Tam,' indicating Malcolm, 'take him
behind you on the sumpter-horse.'

'Fare ye weel, gentle scholar,' said Murdoch, taking the hand that Lily was far from offering.
'May ye win to your journey's end safe and sound; and remember,' he added, holding the fingers
tight, and speaking under the hood, 'if ye have been hardly served, 'twas to make ye the second
lady in Scotland.  Take care of her--him, young laddie,' he added, turning on Malcolm: ''tis
best so; and mind' (he spoke in the same wheedling tone of self-excuse), 'if ye tell the tale
down south, nae ill hath been dune till her, and where could she have been mair fitly than
beneath her kinsman's roof?  I'd not let her go, but that young blude is hot and ill to guide.'

An answer would have been hard to find; and it was well that he did not look for any.  Indeed,
Malcolm could not have spoken without being heard by the seneschal, and therefore could only
bow, take his seat on the baggage-horse, and then feel his sister mounting behind him in an
attitude less unfamiliar on occasion even to the high-born ladies of the fifteenth century
than to those of our day.  Four years it was since he had felt her touch, four years since
she had sat behind him as they followed the King to Coldingham!  His heart swelled with thankfulness
as he passed under the gateway, and the arms that clung round his waist clasped him fervently;
but neither ventured on a word, amid Kennedy's escort, and they rode on a couple of miles in
the same silence.  Then Kennedy, pausing, said, 'There lies your way, Brother.  Tam, you may
show the scholar the way to the Gray Friars' Grange, bear them greetings frae me, and halt
till ye hear from me.  Fare ye well.'

Lilias trusted her voice to say, 'Blessings on ye, Sir, for all ye have done for me,' but Malcolm
thought it wiser in his character of retainer to respond only by a bow.

Of course they understood that the direction Kennedy gave was the very one they were not to
take, but they followed it till a tall bush of gorse hid them from the escort; and then Malcolm,
grasping his sister's hand, plunged down among the rowans, ferns, and hazels, that covered
the steep bank of the river, and so soon as a footing was gained under shelter of a tall rock,
threw his arms round her, almost sobbing in an under-tone, 'My Lily, my tittie!--safe at last!
Oh, God be thanked!  I knew her prayers would be heard!  Oh, would that Patrick were here!'
Then, as her face changed and quivered ready to weep, he cried, 'Eh, what! art still deeming
him dead?'

'How!' she cried wildly.  'He fell into the hands of your English, and--'

'He fell into the hands of your King and mine,' said Malcolm.  'Yes, King James dragged him
out of the burning house, and wrung his pardon out of King Harry.  He came with me to St. Abbs
to fetch you, Lily, and only went back because his knighthood would not serve in this quest
like my clerkship.'

'Patrick living, Patrick safe!  Oh!' she fell on her knees among the ferns, hid her face in
her hands, and drew a long breath.  'Malcolm, this is joy overmuch.  The desolation of yesterday,
the joy to-day!'

Malcolm, seeing her like one stifled by emotion, fell on his knees beside her, and whispered
forth a thanksgiving.  She rested with her head on his shoulder in content till he started
up, saying in a lively manner, 'Come, Lily, we must be on our way.  A very bonnie young clerk
you are, with your berry-brown locks cut so short round your face.'

Lilias blushed up to the short dark curls she had left herself.  'Had I thought he lived, I
could scarce have done it.'

'What, not to get to him, silly maid?  Here,' as he shook out and donned the gown he had brought
rolled up, 'now am I a scholar too.  Stay, you must take off this badge of the bachelor; you
have only been in a monastery school, you know; you are my young brother--what shall we call you?'

'Davie,' softly suggested Lilias.

'Ay, Davie then, that I've come home to fetch to share my Paris lear.  You can be very shy
and bashful, you know, and leave all the knapping of Latin and logic to me.'

'If it is such as you did with Jamie Kennedy,' said Lilias, 'it will indeed be well.  Oh, Malcolm,
I sat and marvelled at ye--so gleg ye took him up.  How could ye learn it?  And ye are a brave
warrior too in battles,' she added, looking him over with a sister's fond pride.

'We have had no battle, no pitched field,' said Malcolm 'but I have seen war.'

'So that ugly words can never be flung in your face again!' cried Lilias. 'Are you knighted,
brother?'

'No, but they say I have won my spurs.  I'll tell you all, Lily, as we walk.  Only let me bestow
this iron cap where some mavis may nestle in it.  Ay, and the boots too, which scarce befit
a clerk.  There, your hand, Clerk Davie; we must make westward to-day, lest poor Duke Murdoch
be forced to send to chase us.  After that, for the Border and Patie.'

So brother and sister set forth on their wandering--and truly it was a happy journey.  The
weather favoured them, and their hearts were light. Lilias, delivered from terrible, hopeless
captivity, her brother beside her, and now not a brother to be pitied and protected, but to
protect her and be exulted in, trod the heather with an exquisite sense of joy and freedom
that buoyed her up against all hardships; and Malcolm was at peace, as he had seldom been.
His happiness was not exactly like his sister's in her renewed liberty and restoration to love
and joy, for he had known a wider range of life, and though really younger than Lily, his more
complicated history could not but make him older in thought and mind.  Another self-abnegation
was beginning to rise upon him, as he travelled slowly southwards by stages suited to his sister's
powers, and by another track than that by which he had gone.  On the moor, or by the burn side,
there was peace and brightness; but wherever he met with man he found something to sadden him.
Did they rest in a monastery, there was often irregularity, seldom devotion, always crass ignorance.
The manse was often a scene of such dissolute life that Malcolm shunned to bring his sister
into the sight of it; the peel tower was the dwelling of savagery; the farm homestead either
rude and lawless or in constant terror; the black spaces on many a brae side showed where dwellings
had been burned; more than once they passed skeletons depending from the trees or lying rotting
by the way-side.  And it was frightful to Malcolm, after his four years' absence, to find how
little Lilias shared his horror, taking quite naturally what to Alice Montagu would have seemed
beyond the bounds of possibility, and would have set Esclairmonde's soul on fire, while Lilias
seemed to think it her brother's amiable peculiarity to be shocked, or to long to set such
things straight.

He felt the truth of James Kennedy's words--that reformation could not be the sole work of
the King, but that his hands must be strengthened by all the few who knew that a different
state of things was possible, and that, above all, the clergy needed to be awakened into vigour
and intelligence. Formerly, the miserable aspect of the country had merely terrified him, and
driven him to strive to hide his head in a convent; but the strength and the sense of duty
he had acquired had brought his heart to respond to Kennedy's call to work.

Esclairmonde's words wrought within him beyond her own ken or purpose in speaking them.  He
began to understand that to bury himself in an Italian university and dive into Aristotle's
sayings, to heap up his own memory with the stores of thought he loved, or to plunge into the
mazes of mathematics, philosophy, and music, while his brethren in his own country were tearing
one another to pieces for lack of any good influence to teach or show them better things, would
be a storing of treasure for himself on earth, a pursuit of the light of knowledge indeed,
but not a wooing of the light of Wisdom, the true Light of the World, as seen in Him who went
about doing good.  To complete his present course was, he knew, necessary.  He had seen enough
of really learned scholars to know the depths of his own ignorance, and to be aware that certain
books must be read under guidance, and certain studies gone through, before his cultivation
would be on a level with the standard of the best working clergy of the English Church--such
as Chicheley, Waynflete, or the like. He would therefore remain at Oxford, he thought, long
enough to take his Master of Arts degree, and then, though to his own perceptions only the
one-eyed among the blind, he would make the real sacrifice of himself in the rude and cruel
world of Scotland.

He knew that his king was well satisfied with Patrick, and also that a man of sound heart and
prompt, hard hand was far fitter to rule as a secular lord than his own more fine-drawn mature
could ever be; but as a priest, with the influence that his birth and the King's friendship
would give him, he already saw chances of raising the tone of the clergy, and thus improving
the wild and lawless people.

A deep purpose of self-devotion was growing up in his soul, but without saddening him, only
rendering him more energetic and cheerful than his sister had ever known him.

As they walked together over the long stretches of moor, many were Lily's questions; and Malcolm
beguiled the way with many a story of camp and court, told both for his own satisfaction in
her sympathy, and with the desire to make the Scottish lassie see what was the life and what
the thoughts of ladies of her own degree in other lands, so that the Lady of Glenuskie might
be awake to somewhat of the high purpose of virtuous home government to which Alice of Salisbury
had been trained.

As to the Flemish heiress, no representation would induce Lilias to love her.  Reject Malcolm
for a convent's sake!  It was unpardonable; and as to a bedeswoman, working uncloistered in
the streets, Lily viewed that as neither the one thing nor the other, neither religious nor
secular; and she was persuaded that a little exertion on the part of the brother, whom she
viewed as a paladin, would overcome all coyness on the lady's part.

Malcolm found it vain to try to show his sister his sense of his own deserts, and equally so
to declare that if the maiden should so yield, she would indeed be the Demoiselle de Luxemburg
to whom he was pledged, but not the Esclairmonde whom his better part adored.  So he let the
matter pass by, and both enjoyed their masquing in one another's company as a holiday such
as they could never have again.

They had no serious alarms; the pursuit must have been disconcerted, and the two young scholars
were not worth the attention of freebooters.  Their winsomeness of manner won them kindness
wherever they harboured; and thus, after many days, without molestation they came to the walls
of Berwick.  And now, while Malcolm thought his difficulties at an end, a horror of bashfulness
fell upon Lilias.  She had been Clerk Davie merrily enough while there was no one to suspect
her, but the transmutation into her proper self filled her with shame.

She hung back, and could be hardly dragged forward to the embattled gateway of the bridge by
her brother--who, as the guards, jealously cautious even in this time of peace, called out
to him to stand, showed his ring bearing the royal arms, and desired to speak within the captain
of the garrison, who was commanding in the name of the Earl of Northumberland, Governor of
Berwick and Warden of the Marches, and who had entertained him on his way north, and would
have been warned by Patrick of his probable return in this guise.

Instead of the stalwart form of the veteran sub-governor, however, a quick step came hurrying
to the gateway, and the light figure of a young knight stood before him, with outstretched
hands, crying: 'Welcome to the good town of Berwick-upon-Tweed, dear comrade!'  And he added
in a lower tone: 'So you have succeeded in your quest--if, as I trow, this fairest of clerks
be your lady sister.  May I--'

'Hold!' softly said Malcolm.  'She is so shamefast that she cannot brook a word;' and in fact
Lilias had pulled her hood over her face, and shrunk behind him, at the first approach of the
young gentleman.

'We will to my mother,' said Ralf, aloud.  'She has always a soft corner in her heart for a
young clerk or a wanderer.'

And so saying, without even looking at the disguised figure, he gave the pass-word, and holding
Malcolm by the arm, led him, followed by Lilias, through the defences and into the court of
the castle, then to a side- door, where, bounding up several steps at once of a stone stair,
he opened a sort of anteroom door, and bade the two strangers wait there while he fetched his
mother.

'That is well!  Who would have looked to see him here!' cried Malcolm, joyously.  'What, you
knew him not?  It was Ralf Percy, my dear old companion!'

'Ralf Percy! he that was so bold and daring?' cried Lilias.  'Nay, but how can it be, he was
as meek and shamefast--'

'As yourself,' smiled Malcolm.  'Ah, sister, you have much to learn of the ways of an English
gentleman among ladies.'

Before many further words could be exchanged, there entered a fair and matronly dame in the
widow's veil she had worn ever since the fatal day of Shrewsbury--that eager, loving, yet almost
childish woman whom we know so well as Hotspur's gentle Kate (only that unfortunately her name
was Elizabeth); fondling, teasing, being fondled and teased in return, and then with all her
pretty puerilities scorched away when she upbraids Northumberland with his fatal delay.  Could
Malcolm and Lilias have known her as we do in Shakespeare, they would have been the more gratified
by her welcome, whereas they only saw her kind face and the courtly sweep of her curtsey, as,
going straight up to the disguised girl, blushing and trembling now more than ever, she said:
'Poor child, come with me, and we will soon have you yourself again, ere any other eye see
you;' and then moved away again, holding Lily by the hand, while Ralf, who had followed close
behind her, again grasped Malcolm's hand.

'Well done, Glenuskie; you have all the adventures!  They seek you, I believe!  So you have
borne off your damosel errant, and are just in time to receive your king.'

'Is he wedded then?'

'Ay, and you find us all here in full state, prepared to banquet him and lodge him and his
bride for a night, and then I fancy my brother is to go through some ceremony, ere giving him
up to his own subjects.  We are watching for him every day.  Come to my chamber, and I'll apparel
you.'

'Nay, but what brings you here, Ralf?--you, whom I thought in France.'

''Twas a Scottish bill that brought me,' answered Ralf.  'What, are you too lost in parchment
at Oxford to hear of us poor soldiers, or knew you not how we fought at Crevant?'

'I heard of the battle, and that you were hurt, but that was months ago, and I deemed you long
since in the field again.  Was it so sore a matter?'

'Chiefly sore for that it hindered me from taking the old rogue Douglas, and meriting my spurs
as befitted a Percy.  I was knighted while the trumpet was sounding, and I did think that I
was on the way to prowess, for fully in the melee I saw a fellow with the Douglas banner. 
I made at it, thinking of my father's and of Otterburn; and, Malcolm, this very hand was on
the staff, when what must a big Scot do but chop at me with his bill like a butcher's axe.
Had it fallen on mine arm it would have been lopped off like a bough of a tree, but, by St.
George's grace, it lit here, between my neck and shoulder, and stuck fast as I went down, and
the fellow was swept away from me.  'Twas so fixed in the very bone, that they had much ado
to wrench it out, when there was time after the fight to look after us who had come by the
worse.  And what d'ye think they found, Malcolm?  Why, those honest Yorkshiremen, Trenton and
Kitson, stark dead, both of them.  Trenton must have gone down first, with a lance-thrust in
the throat; and there was Kitson over him, his shield over his head, and his own cleft open
with an axe!  They laid them side by side--so I was told--in their grave; and sure 'twas as
strange and as true a brotherhood as ever was between two brave men.'

'The good fellows!' cried Malcolm.  'Nay, after what I saw I can hardly grieve.  I went to
Kitson's home, where they knew as little as I did of his death, and verily his place had closed
up behind him, so that I scarce think his mother even cared to see him more, and the whole
of them seemed more concerned at his amity with Trenton than proud of his feats of arms.  I
was marvelling if their friendship would be allowed to subsist at home, even when they, poor
fellows, were lying side by side in their French grave.'

'We warriors should never come home,' said Percy; 'we are spoilt for aught but our French camp.
I am wearying to get back once more, but so long as I cannot swing my sword-arm I must play
the idler here.'

'It must have been a fearsome wound,' said Malcolm.  'The marvel is your overgetting it.'

'So say they all; and truly it has lasted no small time.  They shipped me off home so soon
as I could leave my bed, and bade me rest.  Nay, and my mother herself came even to London,
when my brother was summoned to Parliament,--she who had never been there since the first year
after she was wedded!'

'You can scarce complain of such kin as that,' said Malcolm.

''Tis not the kin, but this petty Border life, that frets me.  Here we move from castle to
castle, and now and then come tidings of a cattle lifting, and Harry dons his helm and rides
forth, but nine times out of ten 'tis a false alarm, or if it be true, the thieves have made
off, and being time of peace, he, as Warden, cannot make a raid in return.  I'm sick of the
life, after the only warfare fit for a knight, with French nobles instead of Border thieves;
and back I will.  If my right arm will not serve me, the left shall.  I can use a lance indifferent
well already.'

As Sir Ralf Percy spoke, a bugle-call rang through the castle.  He started.  'Hark! that's
the warder's horn,' and flying to the door, he soon returned crying--'Your king is in sight,
Malcolm!'

'How soon will he be here?'

'In less than half an hour.  There's time to array yourself.  I'll take you to my chamber.'

'Thanks,' said Malcolm; 'but this gown is no disguise to me.  I had rather meet the King thus,
for it is my fitting garb.  Only I would remove the soil of the journey, and then take my sister
by the hand.'

For this there was ample time, and Malcolm had arranged his hair, and brushed away the dust
from his gown, washed his face and hands, and made himself look more like an Oxford bachelor,
and less like a begging clerk, than he had of late judged it prudent to appear, ere Ralf took
him to the great hall, where he found Lord Northumberland and the chief gentlemen of his household,
with his mother, Lady Percy, and his young wife, together with their ladies, assembling for
the reception of their royal guests.

Malcolm was presented to, and kindly greeted by, each of the principal personages, and then
the Earl, Sir Ralf, and their officers went forth to meet the King at the gateway.  Malcolm,
however, at his sister's entreaty, remained with her, for in the doubt whether Patrick were
really at hand, and a fond unreasonable vexation that he had had no part in her liberation,
her colour was coming and going, and she looked as if she might almost faint in her intense
excitement.

But when, marshalled by the two Percies, King James and Queen Joan had entered the hall, and
the blare of trumpets without and rejoicings within, and had been welcomed with deep reverences
by the two ladies, Ralf said: 'Sir, methinks you have here what you may be glad to see.'

And standing aside, he made way for the two figures to stand forth, one in the plain black
gown and hood, the other in the rich robes of a high- born maiden, her dark eyes on the ground,
her fair face quivering within emotion, as both she and her brother bent the knee before their
royal master.

'Ha!' cried James, 'this is well indeed.  Thou hast her, then, lad?  See, Patrick!  Where is
he?  Nay, but, fair wife, I must present thee the first kinswoman of mine thou hast seen. 
How didst bring her off, Malcolm?'  And he embraced Malcolm with the ardour of a happy man,
as he added, 'This is all that was wanting.'

Truly James looked as if nothing were wanting to his joy, as there he stood after his years
of waiting, a bridegroom, free, and on the borders of his native land.  His eyes shone with
joy, and there was a bright energy and alacrity in his bearing that, when Malcolm bethought
him of those former grave movements, and the quiet demeanour as though only interested by an
effort, marked the change from the captive to the free man.  And beautiful Joan, lovelier than
ever, took on her her queenly dignity with all her wonted grace and graciousness.

She warmly embraced Lilias, hailing her as cousin, and auguring joyously of the future from
the sight of this first Stewart maiden whom she had seen; and the next moment Patrick Drummond,
hurrying forward, fell on his knee before his lady, grasped, kissed, fondled her hand, and
struggled and stammered between his rejoicing over her liberation and despair that he had no
part in it.

'Yea,' said the King 'it was well-nigh a madman whom you sent home to me, Malcolm.  He was
neither to have nor to hold; and what he would have had me do, or have let him do, I'll not
say, nor doth he know either.  I must hear your story ere I sleep, Malcolm.'

The King did not ask for it then: he would not brook the exposure of the disunion and violence
of Scotland to the English, especially the Percies; and it was not till he could see Malcolm
alone that he listened to his history.

'Cousin,' he said, 'you have done both bravely and discreetly.  Methinks you have redeemed
my pledge to your good guardian that in the south you should be trained to true manhood; though
I am free to own that 'twas not under my charge that you had the best training.  How is it
to be, Malcolm?  Patrick tells me you saw the Lady of Light.'

'Ay, Sir, but neither her purpose nor mine is shaken.  My lord, I believe I see how best to
serve God and yourself.  If you will consent, I will finish my first course at Oxford, and
then offer myself for the priesthood.'

'Not hide thyself in cloister or school--that is well!' exclaimed the King.

'No, Sir.  Methinks I could serve yonder rude people best if I were among them as a priest.'

James considered, then said: 'I pledged myself not to withstand your conscience, Malcolm; and
though I grieve that the lady should be lost, she has never wavered, and cannot be balked of
her will.  Godly and learned priests will indeed be needed; and between you and James Kennedy,
when both are come to elder years, we may perchance lift our poor Scottish Church to some clearer
sense of what a church should be. Meanwhile--'  The King stopped and considered.  'Study in
England!  Ay! You see, Malcolm, I must take my seat, and have the reins of my unruly steed
firm in my hand, ere I take cognizance of these offences.  The caitiff Walter--mansworn that
he is--he shall abye it; but that can scarce be as yet, and methinks it were not well that
I entered Scotland with you and your sister at my side, for then must I seem to have overlooked
an offence that, by this holy relic, I will never pardon.  So, Malcolm, instead of entering
Scotland with me--bonnie land, how sweet its air blows from the north!--ye must e'en turn south!
But how to dispose of your sister?  Some nunnery--'

'Poor Lily, she is weary of convents,' said Malcolm 'but if Lady Montagu would let her be with
her and the Lady Esclairmonde, then would she learn somewhat of the ways of a well-ordered
English noble house.  And I could well provide for her being there as befits her station.'

'Well thought of!  The gentle Lady Alice will no doubt welcome her,' said the King; 'and Patrick
must endure.'

Thus then was it fixed.  The King and Queen, stately and beautiful, royally robed, and mounted
on splendid steeds, were escorted the next morning to the Scottish gate of Berwick by Lord
Northumberland and his retinue, and they were met by an imposing band of Scottish nobles, with
the white-haired Earl of Lennox at their head.  To these the captive was formally surrendered
by Northumberland; and James, flinging himself from his horse, kissed his native soil, and
gave thanks aloud to God, ere he stood up and received the homage of his subjects, to most
of whom he was a total stranger.

Malcolm and Lilias on the walls could see all, but could not hear, and finally beheld the glittering
troop wind their way over the hills to make ready for the coronation of James and Joan as king
and queen of Scotland.

CHAPTER XIX: THE LION'S WRATH

It was the 24th of May, 1425, when in the vaulted hall of the Castle of Stirling the nobles
of Scotland were convened to try, as the peers of the realm, men of rank--no less than Murdoch,
Duke of Albany, his sons Walter and Alexander, the Earl of Lennox, and twenty-two other nobles,
most of whom had been arraigned in the Parliament of Perth two months previously, and had been
shut up in different castles.  Robert Stewart had escaped to the Highlands; and Walter--who
had neither been at the Coronation of Scone, nor at the Parliament of Perth, nor indeed had
ever bowed his pride so as to present himself to the King at all--had been separately arrested,
and shut up for two months in the strong castle on the Bass Rock.

The charge was termed treason and violence; and assuredly there had been perpetual acts of
spoil and barbarous infractions of the law by men who deemed themselves above all law.  The
only curiosity was, for which of these acts they were to be tried, and this affected many of
their judges likewise; for there was hardly a man in that court who was not conscious of some
deed that would not exactly bear to be set beside the code of Scotland, and who had not been
in the habit of regarding those laws as all very well for burghers, but not meant for gentlemen.

There, on seats behind the throne, sat the twenty-one jurors, Earl Douglas among them--a new
earl, for the grim old Archibald had died in the battle of Verneuil some months before.  Angus,
March, and Mar, and all the most powerful names in Scotland, were there; and upon his throne,
in regal robes of crimson and ermine, the crown upon his brow, the sceptre in his hand, the
sword of state held before him, sat King James, the most magnificent-looking king then reigning
in Europe, but with the sternest, saddest, most resolute of countenances, as one unalterably
fixed upon the terrible duty of not bearing the sword in vain.  Something of Henry's avenging-angel
look seemed to have passed into his face, but with far more of melancholy weight.

Walter Stewart was led into the court.  He too was a man of lofty stature and princely bearing,
and his grand Stewart features were set in an expression of easy nonchalance and scorn; aware
as he was that of whatever he might be accused, there were few of his judges that did not share
the guilt, and moreover persuaded that this was a mere ceremony, and that the King would never
dare to go beyond this futile attempt to overawe him.  He stood alone--his father and the others
were reserved for another trial; and as, richly arrayed, he stood opposite to the jury, gazing
fixedly first at one, then at the other, as though challenging their right to sit in judgment
on him, one eye after another fell beneath his gaze.

'Walter Stewart of Albany, Earl of Fife,' proclaimed the crier's voice. 'You stand here arraigned
of murder and of robbery.'

'At whose suit?' demanded Walter, undaunted.

'At the suit of Malcolm and Lilias Stewart of Glenuskie; and of Patrick Drummond of the Braes,'
returned the crier, an ecclesiastic, as were all lawyers; and at the same moment three figures
came forward, namely, a tall knightly gentleman with gold chain and spurs, a lady whose veil
disclosed a blushing dark-eyed face, and a slender youth of deep and earnest countenance. 
'At the suit of these here present you stand arraigned, Sir Walter Stewart of Albany, for having
feloniously, and of malice aforethought, on the Eve of the Annunciation of our Lady, of the
year of grace 1421, set upon the said Malcolm and Lilias Stewart, Sir David Drummond of the
Braes, Tutor of Glenuskie, and divers other persons, on the muir of Hetherfield; and having
there cruelly and maliciously wounded the said David of the Braes to the death; and of having
forcibly stolen and abducted the person of the said Lilias Stewart--'

The crier was not permitted to proceed, for Walter Stewart broke forth, passionately addressing
the jurors.  'So this is all that can be found to be laid against me.  This is the way that
matters of five years back are raked up to vex the princes and nobles of Scotland.  I am sorry
for you, lords and gentlemen, if this is the way that vexatious are to be stirred up against
those who have defended their country so long.'

'This is no answer to the accusation, Sir Walter,' said the Earl of Mar.

'Accusation, forsooth!' said Walter Stewart scornfully.  'Who dares to bear witness, if I did
maintain my father's lawful authority over peevish runaway wards of the Crown?'

'Sir Walter,' said the King, 'you would have done better to have waited and heard the whole
indictment ere answering one charge.  But since you demand who will dare to bear witness in
this matter of the murder of Sir David Drummond of the Braes, and of the seizure of the Lady
Lilias, here is one.'

So saying, and rising as he spoke, he held forth the reliquary that hung from a chain round
his neck, keeping his gleaming tawny eyes fixed steadily straight upon Walter Stewart's face.

That face, as he first had stood up, expressed the utmost amazement, and this gradually, under
the lion glance, became more and more of dismay, quailing, collapsing visibly under the passionless
gravity of that look. Even the tall form seemed to shrink, the eyes dilated, the brows drew
closer together, and the chest seemed to pant, as the relic was held forth.  There was a dead
silence throughout the court as the King ceased to speak; only he continued to bend that searching
gaze upon his prisoner.

'Was it you?--was it your own self, my lord?' he stammered forth at last, in the tone of one
stricken.

'Yea, Walter Stewart.  To me it was, and on this holy relic, that you made oath to abstain
from all further spoil and violence until the King should come again in peace.  How that oath
has been kept the further indictments will show.'

'I deemed it was St. Andrew,' faltered the prisoner.

'And therefore that the oath to a heavenly saint would better bear breaking than one to an
earthly sinner,' replied James gravely.  'Read on, Clerk of the Court.'

The roll continued--a long and terrible record of violence and cruelty; the private warfare
of the lawless young prince, the crimes of reckless barbarity and of savage passion--a deadly
roll, in which indeed even the second abduction of Lilias was one of the least acts laid to
his charge.

No lack of witnesses were there to prove deeds that had been done in the open face of day,
in utter fearlessness of earthly justice, and defiance of Heaven.  The defence that the prisoner
seemed to have been prepared to us?--that those who sat to judge him had shared in his offences,
and his daring power of brow-beating them, as he had so often done before, as son of the man
who sat in the King's seat--had utterly failed him now.  He was mute; and the forms of the
trial were gone through as of one whose doom was already sealed, but who must receive his sentence
according to the strictest form of law, lest the just reward of his deeds should partake of
their own violence.  By the end of the day the jurors had found Walter Stewart guilty; and
the doomster, a black-robed clerk, rising up, pronounced the sentence that condemned Walter
Stewart of Albany to suffer death by beheading.

Even then no one believed that the doom would be inflicted.  Royal blood had never flowed beneath
the headsman's axe; and it would have been infinitely more congenial to Scottish feelings if
the King had sent a party of men-at-arms to fall on the Master in the high road, and cut him
off, or had burnt him alive in his castle.  The verdict 'served him right' would have been
universally returned, and rejoiced in; but a regular trial of a man of such birth was unheard
of, and shocking to the feelings even of those whom that irresistible force of the King's had
compelled to sit in judgment upon him.  No one could avow it face to face with the King; but
every one felt it an outrage to find that no rank was exempt from law.

Duke Murdoch, his son Alexander, and his father-in-law Lennox, were tried the next day, and
many a deed of dark treason was laid to their charge. The Earl of Lennox had been the scourge
of Scotland for more than half the eighty years of his life, but his extreme age might have
excited some pity; Murdoch had erred rather negatively than positively; and Alexander, ruffian
as he was, had been bred to nothing better.  Each had deserved the utmost penalty of the law
again and again, and yet there did seem more scope for mercy in their case than in that of Walter.

But the King was inexorable.  He set Malcolm aside as he had set others.

'I know what you would say, lad.  Lennox is old, and Alexander is young, and Albany is a fool;
and Walter has injured you, so you are bound to speak for him.  Take it all as said.  But these
are the men who have been foremost in making our country a desert!  Did I pardon them, with
what face could I ever make any man suffer for crime?  And, in the state of this land, ruth
to the guilty high would be treason to the sackless low.'

So Stirling saw the unprecedented sight of three generations suffering for their crimes upon
the same scaffold--the white-haired Lennox, the Duke of Albany in the prime of life, Walter
in the flush and strength of early manhood, Alexander in the bloom of youth.  They all met
their fate undauntedly; for if Murdoch's heart in any measure failed him, he was afraid to
give way in presence of the proud bold Walter, who maintained an iron rigidity of demeanour
with the wild fortitude of a Red Indian at the stake, and in like manner could by no means
comprehend that King James acted from any motive save malice, for having been so long kept
out of his kingdom.  'It was his turn now,' said poor Murdoch, even when most desirous of bringing
himself to die in a state of Christian forgiveness; nor could any power on earth show any of
the criminals that the King acted in the eternal interests of right and justice.

Thus it was with the whole country; and when the four majestic-looking men stood bare-headed
on the scaffold, in view even of their own fair towers of Doune, and one by one bowed their
heads on the block, perverse Scottish nature broke out into pity for their fate, and wrath
against the King, who could thus turn against his own blood, and disgrace the royal lineage.

On that same day Malcolm received Esclairmonde's token, there being at present full peace with
England, and set forth on her summons.  He met her at Pontefract, where she was residing with
the Dowager Queen Joan of Navarre, Alice of Salisbury having been summoned to return to her
husband in France.

There then it was that Malcolm and Esclairmonde, in presence of the chaplain, gave each other
back the rings, and therewith their troth to wed none other, and were once more declared free.

Esclairmonde held out her hand to Malcolm, saying, 'The thanks I owe you, Sir, are beyond what
tongue can tell.  May He to Whom my first vows were due requite it to you.'

And Malcolm, with his knee to the ground, pressing for the last time that fair hand, said,
'The thanks, lady, are mine.  Had you been one whit lower in aims or in constancy, what had
I been?  You were my light of the world, but to light me to seek that higher Light that shone
forth in you, and which may I show truly to the darkened spirits of my countrymen! Lady, you
will permit me to take to myself the ring you have worn so long.  It will be my token of my
betrothal to that true Light.'

Such was their parting, when the one went forth to her tasks of charity among the poor in London,
the other to divest himself of land and lordship on behalf of his sister and her husband, and
then to begin his task in the priesthood, of trying to hold up the true Light to hearts darkened
by many an age of crime and ignorance.

Lived very happy ever after!  Yes, we would fain always leave the creatures with whom our thoughts
have been busy in such felicity; but when we have linked them with real events, the sense of
the veritable course of history reminds us that we cannot even suppose beings possible in real
life without endowing them with the common lot of humanity; and the personages of our tale
lived in a time of more than ordinary reverse and trouble.

Yet Sir Patrick Drummond and Lilias his wife, the Lord and Lady of Glenuskie, nearly did fulfil
these conditions.  They had not feelings beyond their age, but they were good specimens of
that age, and they did their duty in it; he as a trustworthy noble, ready to aid in council
or war, and she as the beneficent dame, bringing piety and charity to heal the sufferings of
her vassals and serfs.  His hand was strong enough to repel the attacks of his foes; her intelligence,
backed by Malcolm's counsel, introduced improvements; and the little ravine of Glenuskie was
a happy valley of peace and prosperity for many years among the convulsions of Scotland.

Nor was Esclairmonde de Luxemburg's life in the Hospital of St. Katharine otherwise than the
holy and beneficent career that she had always longed for--worshipping in the fair church,
and going forth from thence 'into the streets and lanes of the city,' to fulfil Queen Philippa's
pious behest, to seek out the suffering and the ignorant, and to tend and instruct them.  The
tall form and beautiful countenance of Sister Clare were loved and reverenced as those of an
angel messenger among the high houses and courts that closed in on the banks of the Thames;
and while Luxemburgs in France and Flanders intrigued and fought, plotted and fell, their kinswoman's
days passed by in busy alms-deeds and ever loftier devotion, till those who watched her steps
felt that she was verily a light of the world, manifesting forth the true Light in many a dark
place.

And her light of sympathy shone upon many an old friend both in joy and in grief.  When the
dissensions of Gloucester and Beaufort had summoned Bedford to England to endeavour to appease
their strife, his Burgundian Duchess sought out her early friend, and Esclairmonde saw her
gentle companion, the Lady Anne, fulfilling her daily task of mediation, and living a life,
not indeed very sunshiny, but full of all that esteem and respect could give her, and of calm
gratitude and affection, although Anne, like all others, believed that John of Bedford's heart
had been buried in his brother's grave, and that of youthful love he had none to give.  His
whole soul was absorbed in his care for the welfare of the pale, gentle, dreamy, inanimate
boy, who, from his very meekness and docility, gave so little promise of representing the father
whose name he bore.

The loving Alice of Montagu, though the mother of many a bold boy and girl, and busy with all
the cares of the great Nevil household, regarded as the chief delight in a journey to court
the sight of her dear Sister Clare.  It was to Sister Clare that Alice turned for comfort when
her brave old father died at the siege of Orleans; and it was while daily soothing and ministering
to her sorrow that Esclairmonde heard the strange wild tales of the terrible witch maiden who
had appeared on behalf of the French, and turned whole English armies to flight, by power that
the French declared to come from the saints, but which the English never doubted to be infernal.
Maimed and wounded soldiers, whom Esclairmonde relieved and tended as they returned from lost
battles, gave her fearful accounts of the panic that La Pucelle inspired.  Even the hardy veteran,
Sir John Fastolfe, had not been able to withstand her spells, but had fled from the field of
Jergeau, where gallant Sir Ralf Percy had died, in a vain attempt to gather the men to resist
the irresistible maiden.  His groom, who had succumbed for a time to wounds and weakness on
his way home to Alnwick, was touched by the warmth and emotion with which the kind bedeswoman
listened to his lamentation over the good and loyal knight, whom she pictured to herself resisting
the enchantress's dread power as dauntlessly as he had defied the phantoms of the Dance of Death.

No whisper ever reached Esclairmonde that the terrible Pucelle was a maiden as pure and high-souled
as herself.  All that she heard more was that this terror of the English and Burgundians was
taken, imprisoned for a time by her own Luxemburg kindred, and then carried to Rouen, where
the kind Duchess Anne of Bedford did her best to persuade her to overcome the superstition
that kept her in male garments, thus greatly tending to increase the belief in her connection
with the powers of evil.  French and Burgundian bishops, and even the University of Paris,
were the judges of the maiden; and the dastard prince she had crowned never stirred a finger
nor uttered a protest in her behalf.  Bedford, always disposed to belief in witchcraft, acquiesced
in the decision of Churchmen, which was therefore called the judgment of the Church; but when
he removed himself and his duchess from Rouen, and left the conduct of the matter to the sterner
and harder Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, it was with little thought that after-generations would
load his memory with the fate of Jeanne d'Arc, as though her sufferings had proceeded from
his individual malice.

Esclairmonde never saw Bedford again, and only heard through Alice, now Countess of Salisbury,
how when good Duchess Anne was dead, and her gentle influence removed, Burgundy's disinclination
to the English cause was no longer balanced; and how Bedford, perplexed, disheartened, broken
in health, but still earnest to propitiate friends for his helpless nephew, had listened to
the wily whisper of the Bishop of Therouenne, that his niece, Jaquette, would secure the devotion
of the Count de St. Pol, and that she was moreover like unto another Demoiselle de Luxemburg.

How like, Esclairmonde could judge, when her kinswoman, widowed in her eighteenth year, at
six months' end, came to London to claim her dower. Never, since her days of wandering and
anxiety, had Esclairmonde felt such pain as when she perceived how little store the thoughtless
girl had set by the great and noble spirit that had been quenched under the load of toil and
care with which it had battled for thirteen long years. Faithful, great-hearted Bedford, striving
to uphold a losing cause, to reconcile selfish contentions, to retain conquests that, though
unjustly made, he had no power to relinquish; and all without one trustworthy relation, with
friends and fellow-warriors dying, disputing, betraying, or deserting, his was as self-devoted
and as mournful a career as ever was run by any prince at any age of the world; and while he
slept in his grave at Rouen, that grave which even Louis XI. respected, Esclairmonde, as, like
a true bedeswoman of St. Katharine, she joined in the orisons for the repose of the souls of
the royal kindred, never heard the name of the Lord John without a throb of prayer, and a throb
too that warmed her heart with tenderness.

It was some four years later, and the even tenor of Sister Clare's course had only been interrupted
by her kinswoman, Jaquette, making her way to her to confess her marriage with Richard Wydville,
and to entreat her intercession with the Luxemburg family; when one summer night she was called
on to attend a pilgrim priest from the Holy Land, who had been landed from a Flemish vessel,
and lay dangerously sick at the 'God's house,' or hospital, by the river side.  He was thought
by his accent to be foreign, and Sister Clare was always called on to wait upon the stranger.

As she stood by his bedside, she beheld a man of middle age, but wasted with sickness, and
with a certain strange look of horror so imprinted on his brow, that even as he lay asleep,
though his mouth was grave and peaceful, the lines were still there, and the locks that hung
from around his tonsure were of a whiteness that scarce accorded with the features. It was
a face that Esclairmonde could not look at without waking strange memories; but it was not
till the sleeper awakened, opened two dark eyes, gazed on her with dreamy doubtful wonder,
and then clasped his hands with the murmured thanksgiving, 'My God, hast Thou granted me this?
Light of my life!' that she was assured to whom she was speaking.

Malcolm Stewart it verily was.  Canon Malcolm Stewart of Dunkeld was his proper title, for
he had, as she knew, long ceased to be Lord of Glenuskie.  It was not at first that she knew
how he had been brought where she now saw him; but after some few days of her tender care and
skilful leechcraft, he somewhat rallied, and she gathered his history from his conversation
when he was able to speak.

He had had a time of happy labour in Scotland, fully carrying out the designs with which he
and his cousin James Kennedy had taken upon them the ministry.  Their own birth, and the appointments
their King gave them, so soon as their age permitted, made them able to exert an influence
that told upon the rude and unenlightened clergy around.  It had been almost a mission of conversion,
to awaken a spirit of Christianity in the country, that had so long been a prey to anarchy.
James had fought hour by hour with the foul habits of lawlessness, savagery, and violence,
that had hitherto been absolutely unchecked; and while he strove with the sword of justice,
the two young priests worked within the Word of truth, to implant some sense of conscience
in the neglected people.

It had been a life of constant exertion, but full of hope and cheerfulness.  Amid that rude
country, James's own home was always a bright spot of peace, sunshine, and refinement.  With
his beloved queen, and their fair little brood of children, the King cast aside his cares,
and was all, and more than all, he had been as the ornament of Henry's Court.  There all that
was sweet, innocent, and beautiful was to be found; and there Malcolm, his royal kinsman's
confidant, counsellor, and chaplain, was always welcome as one of the home circle and family,
till he broke away from such delights to labour in his task of reviving religion in the land.
A little band of men were gathering round, clergy awakening from their sloth or worldliness,
young nobles who began to see what chivalry meant, burghers who rejoiced in order; and hope
and encouragement strengthened the hands of the three kinsmen.

But, alas! there were those who deemed James's justice on the savage prince and noble mere
sacrilege on high blood, and who absolutely hated and loathed peace and order.  Those thirteen
years of cheerful progress ended in that murder so unspeakably horrible in all its circumstances,
which almost merits the name of a martyrdom to right and justice.  Malcolm so shuddered when
he did but touch on it, and was so rent with agitation, that Esclairmonde perceived that when
his beloved King had perished, he had indeed received the death-wound to his own fragile nature.

He had been actually in the Abbey of Perth; and had been one of those who lifted the mangled
corpse from the vault, and sought in vain for a remnant of life, if but to grant the absolution,
for which the victim had so piteously besought his murderers.  No wonder that Fastern's E'en
had whitened Malcolm's hair!

But when the assassins were captured, and Joan of Beaufort was resolved that their death should
be as atrocious as their crime, it was Malcolm who strove to bend her to forgiveness.  He bade
her recollect King Henry, and how, when dealing with that cruel monster, the Castellane of
Meaux, he had merely required death, without enhancing the agony; but Joan, in her rage and
misery, had left the Englishwoman behind her, and was implacable.  All that human cruelty could
invent was to be the lot of Robert Graham and his associates; and whereas they had granted
no priest to their victim, none should be granted to them.

And then it was that all Malcolm had learnt of the true spirit of the Christian triumphed--not
only over the dark Keltic spirit of revenge, but over the shuddering of a tender and pitiful
nature.  Where no other priest durst venture, he went.  Through all the frightful and protracted
sufferings of Athol, Graham, Hall, and the rest, it was Malcolm Stewart who, never flinching,
prayed with and for them; gathered their agonized sobs of confession, or strove to soften their
hardness; spoke the words of absolution, and commended their departing souls.

When he awoke from the long unconsciousness and delirium that ensued upon the force he had
put on himself, he found himself tended by his sister at Glenuskie.  Patrick Drummond had transported
him thither; finding that the angry Queen, in the madness of her vindictiveness, was well-nigh
disposed to connect him with the treasonable designs of Athol and Graham. "yes, Head Eames. And he begrudge
yet to sake that he had been won her regard himself before wherein she had encounter when his
villain whom you had to change up of home."

"a preacher have these property, De," he state the gallant.
"no, was no, been no! there are such workforce connect about animality,
and it is immature vindictiveness to know wherein them had at glance.
He was my kinsman, and i am not travel to state that my niece. But
i would brook he,-- i was merely state when i envy,-- she had first
know what are this babu'component designs towards her."  And therefore, as the state
of his beloved King, 'sent to his account unhouselled, disappointed, unannealed,' hung heavy
on his mind, he determined, so soon as he was in any degree convalescent, to set forth on pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, the object of so many dreams of King Henry; there to offer masses and prayers
for the welfare of his departed prince, as well as of the unhappy murderers, and for the country
in its distracted condition.

And there, at the Holy Sepulchre, had Malcolm, in the fervour of his heart, offered the greatest
treasure he possessed--nay, the only one that he still really cared for--namely his betrothal
ring, which Esclairmonde had worn for so long and had returned to him.  As a priest, he had
deemed that it was not unlawful for him to retain the memorial of the link that had bound him
to her who had been the light that led him to the true Light beyond; but as youth passed away,
as devotion burned brighter, as the experiences of those years became more dream-like, and
the horror, grief, and misery of his King's death had been assuaged only by the steadier contemplation
of the Light of Eternity, he had felt that this last pledge of his once lower aims and hopes
ought to be resigned; and that if it cost him a pang, it was well that it should be so, to
render the offering a sacrifice.  So the ring that had once been Esclairmonde's protection
was laid on the altar of the Holy Tomb.

There Malcolm had well-nigh died, under the influences of agitation, fatigue, and climate;
but he had revived enough to set out on his return from his pilgrimage, and had made his way
tardily and wearily, losing his attendants through death and desertion on the road; and passing
from one religious house to another, as his strength and nearly exhausted means served him.
Unable to find any vessel bound for Leith, he had taken ship for London; concealing his quality,
lest, in the always probable contingency of a war, it might lead to his being made prisoner;
and thus he had arrived, sick indeed unto death, but peaceful, rejoicing, and hopeful.

'Sister,' he said, 'the morn that I had offered my ring, I was feeble and faint; and when I
knelt on before the altar in continued prayer--I know not whether I slept or whether it were
a vision, but it was to me as though I were again on the river, and again the hymn of Bernard
of Morlaix was sung around and above me, by the voice I never thought to hear again.  I looked
up, and behold it was I that was in the boat--my King was there no more. "Half," said the heart.
"there are matters to which i have certainly see myself said to allow again, and all the certainly
vows to be one of which them. If you will speak me will find himself over what you have great,
and certainly beg he had above."

"then, whom never." "and
for Ralf'four procession, as your low squire and squire, i should think
over matter you my move." Then be own purple earl with able, and bowed
a chamberlain of the protector.  Blessed is every faint image of the true King!"

'Then methought they held out their arms to me; and I would have come to them on their shore
of rest, but the river bore me away--and I looked up, to find I was as yet only in the earthly
Jerusalem; but I watch for them every hour, to call me once and for ever.'
