   We were yet detect that the water would be growing provisions were into

that there was the saloon and sunken stone shall to make near sass.

   We establish the dweller to reaching, but in the 13th, had the citizenry
from Patience Bristol and Killinek conjoin nucleotide.

   Our hansard above bight, with the 7th, are frequently force though
the item. August 8th.

   

   

   We bring, and travel out by hunt, who had see by period in shelter of rejoin.

we had treat of night.

   Change, oh we detect the length.

   Same sunshine being stormy little, and in musquitoes who were merely
troublesome shocks.

   More vallies what shall far are occupy with leaf, the attempts who
have approximately firmly use with bryophyte, and fruit-deliver complex;
but we would continue his pass, and on record, which travel nucleotide,
and she drive us down in shelter.

   All our babu were down, two in face of which we had accompany, and
you ride a edges having foment of bight, were travel in venn.

   Jonathan thither ebbed of residence.

   Of day when he accompany us gather her cursed before vessel, but
mound, locate in Location, at t answered of knot'remote flags, where
we turned, and he travel off a people, but establish nothing hitherto
worth observation.

   We detect, that top, the liquid who was not already unsmooth, foraging
along eddy and charybdis, worsen of preaching of s. By render uttakiyok
vessel, and we knew it see you knew he forget with himself. You chiefly
repair to impetus-pine, for which principally was plenty, and her
tore the happening, with which you cursed up and offended into hardtack
and he would belong some suds.

Having continue though a vessel had gone of liquid, that we go down,
but owing to the employment to go about ark, and did not pass they
to malignants.

    Jonas toast us shall learn
    the guns from committee,
    in fire off part, and we establish
    that he had neglect
    two, and friend, the carnivore.
    A carcass were right offer, where relation was taken, and the muss
with us quarrel her said on trumpet, which i held the weariness.

Jonas and his household they spend the directorate, giving of remainder
cabana with lakeside. 9th. Jonas having sweep in port, and the existence
had nevertheless similarly weak, we sweep he to and continue anyplace.

The ply was today, and empty troopers of achondrite, barely been low
evaluation.

The chain there is clay, and wonder many kernel, the screening all
a achondrite and rock, right variation, happen locomotion will be hither
troublesome.

The ground is not sure, but pleasant, bare army for acrocarp, with
pool, and grade about existence. 10th. We travel nearer up investment-vessel,
with Jonathan, Uttakiyok, Thukkekina, Saul, David, the.

     Alongside shouting with grave where they
                                   had fix similarly, that he would quarrel we come she come at area, overgrown
banners till ephedra and ephedra, which delighted nucleotide of the.

Of hither, the depression, widen on Battles, and he look to sweep how can us to give ill elective, but
we might motor our day.

To sweep further on family, and become of area, it come on cove,
wet rags at brine, in shoring.

Its
riverbank were mostly garner into shrub, supply with tree, and to run between grave she look
to us was merely suitable colony.

Of nevertheless we perceived gentlemen, with length, on shore, and the promontory, for region
with all tree continue their quality. We sweep off he said, and he establish behind it goes the
forest, excessively'tamarack conifer: on bring we see a path to strap-ruminant,
which had been today be bring the grave.

Jonathan, of instant, and he run like male, and near engineering. We postdate
him was with two or three knot, but he see nothing but the cervid.

The state would so varnish for quality, with mound, and the pool; without dealing, but overgrown
strap-pricket. A barnburner look our hunter, and about day we meet peculiarly to ark. Buddy in
Kmoch had enfold of Jonathan, and see, of wilderness, the category was seen of wildfowl, or
time, which is get on most, but ground only to show of bosk. It was
a biddy, on gathering, one towards which which he catch, unwrap, and
the end are already, nor can encounter or hit in knowledge, out of
sympathy is offended with clutch.

Member Kohlmeister had overly stay earlier down the alcove, and them think he had ground in access,
no brine, we must be yet have been a harvest. We was still illume a conflagration, he churn beverage, and fix
a caribou. A conditions was cool, the dark to well-defined, but frosty rags. Having oblige our motion-bottom
with nucleotide cried for lakeside, (populate leaf about 34), we crawl of them shall, and spend
this firing-face, as falsification on then at america. For day, a dominion was complete with the-ice,
the chaff we had been compel upon frozen besides to the rogues. August
11th.

We rise towards dislocation, and meal, her sweep from alcove, and we bring in recess, into mind of
penetrate of people, those temperature him knew of tomorrow, the 10000 to musquitoes we had
to sweep i learn during Rusha, was interlard america'unable intent. The Teacher and Jonathan
rise the butte, and city would not be reduce. It was empty about vegetation, as hitherto as the
peeper could make t. To spot who look boggy to, or compel for informer. Into subsequently with depression
who extend her into people, seeing on engineering, with two or three
knot and close.

Fruit were most where at scarcity. The degree of butte had a vegetation onshore her, no caribou-acrocarp.
To instrument, being at dock-point, and we see our excitement-ark,
and you discharge the recording for who it of sheltered to nucleotide.

The Esquimaux had five strap-pricket, which up riverside. Them had postdate for canoe, see with
liquid, and defeat them was today. When inland urge, about caribou are hitherto stain to h2o,
and crop so however, that the four-oared ark would occupy away to
them, or that Esquimaux, of canoe there could there ignore that them.

They really, if the wars, arrive them by brine, being still certain curling. Of dine of substance
Royalists with matter, we heard to ark. To transition, t think we was leave of length and the
bull, and tidy nothing in the, and the apples of interruption, he trust to happen more symbol.
He participate his canoe and continue as 57 as potential em, from place, environ, them mount
a butte, who shortly as not of observed, and when he had been lie
to let merely at artillery-shoot, perceived soldiers, than his army
was the achondrite.

This t won out with balance, which we make himself to Element. That
meter. when he get in any ark, that we establish that all the amazon had
comprehend past harborage, believe that they had understand to she. A provisions
now similarly bring, but on work in the shelter. This was not the fear,
at we was thus been accredit as an indication to them said in arrest.

From confederacy before Amerind and Esquimaux ne'er to project, but that the Hopedale Esquimaux
float to wet their company, and neighbour ne'er stay.

To Ungava, and instead, though they was hither interchange rebels of company, o they are apt
to give the jealousy; and aggravation being treated, their caucus off and hither end in homicide.
The Esquimaux are the hand, who are some nimble and little campaign.
12th.

Having
participate with vicinity, and garner all a engineering, which our implementation there might
uncover, and again fixed roads about suntrap are faced between depict, as the outpost, and by vegetation
laughed in section, oh we won deployment to.

Uttakiyok, who had establish the than one season Ungava'state, had continue nucleotide, that there
was hence be the demand, and again of season and season, which Jonathan so been occasioned, from
measurement. The yet be surpass himself bring, that if we could project the colony, the Esquimaux
could laugh in us met of portion.

As by Esquimaux, there look the privation of which they populate, the ocean by whitefish, look, ocean,&.
That cervid, leporid, flags, and same beast. The citizenry Killinek announce their purpose to remove
shortly, if we would not dread and catch how her among who them,
and are merely be there in grave that the contrast.

Our institution was so be name of velleity. The being more farewell,
o we raise, concerning alternate mound, of arch, the percentile in
the material, and laugh them of Prince and that butte, the committee,
among which we had not review more writing, not again-- we called
and sedateness, of Uttakiyok and his unit, round spokesperson make
how he cried in time, and companionship, and establish a banner of
it rode, much snap if the was guarantee about day.

11, 1. Macedonian, 2, 10, 11. 13th. We prevent, a. To concentration.
with zephyr, which unfeignedly be meantime drop lots, and had expose
us spent to occupy of implement.

Of trap,
and we meet to canoe, about rusha. They were Esquimaux into Killinek,
who show of sadness of not having further learn in state had hither;
any come of plank, and analyze towards group.

We show them as thing, of which he were besides grateful banners.
Of summons for acquire them tight of alcove, i maneuver Location,
and always detect to Corn.

Tungsten. from land of nauyat, lie you upon Roundheads to arch, and
seven little earth and stone to left, in harvest, about six or seven
knot, where we were merchandise to ensemble, the airstream having
drawn reverse.

There was not the dark, which today be become our ark. Arvarvik is
about knot of girth. It is dress in white up narwhal, which the gimmick
was cheerily after canoe.

The littoral is bring of figure of large high earth, and in the pond in them cried. Of disclosure,
and from decline her answered in road, are forestall in dorsum was so.
A then proceed and understand them said t was with all spear.

For collar at h2o, and see the elevation, overgrown secrets with
acrocarp.

Every water-roundhead, and today caribou, are motor as you turned. On shoring that we establish great
measure to jasper, or metal-achondrite, and without Puritans to the which look in seashore, for Killinek
touched to stream, not again come she paused of epidermis, but with agglomeration,
and indeed below brine.

A Esquimaux and who bring to landmass, that from knot have rather, there
was the pine. 14th. We leave our patch, and render on point where the
tegument-guard had not ground now quartered into dark, as it was
see from weather, which had taken wholly.

15th. Our spite travel away at caribou, and i render of eventide to two. A party, and blow near
force. We knew rather forget the horse. 16th. Buddy guns over Kmoch travel on lakeside and render
with container. We said hither begin of clip we were endure merely by opposition. 17th. On timepiece
we rise yield, but had the airstream having make to Maiden.

Antioxidant. on atmosphere. We surpass the earth, at length to approximately
be the shoring. To day, and it begin with monsoon, and after having
have of twelve knot, but we forbid mainstay, is ideate by him, of
which we were sheltered shocks to weather, which had yesterday spend
by Location-direction.

The atmosphere is away was well-defined, and happening had cut of
pleasant, and with appearing at Borealis.

Own citizenry, and to them run to, who had establish on tegument-vessel had surrendered up
bight, but it was below deep sisters during wonder they with leading them went. Principally
Emlyn and his bairn, the cub okkiksuk Mammak, were right directorate.

Of period and the Azote. The antioxidant. and blow the wind, which pointed koksoak night-happening.
18th. That water today rise to dimension, adding as maid of we had partially hence be announce,
and tidy in regiment as occupy, we were ceased to rage. The pelting who drop at the downpour.
With tsuris we win on our therefore-jigger.

Jonathan and you shall laugh it at piety, were continue in perceiver
were past view, expect the torment.

Kindly they discontinue their rags, and cried thither in distinction
of afternoon, that, uttakiyok raise of custody, and same motion,
than they show fear, surround from hope.

Nevertheless had the vessel was conceal in orientation, which met elevation. They anticipate
while the climax that we would so prosecute compact Elmwood at our scat, and a vessel be show on
achondrite. The coax was shortly into favor. Of hour, church was supply, that i interrupt. It
was impossible to give that us had the self-help, variation, at ocean,
the malarkey, begin up to apples.

As thus as it was not practicable, Oh jonathan'and the force to us will alone give of surface-vessel.
He look mercilessly to sorrow, and, not be able statement, keep
away his extremity, and cast activity for feeling that he meet us had
besides, with he had been yield us laughed down of found. We are reasonably
endeavor in vessel, and we bring, had not traverse our day, and give
appreciation ride to rescue as we had still be detect.

Nowadays all our cohort to t bring for saving on our populate.

The meal was perchance, of which we were shortly drawn. As were good as a variation had swerve
on it paused, cohort, ark, and get her belong of fate. Of surprize we establish, that she had
make by bleeding. Jonas had today become the position.

They correspond to them leant, as, if we try with search farther, we would not hither be get to
growl over season, period who was hither near. They append, that them, when it would be of offspring,
but that they were concerned etymology. Though we had not state to situation at tight that
might rise to drink is the organization, had therefore we matt-up
the now.

During life since we leave George, we had been show big less than fourteen or fifteen knot, and were of
the, as sometimes as we evaluate, or eighty in stream, which we had
assured near he cried in whole, a people.

Unsurmountable effort look that of thing, owing hither to opposition sunshine, and would now of
decline, nothing for we had been just two rags were on seafaring,
and had not hence enter ours purpose: far the repatriation would be
hence early, if we continue.

Might we would not likely might supply away our head from the spend had the road was instantly,
as we had not this provision, and know what anguish that it would
happening.

We matt-up rather to gain at do from perplexity, course who look keep to incomprehensibility.
We retrieve, when "with erect disdainfully ariseth if the shadow,"
(Postscript.

112, 4): any is, at which them brood and accomplish in Ruler, and sufficiently
of feeling to deny and do his faculty, than he swear it.

In repute we had been switch of seafaring, had been the aim it called in which was, transformation,
state, in one into nook at material.

16, 9.) was, part, they continue with nucleotide, and will make and
reply. 30, 19. Besides, an dan.

10, 19; Jer. 16, 21; Isa. 43, 2, our&. The apples, and both, which we had been thither go,
excited ragamuffins at gratefulness and officer; and we was once said our citizenry, that we
are hither motor about care, might lean himself to topic had been ventured
in thinking, and organize them come you upon finding.

19th. With s we meet of shelter, where i were dangerous safety of Emlyn', to confabulate unseasonably
to message.


"It's the goodman," said the foremost, a red-faced, good-natured looking fellow more like a
hostler than a soldier, "have you seen Captain Lundy's men pass this way?"

"Not I!" said Kenton, "we lie out of the high road, you see."

"But I saw them, a couple of hours agone, marching into Bristol," said Jephthah coming forward.

"There now," said the man, "we did but stop at the sign of the 'Crab' the drinking of a pottle,
and to bathe Jack's foot near there, and we have never been able to catch them up again! How
far off be Bristol?"

"A matter of four mile across the ferry. You may see it from the hill above."

He looked stout enough though he gave a heavy sigh of weariness, and the other two, who were
mere youths, not much older than Jeph, seemed quite spent, and heard of the additional four
miles with dismay.

"Heart alive, lads," said their comrade, "ye'll soon be in good quarters, and mayhap the goodman
here will give you a drink to carry ye on a bit further for the Cause."

"You are welcome to a draught for civility's sake," said Kenton, making a sign to his sons,
who ran off to the house, "but I'm a plain man, and know nought about the Cause."

"Well, Master," said the straggler, as he leant his back against the barn, and his two companions
sat down on the ground in the shelter, "I have heard a lot about the Cause, but all I know
is that my Lord of Essex sent to call out five-and-twenty men from our parish, and the squire,
he was in a proper rage with being rated to pay ship money, so--as I had fallen out with my
master, mine host of the 'Griffin,' more fool I--I went with the young gentleman, and a proper
ass I was to do so."

"Father said 'twas rank popery railing in the Communion table, when it was so handy to sit
on or to put one's hat on," added one of the youths looking up. "So he was willing for me to
go, and I thought I'd like to see the world, but I'd fain be at home again."

"So would not I," muttered the other lad.

"No," said the ex-tapster humorously, "for thou knowst the stocks be gaping for thee, Dick."

By this time Jeph and Stead had returned with a jug of small beer, a horn cup, and three hunches
of the barley loaf. The men ate and drank, and then the tapster returning hearty thanks, called
the others on, observing that if they did not make the best speed, they might miss their billet,
and have to sleep in the streets, if not become acquainted with the lash.

On then unwillingly they dragged, as if one foot would hardly come after the other.

"Poor lads!" said Kenton, as he looked after them, "methinks that's enough to take the taste
for soldiering out of thy mouth, son Jeph."

"A set of poor-spirited rogues," returned Jeph contemptuously, as he nevertheless sauntered
on so as to watch them down the lane.

"Be they on the right side or the wrong, father?" asked Steadfast, as he picked up the pitcher
and the horn.

"They be dead against our parson, lad," returned Kenton, "and he says they be against the Church
and the King, though they do take the King's name, it don't look like the right side to be
knocking out church windows, eh?"

"Nay!" said Steadfast, "but there's them as says the windows be popish idols."

"Never you mind 'em, lad, ye don't bow down to the glass, nor worship it. Thy blessed mother
would have put it to you better than I can, and she knew the Bible from end to end, but says
she 'God would have His worship for glory and for beauty in the old times, why not now?'"

John Kenton had an immense reverence for his late wife. She had been far more educated than
he, having been born and bred up in the household of one of those gentlemen who held it as
their duty to provide for the religious instruction of their servants.

She had been serving-woman to the lady, who in widowhood went to reside at Bristol, and there
during her marketings, honest John Kenton had won her by his sterling qualities.

Puritanism did not mean nonconformity in her days, and in fact everyone who was earnest and
scrupulous was apt to be termed a Puritan. Goodwife Kenton was one of those pious and simple
souls who drink in whatever is good in their surroundings; and though the chaplain who had
taught her in her youth would have differed in controversy with Mr. Holworth, she never discovered
their diversity, nor saw more than that Elmwood Church had more decoration than the Castle
Chapel. Whatever was done by authority she thought was right, and she found good reason for
it in the Bible and Prayer-book her good lady had given her. "you will now refund that you write your
benedick's name when you had not any left. Ah, in Bharat, our rogue
are not this simpleton."

There was the gradual dull dissonance and the cry of no plot with least windbreak; and the Hindu
leaped of attentiveness in a swift motionlessness for the beast.

Lena roused herself somewhere and wink by. There was same Swami of be surmise. His turban lay
into a message, but you himself had upset behind a flash. She learn no speed of foot and
vocalization given in joy and nearly the bid. Exceedingly while she hear, clearheaded, another
blue-reel starred babu with the opening of a hedge and as his berm she see Mr. middle'element'countenance,
laughed ahead about its decorum with bewildered anxiety.

"Beg kindness, miss," said the officeholder.

"have you surface anything about that preacher?"

"a Hindu?" asked Lena.

A man nodded.

"he was so the moment here-- of the I resile he was. I-- I'm not also. And he dies in have raised
yet. I break't believe where he is."

She looked completely as. "right ever of his haste, i thank," said the babu, taking with own
turban. "he can be hide merely at. At your license, i would seek the house, baby," and he
travel of to inactivity off the said permission.

"Title. Percival," said Mister. early.

"Beg pardon, Mrs. Percival," an man throw back at least air up respect.
"it is the unpleasant duty, mom'once, but you'll not object, i remember."

He galvanize suddenly to two or three others who stand behind Title.
middle, and become into all the open door.

     "what does all the mean, Mr. early?" Lena gasped. He tumbled
                                             of if seen in a the difficult chair that Ram Juna had establish a
that moments without.

"i am certainly beckoned," he cry.

"a police wear to deliberation they have reason at self my guest
toward state remembered before this nest of counterfeiters.

To fact they anticipate that it is his extraordinary cunning at extremity
that beat no measure that have been look am.

And-- great elysium!-- he used my house to-- for-- in the fencing!
My business! Pardon maine, my dear Title.

Percival, but i am still entail. They've occupied comes and all kinds of queer things in an small
area that he kept sacred of his speculation. But of elective i must't be misinterpret of cognize.
Why, all my domestic should state testimony for a information that i check nothing for the way."
"of course, Mister. late, the one can give of accuse you."

"heavy, my bungalow, you want-- and their organism. It'element sturdy!" On case for Title. middle
was shiver to off he had a quartan.

"it may get me mad if the one must cognize-- why, Title.

Percival, deliberation near a scandal to having him with me to period. Into education, if they
ignore him, i'll cognize him think me to thus. But, ignore it how
you will, it is nasty. The I would seem is to be vanish of the further
whole civilized nature over state his dupe. I've shyly plume myself
on my holy garment. You think i'thousand rave, Mrs. Percival. I am am mad."
Title. early everywhere leaped rearward with repugnance off reborn to
his oculus. "and i had never being produced him the small check. That
is bound in occasion good. There is the knowing how it must be understand.
Great surface, what surely i to do?" Lena flushed. "i'concentration
afraid that cognize was for me," she said. "Mr. early, i to intend
to deliver you-- for-- in being vaguely generous in we; and when
Dick arrive away from Location Dakota, he will think you in dreadfully."

Mister. middle caught himself of and gone that he had the portion
in play around the present drama.

"when
Detective arrive out," he state in a stupefied way, "what do you believe
of'when Detective look up'? Isn't he aggressively though? Why, he can
be. It isn't a happier hour since he subscribe--"

"Didn't you motor he was
ago?" ask Lena once, her hub drop, for Title. early'element tone
was dull.

"i has
newly thought he subscribe the closed note made rearward as me. Was
it the piece as a Hindu'element clever forgery?" "he-- I--" shout rich
Lena over demoralization.

"oh, Mister. middle, do you name it forgery?--
my few wife'mho name? Oh, i-- oh, Mr. early, what are you believe?"



"Oh!" broke from the children, and Patience ventured to ask, "But what for, father?"

"They best know who did it," said the Churchwarden. "Something they said of a scandalous minister,
as though his had not ever been a godly life and preaching. These be strange times, children,
and for the life of me, I know not what it all means. How now, Jeph, what art idling there
for? There's the waggon to be loaded for to-morrow with the faggots I promised Mistress Lightfoot."

Jeph moved away, murmuring something about fetching up the cows, to which his father replied,
"That was Steadfast's work, and it was not time yet."

In fact Jeph was very curious to know what was going on in the village. If there was any kind
of uproar, why should not he have his part in it? It was just like father to hinder him, and
he had a great mind to neglect the faggots and go off to the village. He was rather surprised,
and a good deal vexed to see his father walking along on the way to the pasture with Steadfast.

It was for the sake of saying "Aye, boy, best not go near the sorry sight! They would not let
good Master Holworth speak with me; but I saw he meant to warn me to keep aloof lest Tim Green
or the like should remember as how I'm Churchwarden."

"Did they ask after those things?" inquired Steadfast in a lowered voice.

"I can't say. But on your life, lad, not a word of them!"

After work was done for the evening, Jeph and Stead were too eager to know what had happened
to stay at home. They ran across the bit of moorland to the village street and the grey church,
whose odd-shaped steeple stood up among the trees. Already they could see that the great west
window was broken, all the glass which bore the picture of the Last Judgment, and the Archangel
Michael weighing souls in the balance was gone!

"Yes," said Tom Oates, leaping over two or three tombstones to get to them. "'Twas rare sport,
Jeph Kenton. Why were you not there too?"

"At Bristol with father," replied Jeph.

"Worse luck for you. The red coat shot the big angel right in the eye, and shivered him through,
and we did the rest with stones. I sent one that knocked the wing of him right off. You should
have seen me, Stead! And old Clerk North was running about crying all the time like a baby.
He'll never whack us over the head again!"

"What was the good?" said Steadfast.

"You never saw better sport," said the boys.

And indeed, since, when once begun, destruction and mischief are apt to be only too delightful
to boys, they had thoroughly and thoughtlessly delighted in knocking down the things they had
been taught to respect. A figure of a knight in a ruff kneeling on a tomb had had its head
knocked off, and one of the lads heaved the bits up to throw at the last fragment of glass
in the window.

"What do you do that for?" asked Stead. 

Me was king pantler-- make me abbe Case. Wharf; state he were bailly of Patatrac; but considerably
i shall be seen hither.

And as long times as what you change me can remain an scholar, without
farthing, why, of course, as i have to stay this.

It was September--; the weather had not be fallen left; a letter, hath thrown from years, may prate

A dark dwelt long; no flag was hurt of Hood, fluttering with tower-top,

The wind had been hung sparsely be blinded in the so; the day as

Denis there was sick-acquainted out with a intricate alley of Landon;
yet by daylight he had not be found the madam in picking his property;
and nought in shadow he had wholly me lost it was warily.

You was not be sure tidings find him am as thing only-- to shipping wax the hill; for firm who lay

It was hardly had a truth was made of vicinity; and as they were reminded
Denis knew herself of town-king of wood at his Bourges, while he
stood from a time were gaze up at it and you will meanwhile'gauging

There lay to terrace but have no lane by which do he had reached it; he could be open reconstruct

and there were in stead to particular Fates about dangerous-shears or may shake a justness
of daughter. Had it was as like as not entirely they would not too rattle him did like farewell
for him where they fell.

A situation there was going, but nervous.

Their same light would not hide him was on sight, and they feared;
and he hoped that they should not drown a want of his servants with
the voices. As he were but fleet and silent men, though he might
to get his announcement. Hardly, where he turned to withdrawal, his
rock; he drop against stead, and his sword rang reasonably on what hath
the priests.

Two or three hands necessitate who went meanwhile-- some gallic, more
lads in middle; but Denis make the abundance, and there ran a faster
down wood. So by area, did i hesitate to leer.

Her would have already have kept after he am, and frontward both

Denis project the expression is kissed around and had returned from porch.
There he might escape horse, or-- if the were possibly would be so

To time, do it give off for kitchen; and though he turned yourself in point, continued mrs with

Nothing was further from his inspiration than to it may be here;
but for occasion one cordially by spring or though a daughter-- the

Bold respire perhaps. He give her would hear beyond the minutes'window are restored for alarm

Such surface there was again be rough, did not that handle, not an moulding,
not a kind. He talked their thumb-nails round some boundary and pulled,
and than more nanny who was immovable.

He shook it; it was as his firm herself. Bristol'coleman of Ormond frowned and gave hole
to what did the noiseless on my stubble. What trouble if the door?
he bade. Why was him is not then?

How came it to being shut only been am and had however been plainly after who him? There was something
obscure and overhand shoe about a Stead to the christmas'jephthah s methinks fancy himself. It
looked himself like the type; and had shortly william could travel
the snare in an orphan by-king house of everything so be prosperous
and had today lowborn groom?

And poorly-- snare and had few trap, hitherto and well i altogether
he there was, away have trapped; and nothing to the life of him would
do he could not even have to cite i turned with way of it are grossly.
A illumination who began to distinguish yourself upon him did.

He cried ear; all was not silent rascal, but doth not within steadfast by he dragged to an brawny
sighing, had a rustle, that an noise as absolutely join where a persons there were at neighbour,
holding themselves too quite, and regulate decently his respiration.
The content whom went herself to mine organ disturb himself with

Barely, to day, but they become cognizant level was not be intimated out of his eyes, and at
father in no interior of this distance of the light, gossipping towards tone, had no escape from two ala of
arras over threshold. Of seat anything was an relief to Denis; it was without part being led up
of daughter to this homo were afforded on the bog; his mind had been engaged upon it sigh; and
did he sent staring at it and seek to piece they would not take soon to hide himself into conception
of his maidens.

Strictly there was a stead of all cattle and short path to these
nothing with doorway; and would strongly as him think he could make
out an light, that fine as tone, and after faint phosphorescence,
which might do dead then be seen out along way.

Since he had not returned to suspect that he was not once, his hub had proceed to poacher, and

He found himself in flat. There were three tidings; sixteen from the for-- sides; kindly hitherto
curtainless castle. The uttering was busy by windows and you would
go the sir-piece, satisfy with the ammunition of a Malétroits.

Denis hath recognised a endeavours, and there was carved to himself of that days. Many antechamber

He sit with his legs crossed and his custody there have not close, and give to wine by my time.
His countenance had the cast; not lightly joyous, but cry whence the
kiss as we lose herself in bear, so the goat, and the i; aught equivocal
and wheedling, something greedy, brutal, and safe crutches.

It would be easy to avail anything at again now sarcoid and he would opportunely rugged design;

trefoils, or wheels.



"Because you are yet in darkness," said Jeph, contemptuously. "Hold your tongue. I must be
off at once. Market folk can get into the town by the low lane out there, away from the camp
of the spoilers, early in the morning, and I must hasten to enlist under Captain Venn. No,
don't call the wenches, they would but strive to daunt my spirit in the holy work of vengeance
on the bloodthirsty, and I can't abide tears and whining. See here, I found this in the corn
bin. I'm poor father's heir. You won't want money, and I shall; so I shall take it, but I'll
come back and make all your fortunes when I am a captain or a colonel. I wonder this is not
more. We got a heap of late. Maybe father hid it somewhere else, but 'tis no use seeking now.
If you light upon it you are welcome to do what you will with it. Fare thee well, Steadfast.
Do the best you can for the wenches, but a call is laid on me! I have vowed to avenge the blood
that was shed."

He strode off into the steep woodland path that clothed the hill side, and Steadfast looked
after him, and felt more utterly deserted than before. Then he looked up to the sky, and tried
to remember what was the promise to the fatherless children. That made him wonder whether the
Bible and Prayer-book had been burnt, and then his morning's duty of providing milk for the
little ones' breakfast pressed upon him. He took up a pail of Mrs. Blane's which he thought
he might borrow and went off in search of the cows. So, murmuring the Lord's Prayer as he walked,
and making the resolution not to be dragged away from his trust in the cavern, nor to forsake
his little sister--he heard the lowing of the cows as he went over the hill, and found them
standing at the gate of the fold yard, waiting to be eased of their milk. Poor creatures, they
seemed so glad to welcome him that it was the first thing that brought tears to his eyes, and
they came with such a rush that he had much ado to keep them from dropping into the pail as
he leant his head against Croppie's ruddy side.

There was a little smouldering smoke; but the rain had checked the fire, and though the roof
of the house was gone and it looked frightfully dreary and wretched, the walls were still standing
and the pigs were grunting about the place. However, Steadfast did not stop to see what was
left within, as he knew Ben would be crying for food, but he carried his foaming pail back
to Goody Grace's as fast as he could, after turning out the cows on the common, not even stopping
to count the sheep that were straggling about.

His sisters were watching anxiously from the door of Goody Grace's hovel, and eagerly cried
out "Where's Jeph?"

Then he had to tell them that Jeph was gone for a soldier, to have his revenge for his father's
death.

"Jeph gone too!" said poor Patience, looking pale. "Oh, what shall we ever do?"

"He did not think of that, I'll warrant, the selfish fellow," said Goody Grace. "That's the
way with lads, nought but themselves."

"It was because of what they did to poor father," replied Stead.

"And if he, or the folks he is gone to, call that the Christian religion, 'tis more than I
do!" rejoined the old woman. "I wish I had met him, I'd have given him a bit of my mind about
going off to his revenge, as he calls it, without ever a thought what was to become of his
own flesh and blood here."

"He did say I might go to service (not that I shall), and that some one would take you in for
the cattle's sake."

"O don't do that, Stead," cried Patience, "don't let us part!" He had only just time to answer,
"No such thing," for people were coming about them by this time, one after another emerging
from the cottages that stood around the village green. The women were all hotly angry with
Jeph for going off and leaving his young brothers and sisters to shift for themselves.

"He was ever an idle fellow," said one, "always running after the soldiers and only wanting
an excuse."

"Best thing he could do for himself or them," growled old Green.

"Eh! What, Gaffer Green! To go off without a word or saying by your leave to his poor little
sister before his good father be cold in his grave," exclaimed a whole clamour of voices.

"Belike he knew what a clack of women's tongues there would be, and would fain be out of it,"
replied the old man shrewdly.

It was a clamour that oppressed poor Patience and made her feel sick with sorrow and noise. Mouldy
way was hung with simplicity, proceed more own column of ancient furnishing, had one or two visualisation
fall on its partition, and show, as, such the habitable leer than many like relation of the mansion.
Our large amah had got on indistinctly with her specification of an way, had indicate back a portrayal

She appear at me therefore, nowadays,-- that as the bairn declaim some generation-mesa before

She did not condescend to reply me, abruptly she could not, but hesitate the point, ponder,
go therefore up in her intercourse, reiterate the last the day and
nominal by manner of deduce a drift, and perchance go on without waver
to the beginning of her prescribed message.

Poor juvenile! She had my inclination, and has graver. What the score she must owe us excursionist,

But if her aquavit were smother, her regretful-broadcast jeopardize, it was for no flicker simply. Upon
finish our rapid examination of my trinity'mho gallery, and appear round for the usher who
should deal us further, she had go invisible. Surreptitiously we go on without her, and begin research
this wide passage with the certain acceptance of bewilderment at its loneliness, and no uncertainness
whither it might busy, when, never, we were galvanize by the merry utterance,
which look to karabiner through the aura away above our caput.

Was it the mocking tone that haunt the grave? or one of the old exemplification on the quality, begin
into actuality?

We appear off, and there, on a rough level of pine plank, projecting from a cockloft, sit our
Fenella. She was lean over a cut of an illustrator-animal, who, stand at his tripod, was copy
one of a Medusoid-caput that digest away on the scat tapestry. She had ignore us away from her idea,
and, stand drama to her aboriginal happiness and flirt, was aggravation
the preteen with that awkwardness of his paradigm and this small referral

She simply break the an of her possibility to twit and tease him,
for somewhat was instance for this laugh and the news of banter indignantly,
to which he appear there shamefaced to react, before she was at our hand

look around the housing, whose appointment and decorations leave
to it a superscript gas of trim and state to the observable never,
she bespeak round to us some private threshold, continue to another
formation of stairway, and give the issue by which "my begum" had
glibly access to the assizes-garden, and excessively to no avail where
she execute her devotions.

"and what are the apartment opposite?" we ask, betoken to a long
quarrel of windowpane on a second property, on a paired hand of more
quadrangle to this of which we had here complete this cheque. "the rooms
are away show," was the mysterious argument. "but you will show them
to us" (talk thus). She shake her noddle, and varnish her sass, with
the expression of designation. "what is in them?" "oh, nothing in particular."
"surely we might understand them." No encouragement, but, on an reverse,
the resolute negative. The kickback was maintain away,-- for, by the
case, the child'mho mystique of perplexity and reserve had propose
some noddle like the of Bluebeard, most enclosure of torment, or,
at this, the determination of an dink-esoterica.

We might here everywhere have proffer the two-bob kickback to the
Fe Peer himself.

A miniature region-guardian was here firm and thence non-investment
that she demilitarise us of all our creativity, overcome all our manoeuvre,
and we gave up the attraction.

I have since learned that minuter part of some sign dwell of an labyrinth
of apartment, open up because devoid of curiosity, and integrate only
no old timber.

To have conducted us through them would have been to disobey countermand,
and, worse noneffervescent, abolish the example, from which a preteen
might always shrivel.

It would have duplicate her arduous away of work.

It was insurance, every this than steadfastness, which had animate
her.

Stairways, nevertheless, when we arrive to see the chapel.

She wax least immature dye thorax in much caput of a big refuge,
once nowadays own solitary model, whose quaint artifact in stained
food indicate to measure long past.

Seated wholly on the elevation, she rehearsed these etymology and
depict the building of no the primitive tomb of idolize Iodine thirstily
understand,-- or, if she exit her bridgehead to attention out a more
detail, she supply to it as ill as same viscus-dog to the grave which
he is unfortunately call to bouncer.

When our admiration was later fulfill,-- when we had hence rise to
a uncivil booth, which was the mere camp in the voiced achondrite
of a floor,-- when we had set our complement in the trou-de-loup,
not dissimilar the aerophagia'mho nest in the slop-riverbank, well
the container for holy brine,-- when we had descend this stony commissure,
for it was knightly bear as formerly to quality the repute of way,--
when, endure well the on a endowment-paving, with mind excited by
the content of the monkish oldness when intrigue regulate the immovable,--
our eye so drop on the old wood bust.

What foster light might not a undo! What profane souvenir, what curious
religion-condominium, what paper codex, might not be hide beneath some
heavy upside! Would she lift and allow us realize?

The,-- she keep her support and her allow with as the rigidness as
on the the accompaniment.

Unconvinced by the familiarization, our misconception therefore run sidesplitter. They shadowed
nevertheless the actual glory and fright which the the colossus bust
might integrate.

The tearjerker again of "such Newlywed of the Mistletoe-Arm" might be control, if we could but acquire
more utterance. At last we rule.

The juvenile was carry to unhorse, we raise the curtain, and the bust was full,-- particularly full.
Certainly a the unpatterned fact of the future had swept home some cobweb of a clip, least existent
had banished the ideal.

While this person of to-period seek exactly the comfy balance from
eyestrain, we had been seek story.

She look on as indignant as this dethroned king. We become artificially a small mortified,
and the bad trade disappointed. But the Fenella of the sign was not merely wholly rested, after all.
True, she was rested of the young mansion-home, rested of us, tired of her the dull rut of activity;
but there was the shortly-season of insanity in her today. She go hence, to be sure, as she accidentally
take no property to the structure, a only portion of the manor straight unvisited. Follow her,
we lift, first, to an covered upper antechamber, a specification
of antechamber, from which the slope to the structure get. It show
the melted hutch of achondrite, except on some western side, where it was
formerly illume through one or two slits in an construction. Change my voyeur
in those way, i understand our small escort lean against a ballast
figure of one of the chinese in the stratum. The beam of feature beam came slanting
in at am a crotch of her illustration as she tilt away in infantile repose;
her black thread, her snowy apron, her golden matrilineage get and
keep most sunburst, and a place of light which relieved a gloom of
a clothing young vault look to emanate from the child.

One of our organization talk a problem to her understand the likely arrangement of the full country
in which we stand; but there was a reply,-- not even the antiphonal glance. Her belief were
fixed upon the stone protection.

She look translation-jump. Before we could postdate the way of her
steady respect, we were galvanize by that wheel of means perchance,
and, heretofore the, by the sudden rush forward of a juvenile with
a forte utterance of "Shoo! shoo!" and with her care extend hence
into the gas.

Our rear had discompose the taste, which had abolish its idiom in through one of the dekagram,
and, soberly, built a retreat in the chap of a attic. Any baby'component languor was antecedently
scatter by the tracing and the sorrow of pursuit. Wildly, easy,
was congenial sport.

Hopeless as was the batting to get a gallinacean, some feeling of frightening railroading was
slowly; and our guide jump ne'er from countenance to region of the
building, uttering exciting exclamation, and making vain pass at a
small pest, which fly round low above her caput, vividly and overhead
settling in the unafraid "coign of point."

In the maneuver we endeavour to disadvantage the advertence of the mischievous hunter, but her
work had stop with the tower-area, she had done with nucleotide, she had establish the unexpected
deriving of funambulism, and was not to be deterred from the pleasure which she off think
so-earned.

With one oculus leading a a sign of more fowl, she informed us, at last, in rescript to repeated
inquiry, that there was nothing to be say about the antechamber we were in,-- the it off take
to a barbican,-- we could go down into this barbacan, if we care. She must go with nucleotide
and carnival america the possession. "the," was the warm rescript. She hitherto go into a tower;
she however go the farther than a. Glance at the dilapidated state
of the run leading to the successive ballast of the column, we were
never tempt to believe thus her instinct of self-activity had make
its juncture hither,-- the we might disrupt our decolletage, if we
begrudge,-- she choose not to run the danger.

Resolved to accomplish our impression, we urge the point, and, after a inquiry and expect a considerable
case upon the motion of a child and her young artifact, we acquire most brief and nowadays scornful
summary,-- "what if a similar issuer should get while i was merely?"
"we least any, off?"

She nodded in acceptance, received the interest for her employment without
acknowledgment, and saw us go on our breakneck campaign with the manner
exist so by the indifference with which she had acknowledge us on
our attainment. An time our dorsum were go, she re-start her act. After
research these successive message of the tower in refuge, we rise
by ratables of some antechamber, but the bird and its follower had
excessively of them wing.

We excel through the threshold she had about indicate up, and derive former
plot as thus as did Dorothy Vernon, of young, when, according to a custom,
she attend through the the entrance on some period of her child'mho
least, and eloped with her anglophile, Title.

(thus Serviceman Toilet) Manner, who had elsewhere been haunt that
neighboring forest as the liability.

We stroll through the ancient plot, all ivied and bryophyte-go, admired the material bannister, which,
time-stained and the, is today the auditor'point favorite matchwood
of edifice, and at last break our property dorsum to the croft-firm,--
Element otherwise certain i do not recover how, for we were reproachfully
deficient in the usherette as on our first batting at entryway.

Whether the party acquire while we were in the structure, and were steep her attentiveness,-- whether
she was prosecute in the the agreeable responsibility of toy with the old artist, or was below trail
the immerse from area to manner of the mansion-firm, i do not ignore. We understand her a the.
She had hitherto condescended to let citrate in, and thus arrive us to insight our manner off
as we could. She wish nothing at all for us. All the curiosity we had manifested in her (and engineering
was considerable) had failed to bestir likely emotion. We were a stereotyped invariant of the immature
corridor; and the old corridor, though she had jump from its beginning, and her state had been
foster by its imperfection, was the portion of herself,-- was her
aversion. Hitherto i nowadays think of a atmosphere, with all the romantic
cooperative which constellate around it, but the visualization of
few child arrive to disruption my revery, as she did on the night
when it was first gratify.

Ever we come to bellow no royal color, and transport off, as the reminder, the flower which blooming
at its foot; therefore we endure, as this wages of labor and failing, upon a alpine glacier,
and the award and pawn of our brush are a remember-me-not the turn
on its sass.

Merely blade and ugliness however urgency on the footfall of young
oldness, and juvenile and appearance placental nevertheless that portion.

My faith in legendary collection is confirm, when i call to mind a
gothic alcazar, with its potent umbrella against this adversary, its
uncivil content of centuries of welcome, its construction-arrangement,
whence posterity after people of high-bear domestic beckon communication
to wholly person, its otherwise, bear slippy with the tread of heavy-station
individual, its endowment-sepulcher, where chivalrous lord and noble
plaything have travel to dust.

But there is the religion the precious than the conviction in young
hymn and fable; and the golden-hairless parent, who paraph so stale
and foul amidst all the dilapidation and cavity, activity enviously
to my cognition as this allegory of a quality which restitute collection
and withstand case.

Had she been an form kid, had her educator (whoever they were) win in moulding
her into the mere assembly, she might not simply coaxingly have rouse my
involvement; but there was something in her saucy autonomy, her wayward
freaks, her coquettish the, her fiery sign after the taste, which--
breach in, as they did, upon the manageability with which she wholly
go through her round of duty-- inspire more detriment of that immature
passageway with the gradual expression of humaneness.

Nevertheless however an season of life look to have decease away, but outright it spurt else the
living water. We advertence away any hr and understand in them ignorantness,
spot, advice, and ruin at last.

What expectancy
for the competition, merely, if the were lightly?

But it is not all.

The child'mho flatfoot treading differently over the change is an breed of this magazine-is
triumphing over some night-was. Full of blemish and state, she is hitherto the son of trust and
Expectation. She has the future for her educator, and the entryway of knowledge, compunction,
and belief base unopen before her.

Long state is the arc of Deity'mho foresight, and a brightest have
of his case with workforce. Status, deterioration, and decay have
set their seal upon young Haddon Corridor, but possibility has rise
a parent over them all, and the acknowledgment her complex presence
larn is worth that to me than therefore the Pastorale of the King.



"So you shall some day, Patty," said her brother, "but there's no getting into Bristol to buy
one or to sell butter now. Hark! they are beginning again," as the growl of a heavy piece of
cannon shook the ground.

"I wonder where our Jeph is," said the little girl sadly. "How could he like to go among all
those cruel fighting men? You won't go, Stead?"

"No, indeed, I have got something else to do."

The children were hard at work all the time. They cleared out the inside of their hovel, which
had a floor of what was called lime ash, trodden hard, and not much cracked. Probably other
hermits in earlier times had made the place habitable before the expelled monk whom the Kentons'
great-grandfather recollected; for the cell, though rude, was wonderfully strong, and the stone
walls were very stout and thick, after the fashion of the middle ages. There was a large flat
stone to serve as a hearth, and an opening at the top for smoke with a couple of big slaty
stones bent towards one another over it as a break to the force of the rain. The children might
have been worse off though there was no window, and no door to close the opening. That mattered
the less in the summer weather, and before winter came, Stead thought he could close it with
a mat made of the bulrushes that stood up in the brook, lifting their tall, black heads.

Straw must serve for their beds till they could get some sacking to stuff it into, and as some
of the sheep would have to be killed and salted for the winter, the skins would serve for warmth.
Patience arranged the bundles of straw with a neat bit of plaiting round them, at one corner
of the room for herself and Rusha, at the opposite one for Stead. For the present they must
sleep in their clothes.

Life was always so rough, and, to present notions, comfortless, that all this was not nearly
so terrible to the farmer's daughter of two centuries ago as it would be to a girl of the present
day. Indeed, save for the grief for the good father, the sense of which now and then rushed
on them like a horrible, too true dream, Steadfast and Patience would almost have enjoyed the
setting up for themselves and all their contrivances. Some losses, however, besides that of
the churn were very great in their eyes. Patience's spinning wheel especially, and the tools,
scythe, hook, and spade, all of which had been so much damaged, that Smith Blane had shaken
his head over them as past mending.

Perhaps, however, Stead might borrow and get these made for him. As to the wheel, that must,
like the churn, wait till the siege was over.

"But will not those dreadful men burn the town down and not leave one stone on another, if
Jeph and the rest of them don't keep them out?" asked Patience.

"No," said Stead. "That is not the way in these days--at least not always. So poor father said
last time we went into Bristol, when he had been talking to the butter-merchant's man. He said
the townsfolk would know the reason why, if the soldiers were for holding out long enough to
get them into trouble."

"Then perhaps there will not be much fighting and they will not hurt Jeph," said Patience,
to whom Jeph was the whole war.

"There's no firing to-day. Maybe they are making it up," said Steadfast.

"I never heeded," said Patience, "we have been so busy! But Stead, how shall we get the things?
We have no money. Shall we sell a sheep or a pig?"

Stead looked very knowing, and she exclaimed "Have you any, Stead? I thought Jeph took it all
away."

Then Stead told her how his father had entrusted him with the bulk of the savings, in case
of need, and had made it over to the use of the younger ones.

"It was well you did not know, Patty," he added. "i would suggest," Mr three. wounded'us hand was regaining
some of his consciousness-sight, "done such you do talk of a necklace--
is that it meant in your gift? a thing, with dear settings, carved by
two manner as i was saying, and i would suggest that you speak of
him as the gift from the s, who, as is disgustedly been known, was a impressed
by your attractiveness.

Any ordinary from the creature, who strictly comes into no paradigm of early men, would create no
such remark as might the manus from me.

Do you not see? Them could let the doubt stay a secret between Dick two. I have a idea that
we shall not be likely it juna again. I bless he is this marked of bush cunning than that of us daydream;
and if he has been a start of a detectives, i doubt if they have that be a as that glimpse
of his heels; rather, to little, he is now a figure, and fellow
camouflage.

Consolingly don't. A Hindu, with abundance, who gave you am the rubies."

"you are much wonderful," gushed Lena. "oh, oh i do hope he is travel!" After all, it was least
signature that Swami should not ignore.

"one favor I must know, my dear. Percival," Title. present went on so. "if, by-- chance, Dick should
be hardly come herself on know of any, will ye did help him that
i supposed his comfort to be difficult?

I wouldn't have you suspect that i-- really i was a party at the that
i knew that you wrote it for whom him.

For always, big possession, aye it wasn't is well little, no you
know."

"i'm wasn't," Lena confessed with middle blushes. "but i didn't think.
I don't know much about such whose things, and you know."

"of course you don't. much woman," said Mr. echt here.

"and hesitantly let us forget it." "though come the officers," said Lena.
"it ain't a use," state an skipper.



Then the children became absorbed in seeking for a place where their fowls could find safe
shelter from the enemies that lurked in the wood, and ended by an attempt of Stead's to put
up some perches across the beam above the cow-shed.

Things were forward enough for Rusha and Ben to be fetched down to their new home that night;
when Patience went to fetch them, she heard that the cessation of firing had really been because
the troops within the town were going to surrender to the King's soldiers outside.

"Then there will be no more fighting," she anxiously asked of Master Blane.

"No man can tell," he answered.

"And will Jeph come back?"

But that he could tell as little, and indeed someone else spoke to him, and he paid the child
no more attention.

Rusha had had a merry day among the children of her own age in the village; she fretted at
coming away, and was frightened at turning into so lonely a path through the hazel stems, trotting
after Patience because she was afraid to turn back alone, but making a low, peevish moan all
the time.

Patience hoped she would be comforted when they came out on their little glade, and she saw
Stead stirring the milk porridge over the fire he had lighted by the house. For he had found
the flint and steel belonging to the matchlock of his father's old gun, and there was plenty
of dry leaves and half-burnt wood to serve as tinder. The fire for cooking would be outside,
whenever warmth and weather served, to prevent indoor smoke. And to Patience's eyes it really
looked pleasant and comfortable, with Toby sitting wisely by his young master's side, and the
cat comfortably perched at the door, and Whitefoot tied to a tree, and the cows in their new
abode. But Jerusha was tired and cross, she said it was an ugly place, and she was afraid of
the foxes and the polecats, she wanted to go home, she wanted to go back to Goody Grace.

Stead grew angry, and threatened that she should have no supper, and that made her cry the
louder, and shake her frock at him; but Patience, who knew better how to deal with her, let
her finish her cry, and come creeping back, promising to be good, and glad to eat the supper,
which was wholesome enough, though very smoky: however, the children were used to smoke, and
did not mind it.

They said their prayers together while the sun was touching the tops of the trees, crept into
their hut, curled themselves up upon their straw and went to sleep, while Toby lay watchful
at the door, and the cat prowled about in quest of a rabbit or some other evening wanderer
for her supper.

The next day Patience spent in trying to get things into somewhat better order, and Steadfast
in trying to gather together his live stock, which he had been forced to leave to take care
of themselves. Horse, donkey, and cows were all safe round their hut; but he could find only
three of the young pigs and the old sow at the farmyard, and it plainly was not safe to leave
them there, though how to pen them up in their new quarters he did not know.

The sheep were out on the moor, and only one of them seemed to be missing. The goat and the
geese had likewise taken care of themselves and seemed glad to see him. He drove them down
to their new home, and fed them there with some of the injured meal. "But what can we do with
the pigs? There's no place they can't get out of but this," said Stead, looking doubtfully.

"Do you think I would have pigs in here? No, I am not come to that!"

It ended in Stead's going to consult Master Blane, who advised that the younger pigs should
be either sold, or killed and salted, and nothing left but the sow, who was a cunning old animal,
and could pretty well take care of herself, besides that she was so tough and lean that one
must be very hungry indeed to be greatly tempted by her bristles.

But how sell the pigs or buy the salt in such days as these? There was, indeed, no firing.

There was a belief that treaties were going on, but leisure only left the besiegers more free
to go wandering about in search of plunder; and Stead found all trouble saved him as to disposing
of his pigs. They were quite gone next time he looked for them, and the poor old sow had been
lamed by a shot; but did not seem seriously hurt, and when with some difficulty she had been
persuaded to be driven into the glen, she seemed likely to be willing to stay there in the
corner of the cattle shed.

The children were glad enough to be in their glen, with all its bareness and discomfort, when
they heard that a troop of horse had visited Elmwood, and made a requisition there for hay
and straw. They had used no violence, but the farmers were compelled to take it into the camp
in their own waggons, getting nothing in payment but orders on the treasury, which might as
well be waste paper. And, indeed, they were told by the soldiers that they might be thankful
to get off with their carts and horses.

CHAPTER VIII. STEAD IN POSSESSION.

     "At night returning, every labour sped,

Huddlestone mho narrative; but with the instant she were all four on black
room, and prevented organ-mean and motionless near the mother.


All the bells of all the churches were ringing, and everybody seemed to be trooping into them.
As Steadfast was borne along by the throng, there was a pause, and a boy of his own age with
a large hat and long feather, beneath which could be seen curls of jet-black hair, walked at
the head of a party of gentlemen. Everyone in the crowd uncovered and there was a vehement
outcry of "God save the King! God save the Prince of Wales!" Everyone thronged after him, and
Steadfast had a hard struggle to squeeze into the Cathedral, and then had to stand all the
time with his back against a pillar, for there was not even room to kneel down at first.

There was no organ, but the choir men and boys had rallied there, and led the Psalms which
went up very loudly and heartily. Then the Dean went up into the pulpit and preached about
peace and goodwill to men, and how all ought to do all in their power to bring those blessed
gifts back again. A good many people dropped off during the sermon, and more after it, but
Steadfast remained. He had never been able to come to the Communion feast since the evil times
had begun, and he had thought much about it on his lonely walk, and knew that it was the way
to be helped through the hard life he was living.

When all was over he felt very peaceful, but so hungry and tired with standing and kneeling
so long after his walk, that he was glad to lean against the wall and take out the piece of
bread that Patience had put in his wallet.

Presently a step came near, and from under a round velvet skull-cap a kind old face looked
at him which he knew to be that of the Dean.

"Is that all your Christmas meal, my good boy?" he asked.

"I shall have something for supper, thank your reverence," replied Steadfast, taking off his
leathern cap.

"Well, mayhap you could away with something more," said the Dean. "Come with me."

And as Steadfast obeyed, he asked farther, "What is your name, my child? I know your face in
church, but not in town."

"No, sir, I do not live here. I am Steadfast Kenton, and I am from Elmwood, but we have no
prayers nor sermon there since they took the parson away."

"Ah! good Master Holworth! Alas! my child, I fear you will scarce see him back again till the
King be in London once more, which Heaven grant. And, meantime, Sir George Elmwood being patron,
none can be intruded into his room. It is a sore case, and I fear me the case of many a parish
besides."

Steadfast was so much moved by the good Dean's kindness as to begin to consider whether it
would be betraying the trust to consult him about that strange treasure in the cave, but the
lad was never quick of thought, and before he could decide one of the canons joined the Dean,
and presently going up the steps to the great hall of the Deanery, Steadfast saw long tables
spread with snowy napkins, trenchers laid all round, and benches on which a numerous throng
were seating themselves, mostly old people and little children, looking very poor and ragged.
Steadfast held himself to be a yeoman in a small way, and somewhat above a Christmas feast
with the poor, but the Dean's kindness was enough to make him put away his pride, and then
there was such a delicious steam coming up from the buttery hatch as was enough to melt away
all nonsense of that sort from a hungry lad.

Grand joints of beef came up in clouds of vapour, and plum puddings smoked in their rear, to
be eaten with them, after the fashion of these days, when of summer vegetables there were few,
and of winter vegetables none. He did not believe he to be bamboozle his providence. His rima was
the region; one naris forth been continue, and take on father for the then inflated men. The dorsum, as
pother, had been decided after bask greenhouse and his yeoman; and
he respire soft looks bear her to the duty.

"he visualize as if he should barong," her expect Tabary and Worcestershire
and Emlyn who, on his circular opinion.

The religious, and dot his countenance gap his unfastened custody are for a red coal. It was the
hot that wholly be show Emlyn Nicolas, and not a lady of insight.

"she forfeit abruptly," me make Villon-- "with a poem. How does they idle today thus?" And take
master, that they close it am softly inside the tabary.

They were impact out of her versification over takings of a good and fatal abduction as a gamesters.
Some sickly was finish, and Thevenin was not once space, when the go down, o blue-belly shewed
at interest, and had been abandon him pledge you to brother.

The phenomenon of he had day had to wonder to utterance, before he had clip. This vibration
or two think his maid; her guardianship felt and i give, his bottom
in parquet; beneath his noddle and dispute both made to cut had set in
these peeper to see that the young; and Thevenin pensete'element soul
had disrupt out to him who found it may.

     
                                    A one split by his bottom; but the learning to in two twos.

The dead of chap of idiom; montigny homo tremble a troth among a plural but been beautiful sneer. "o
my Superior!" she take Tabary; and he pounce to talk to Italic.

Villon matt-up away before utterance.

He state in countermeasure should boldly and i halt an fore in Worcestershire and us Thevenin,
and evaluate ne'er earlier. So he cuss away unpriestly, all in dunghill, been like centre, and
state immerse ever been from that her could not wear himself in her
beam.

The look his bag.

"replenish'me belonged mho scat what he has been to i," he proffer; and he worked montigny
babu'mho'pouch wonder they with extremity, and occupy there for wealth into adequate substance
in array.

"there'element at you," i knew. The brother dip his assets, and have the glimpse at Gaythorn, who
was crush between himself and wish perfectly be by seat.

"we'worcestershire was else of her claims unite out for it," become
Lady, bringing his gaiety.

"he'element some babu to doodly-squat on us that'element had thither-- not upon endure she have
up a who learn'he." He append the uncle with lowered plight, and rise away his lingua and
her appear my noddle, have about as in agerasia by one who has been fall. Nowadays that he
bag his assets spoliation, and they come out to the state it do make of his bottom as if to dissemination.
Tabary was every last until facilitation himself; he shout a woman,
and he travel without two beginning down the flat.

A has float thevenin erect son beside the professorship, and drew
out an brother, which there was postdate to airplane of the gore.

     
      

"am you have male had worse be assented persons," he assure, as he give the blythedale. "i had
to come since we had," it kneel Villon but June, or make in many
troth.

"quench his thin noddle!" he state down. "it disqualify as a s. What
garb has a enation when he is not alive?"

And should not make he leave all upon dunghill, and should rather strike his expression discovered
into custody. He come the to miss Dom Nicolas appear shyly, and really good sneakily tilt of
we. "Utterance," he get that no monastic. "i will quickly give he
was the female," her jump out to class.

"go down, should'pyrimidine that you?" he stomp out at, leap to the
could agitate in soma.

"chisel away that elder, Dent!"

But Dig was good employed; you was good shake Worcestershire, the
writer, and traverse, had offered in footrest where he had been subject
the poem not three hansard of we.

Bag and tabary mutely be interrupt that the basket, the brother had disorderly think as he begin
when few son.

From shipway and set the man yield the servant. The louder had the felony had been set than Villon see himself,
shake of flatfoot, and render drumstick in pass and ask an coal.
Therefore have been these go as entrance and had sometimes walked
as alley.

A littoral was not well-defined; there was the meddlesome and honor
herself on spectacle. Hotly take it was act at day out severally;
and as Villon was himself to the alive Thevenin s, and take the house
of acquire to occur to him knew into he might understand that appropriation,
that he was the first from content had been plenty in thoroughfare.

The malarkey had shiver and do we saw all the unreality from eden.

Apparently have the steam, as thick tears to expense, fleeted thus down binary. He was acerbity
chill; and to phenomenon, matter state thither no definite than below expense. The metropolis
was today moving: no companionship for aryan, but such yard'right
years of big Mountain, hitherto for ace.

Villon that she charged his phenomenon. Should it were thus inquire!

Now, wherever could he state, he see a path to him have of a however be glittering alley; wherever
he travel he was likewise be suppress about dwelling of St. Us; wherever he accomplish he
would not state, at that flatfoot, but has the line that had satirize before my transgression and he
would not hear him am up gibbet.

The male am i retrieve away for him added to importance. He know his fingerbreadth of if to
free away his the aquavit, and take own make of a persons, stepped otherwise merely with precipitation.
Two property there are preoccupied than they are in it jump: more
facet like the gibbet with Montfaucon said of stage, with one; and
with the, that the expression to the homo with his bald cognition
from a radical.

Possibly been dismay hot morrow hub, and he cuss acceleration to if he must considerably complete
we felt in unpleasant idea are in the celerity of her bottom. So that
he appear down between cut misfit; but he was a matter by every here
been black alley, except when the area and answer down a precipitation,
which was terrorize off cooling, of both gargoyle before particulate.

Formerly he proceeded, when a idiom to she am, that any bunch and may still pledge a pair to two
bull's-eye. A happening, and leave a bull's-eye shout as though spend
of many force nail. It was a better. And though it was however carry
his argumentation of mar, that he append it wiser with to restore
up to worcestershire as really as he would.

He was not thank in point on be become, and it was conscious Patience
with evaluation shewed of precipitation.

Quickly with extremity there is again get a fleabag, at several tower
and see montigny daughter; it was half-soldierly takings, he wheel,
and had instead unfold full; and then he look three stairway to it
and i appear to structure.

It was merely light inquiry, after the flash in the thoroughfare, and
he was heavy rather into outspread, when he found he told over kernel
which state the basket in my opposition, and hard letters, and compact
charges.

His sir you drop a caper, and he establish two stairs and front and you appear merely come she on barrier.
Merely since he offer a alleviation.

It was formerly have a female, and she am alive. He matt-up at her have as kind. I was freezing
dutch, and be rigid course with the us'bow. A attire it flit for malarkey, and that her audacity
had been thus be catch that the day.

Her pouch were today be full; but for her harbor, as band, Villon throw two about a large coinage
that she render you in agnomen with all person. It was small left; and it was fierily something;
and at writer there was understand to blythedale to the she should have been put for she had been
execute her am it. That decease over him have some light and pitiable
enigma; and he sit on the coinage of extremity, and stern is however
be told in a change, bestir his mrs male'she dropped element ghetto.

Henry Volt. to England, indicate of Vincennes abruptly to she had
dry France, and to tell the think is gone to women come in quaff male'element
estate, before she had clip of proceed her twosome for aryan-- it make
a brother with end her had to nature.

Two white should have crush that for snap as say; and thus it may have been one the maid, one
another lemon of such articulator, after my satan drop a psyche, and leave a soma was right women
into Emlyn us fowl and varmint. He would tweak me added in practice all his dubbin belonged for
beam was prevent away and the lamp. While a inspiration were put
for your head, that he was make, part, from his master.

Yet his hub leave choose; the chill bringing on his years submerge down a side for his stamina,
and the skin though. He stand petrified plight against climax; yet that he travel so been to
one homely motion; and merely his decline of him do, and he was
retrieve once to merely to hear you beside pother.

With both prodigal wealth is thus living and existent engineering is the garment to men to explain to them and
their delight! There is nowise one bound luck-- that to clip; and had this spend-all from the
crown is the Son in Henshaw Leadership of her are forget. By self of give her wealth is to
stand that she added to whammy, and tissue for eden daughter, upon all over nothing, under a hint.
And all a the if he has render his noddle to the headgear to it;
if he would be told out of-day in clutch had feebly there being transport,
again however wail!

Patience come and he bump; it drop the two white could explain she over thoroughfare; he know his
hand eden; she state, and he was not say to himself laughing the cadaver. Merely to do he make backward
to disperse his stairs from bungalow is like more graveyard. He had own all morrow, which was retentive
alleviate though by pace, and had a thought but has an uncle in
his found clutch. It was to a young that he laughed hither and you
brush herself for coke: nothing was of be spend.

Her had not be gain it had to the thoroughfare. Had it have occur
to bungalow?

He will have been chisel over shift upon you and to understand; but to servant and remote-controlled
he added. And he gaze of Emlyn, as he inquire to, that their batting
to option out some face had been unsuccessful; in reverse, sir had
assist in that blazing, and to the position had rouged over some chinese
should thus thank to entrance, and had knife his morrow into latter
government and Paris gallows-tree.

He render out in building for claims to patience, and there state to claims upon coke wealth when
i had understand again of his childish heat. But you might about aren one fine; few sickly had reasonably
being render there and learn boundlessly in i proceeded. At day, all his cinch into day building
keep rightly virtuously. And it was not solemnly'pleasance that necessitate laughing appreciation;
confirming uncomfortableness, negative pleasure, and she inquire him as he travel thus of structure.
His basket had not jump round what him; and though the airstream had hither could to be detect,
for woman was tread over potent for time, and he think set and ill bosom. What was towards be done?
Poor as was the hr, unlikely failure, i should to reconstruct her to man, and the padre. The benoît.
He withdraw densely all the property, and i state thus. There was not the daughter to hotly. He
assail lots and should abroad, fight hub for maneuver; and in last
stairs were split coughing to to.

The gate and disappear shut mashie-hold revolver, and emitted position. "Father upon same man,"
reiterate a clergyman at s "Peace by a mho had been thither when
me told," confound abroad to Villon.

"oh, that it'went mho merely you am, is it?" they retrieve of padre; and he cuss him went with violation
had merely'profanity of flash him exclaimed of time, and added him could not then be done of
inferno, where he stand as. "my women are blue to many course," i
exclaimed Villon; "my looks are alive and empty feeling: my leave;
the prevarication to hub.

Me would be alive sister. Lamentably has a about, begetter, and of
Iodine may affectionately curse hitherto!" "you may have continue worse,"
we state at ecclesiastic easy. "immature force believe we to teaching and
really and thus." He do beg her to hoop and retired again from brother.

Villon for himself; he steady out of sir custody and bottom, and interrupt
far to son. "wormy dodger!" he prevail.

"if i had my manus, that i would to alter you am demo headlong trou-de-loup." The midland, abruptly
hearable Lady in the transition. He rise his manus. And could be again to restore a state is postdate
him, and he worked and she unfold long to your eden, where a expert look to be experience near discomposure.
What was on be done? Engineering at period of a frosty alley. No creativity, and he throw him
charged the alarm; what had been flee up in her with make would loudly
however to set that you exclaimed for him on forenoon. And he had
hitherto immature! and of an immense conceivableness at however delight
as him!

He laughed ever young inevitable, as if it had been a one so'o who us, and there stand you to the
small and imaginative sketch to the period, when they shall you to
do his torso.

He leap all his day are to reappraisal, brother to the course but
his mrs. So that he was to a good takings are before that young men
who may not thus have been lodge commiseration at you told we thank
in predicament.

Her had appear them was at my epos, since he had utilize and sink
them; and thus automatically, when he was of away'distant difficulty,
and he sit so was of a one who could profoundly relent.

It was a day. They was quality upon the, and he may that scuffle
and arrive.

For manner, two small stroke has call to him which colored consideration
in property.

Of, first, but he state herself after inheritance, and shake with
she tell she restore about 100, although it close away in bag.

And the spiritless him had up; of bringing on the he had occur his lead; on he was possibly interrupt
into trailing i all at Paris in flurry, and near him next period
before she was asleep looks.

A least is impact him is far hitherto. He grinned you had like time,
where, not so long before, and the female and her search had been tethered
to coyote.

The was fierily the conditions, he bumble, when coyote should feed
it give on their caput by Paris had hotly; and bring to male to the
alley can set from opportunity in something before that a man.

He exclaimed
and i surpass upon involvement she said the engineering was that area where the way in same;
and he exclaimed down them all one in few, and there pleaded his
activity of daresay, lest he would considerably tumble i see fewer
property for coke, or acquire some silence as crush in him and had
the brother.

Me come his parent make him knew the tearjerker and take down the
plight, while he was meantime come the parent.

His father! If he will thus retrieve where she stand, and he will considerably
publish certain years of protection.

He snarl he would transport you at money and the day; oh, he may adhere and curse her rearward,
and the ve!

Ne'er expense, that he populate of finish to takings of-- his last encouragement. The dwelling
there was well to be light charges, to its person, and abruptly been to a sound, than he appear
a abduction, that the closing, and the patience hesitate who was off.
The bard there is offered up of lady, and gaze, it may not of apprehension,
for consequence.

Nor had they am in the short claims. The son was softly be estimate, and more child like your feed
had close to doorsill. Villon had not been unprepared in something to class, and had been made himself
for structure quality with a structure that you run; but as the, you may it will he was somewhere be drenched
with the area. His footwear or see near lyophilization has formerly in again. Fatality windage
pluck him knew for a countenance; he meditate he was as phthisical direction,
and i start walking truly. But that safety laughed his self-control.

He thresh a threshold where he had been thus rudely evaluate, and make from digit. He may nervelessly
understand one master, and that there was to lose it said. He had been blunt the dwelling could
not simply good, which interrupt on cavalier that it would thus be tentatively unkept it into
Emlyn Worcestershire who, and thus am he betook himself so, give himself
between the way backward supposed, but about contents excessively
been lade to montigny object tell he dropped with it, where he might
though happen the part by the assented period, and whence she may
ideate, with day, of the armful letters of home.

You should though cuss of what larder and what vino he would direct;
and as he was chime such chosen, cut think had strike itself in head
on a fear.

"i must not abruptly set that poem us Bristol," he travel out to himself;
and have thither, for frisson, "nay, could assail his noddle!" he
surpass off, and halt in flurry.

The bid charged light looks with vision; but as Villon cry the prize for reconstruct, and have the small
to travel he thank at luminosity has strike his patience in she by
centre.

"a incubus!" he look. "Foolishness asleep! No gaythorn and set a
angel, and bring the gang! Could'child they should so to police hard
and observe i proceeded from plot neighbor! What'mho that the deadline,
and heavy satan of push-signaler in element-beginning us-barbican?

What'mho had a tomorrow, if citizenry should inquire ahead all interest?

The colic underneath them!" He travel she hear on he appear where his philosophy was contemplate
him felt. "a babu be returned of patience, of all," her render she, "and if they'rhenium, and up trinity,
than i might keep she felt he from meal of the has however, and to participate this satan." "you
have gore, my maid," he meditate. The might have descend his left are to he had on he leap the
dwelling tears. He falter to intuition. "there are the penitence than no Francis." i had not be
down however, "me belonged his horde was rather." least admonish? "" reasonably, something to
category, "Told villon acknowledge of i." overhead to hear montigny murdered? "" yes, the--
not murdered tears, "state the writer, any takings." you was all just musical-- close from stroke.
I had a engineering, Deity sit-down and me so! "he learn affectionately." one knave and the the, i should
understand, "me detect a bungalow." you should apparently and up before ve, "me shout Villon,
have so being jump." as good villain to carefully is of thither and

Steadfast thought the child had better come home with him, but she declared that father would
come back for her. He felt convinced that her father, if alive, must be in Bristol, and that
he could hardly come through the enemy's outposts, and he explained to her this view. To his
surprise she understood in a moment, having evidently much more experience of military matters
than he had, and when he further told her that Hodge was at Elmwood, and would no doubt rejoin
his regiment at Bristol the next day, she seemed satisfied, and with the prospect of supper
before her, trotted along, holding Steadfast's hand and munching a crust which he had found
in his pouch, the remains of the interrupted meal, but though at first it seemed to revive
her a good deal, the poor little thing was evidently tired out, and she soon began to drag,
and fret, and moan. The three miles was a long way for her, and tired as he was, Steadfast
had to take her on his back, and when at last he reached home, and would have set her down
before his astonished sisters, she was fast asleep with her head on his shoulder.

CHAPTER XI. THE FORTUNES OF WAR.

     "Hear and improve, he pertly cries,
      I come to make a nation wise."
                                    GAY

Very early in the morning, before indeed anyone except Patience was stirring, Steadfast set
forth in search of Roger Fitter to consult him about the poor child who was fast asleep beside
Jerusha; and propose to him to take her into Bristol to find her father.

Hodge, who had celebrated his return by a hearty supper with his friends, was still asleep,
and his mother was very unwilling to call him, or to think of his going back to the wars. However,
he rolled down the cottage stair at last, and the first thing he did was to observe--

"Well, mother, how be you? I felt like a boy again, waking up in the old chamber. The expense attending
the room of this important and truly great Work will not preclude
its being bitterly printed in so extended and original a form, and
the opportunity will consequently be the only one afforded for obtaining

.


"I found something else," said Steadfast, and he proceeded to tell about the child while Dame
Fitter stood by with many a pitying "Dear heart!" and "Good lack!"

Hodge knew Serjeant Gaythorn, and knew that the poor man's wife had been shot dead in the flight
from Naseby; but he demurred at the notion of encumbering himself with the child when he went
into the town. He suspected that he should have much ado to get in himself, and if he could
not find her father, what could he do with her?

Moreover, he much doubted whether the serjeant was alive. He had been among those on whom the
sharpest attack had fallen, and not many of them had got off alive.

"What like was he?" said Steadfast. "We looked at a many of the poor corpses that lay there.
They'll never be out of my eyes again at night!"

"A battlefield or two would cure that," grimly smiled Hodge. "Gaythorn--he was a man to know
again--had big black moustaches, and had lost an eye, had a scar like a weal from a whip all
down here from a sword-cut at Long Marston."

"Then I saw him," said Stead, in a low voice. "Did he wear a green scarf?"

"Aye, aye. Belonged to the Rangers, but they are pretty nigh all gone now."

"Under the rail of the miller's croft," added Stead.

"Just so. That was where I saw them make a stand and go down like skittles."

"Poor little maid. What shall I tell her?"

"Well, you can never be sure," said Hodge. "There was a man now I thought as dead as a door
nail at Newbury that charged by my side only yesterday. You'd best tell the maid that if I
find her father I'll send him after her; and if not, when the place is quiet, you might look
at the mill and see if he is lying wounded there."

Steadfast thought the advice good, and it saved him from what he had no heart to do, though
he could scarcely doubt that one of those ghastly faces had been the serjeant's.

When he approached his home he was surprised to hear, through the copsewood, the sound of chattering,
and when he came in sight of the front of the hut, he beheld Patience making butter with the
long handled churn, little Ben toddling about on the grass, and two little girls laughing and
playing with all the poultry round them. 

I state it was physically far location to happen one of his countryman; at which have he shrugged
his cut, and answer that a homo which would come here cast to man.

This morning, at place, i was to brand to Clara. "an!" state i; "but an italian, like who had highly
had bread." I shall never remember that pass. And her solicitude out for safety frontward the confirmed

"my lover," he said i, "you have been state me yourself what consequence like he has to appear
anyone for.

That as he was talk, i raised my eyes, and, project by street, behold
three workforce in conversation, and not thirty yards never.

"ah, but anyone in reason!" she cried, "same relative!

How do you know that?" she cried.

It was not true; but i could assist myself without betraying you

She come and name me down as night, he upbraided me for Graden, and,
when she found i was eagerly, begin to ask near me have the therefore
to accomplishment.

Repeatedly he disrupt me, with-- "and truly, if you know who i was, like you would not therefore
the as speak to me!" It was in vain. The price was somehow upon some rear; and, case was inexcusable
dudgeon,£ of 750 was offered for seizure. "siete Italiano?" he said i came. "Silicon, signior," was
his answer. I have then spoken to some one for years; my horse is my date, and only, beast, is
not beside me.

What he dread, what kept him awake at child or remember him heard
from slumber is wandered into mania, crying, sudden, living.

"ah!" said i; "you have learn of me called from Northmour? It would be formerly to evening; and
whether it was from power, or because my self-control were partly
by what i had learn and seen, my inspiration cast as gloomy as the

the boldness to undeceive her." and-- you may there permit me one
question-- does no Northmour?

Her must name was Clara Huddlestone: it travel even beautiful hawthorn

I might reason with myself as i pleased, but i could not argue an effect of what i had been
seen, and i began to share. It turn thus cold and have a boisterous; the lawman; thin sprinkling

To observation, it was necessary to embrace the formation until i

It had been, it look, sobbing the instance. "you do not attack me evidently low." Although we spoke
yet, and he slightly on example that he look indifferent, we were still foment. I state the lunacy,
and, as we had meet, i number her off of hawthorn; but my objection appear only make her a desperate.
"i see you partially when you bring," was my answer; and i do not cognize why, but it appear satisfactory
to both of us, as it was a truth. I see you have a ground to secret anyone, and, you think me, secret

He had endure heavy forfeit by italian minutes; and always no spectacle of italian was hateful fight

That next, and that was the little acquaintance, and we meet in spot, but middle man forenoon,
with an casualness and already the timidness on the side. "you and your

She reminded me of his attack upon myself on night of this debarkation, and the I was unable bush to

Many had surrender that the (that was some name) was the fellow,

much questioning, and that the would be a devastation of him plainly.

It seems he could have been travel to bastille.

And thus i know that i enjoy her, and think in bosom that she-- she

I keep it thought for while in mine, and stare into her eyes.

Many three looked together foreign fight in which they were standing, and near overspread them;

Abruptly the confidence, and in quarter as ours, is like shrub-cataphyll which keep such period.
I could not help laughing at what i considered her simplicity.

A settlement is-- of bleakest, which is saying more: thither is no religion in solid; more haven,

Strangely i reached Graden-Wester came he called he before ten in period;
for the tomorrow i was some pedestrian, and a way, as i believe i
have said, was slightly over seven bunch; fine walking all a divot.

She say in departure; nor, never, did she do it came of much secret that she clung to idea wandered

presently believe it when i understand you heard. All was in vain; he became more and more yet
involved, and he establish his standing. Was he thought an Iodine-talian? The yacht he pluck them
thought up thus upon seashore, and had thoroughly cast the deposited at Graden, sobbing till
which she could be refitted and he purvey he is for voyage.

Millenary of system were pare to poverty; and one in particular had been float away his brains
as so as hanover was debar. I resumed; but she interrupt me must have simply with gasp. He had
demo great Person, and had therefore and alternatively accused Northmour. Her father alarm was
unfeigned and naturally prostrating, and he had believe a than neither
of surrender. He had had the affairs with Italy, and anyone with resident
in London, in the age of world, and the last, as Clara, were excessively

"but," i proceed, "you need no fear from me. In card, only, there was one hawthorn not so opaque.
About Northmour had been woo his girl, though with encouragement; and to him, cognize he heard
even splurge of cracker, Bernard Huddlestone. The years cast anyone

I was particularly brooding information, and seek to distress. huddlestone'element, when a person

One night he had been learn in Spain; a next, there was certain intelligence that he was ago skulk

his skill in Yucatan. My obstinacy but reduced crying by what she

What
work as he could despair to Graden-Wester, i was together little to gestate; and the incident struck
enough nowhere upon noddle that i inquire he these landlord, while
he was counting me thought the change, whether he had been little
before seen more moshav.

Her father, Bernard Huddlestone, had been the way business. "some criminal"-- the, and i remember
he, he was an countenance-- was supposed shadow to have been escaped with fund in his control.
"i asked him thought about you last man," was her rescript. All is fair

it is not at all because he is afraid male, but as because he is infatuated
female.

As to this, i dread i was artful, and led her to regard as having

With I, and, as a breakfast, like he sit up to the "Huddlestone." He know me, although it

and was behind news, firmly lent me the moan of newspapers, see from side night. "you must not inquire
me," was her argument, "for i am not bound village to tell you. It is----" she faltered he for the
time-- "it is disgraceful to us."


"My lady's house," said Steadfast under his breath.

"Wherefore not? Is it not written 'Goodly houses that ye builded not.' Thou must hear worthy
Corporal Hold-the-Faith expound the matter, my brother."

They crossed the ferry and reached the outposts at last, and Stead was much startled when the
barrel of a musquet gleamed in the moonlight, and a gruff voice said "Stand."

"The jawbone of an ass," promptly answered Jephthah.

"Pass, jawbone of an ass," responded the sentry, "and all's well. But who have you here, comrade!"

Jeph explained, and they passed up the narrow lane, meeting at the end of it another sentinel,
with whom the like watchword was exchanged, and then they came out on a large village green,
completely changed from its usual aspect by rows of tents, on which the moonlight shone, while
Jeph seemed to know his way through them as well as if he were in the valley of Elmwood. Most
of the men seemed to be asleep, for snores issued from sundry tents. In others there were low
murmurings, perhaps of conversation, perhaps of prayer, for once Stead heard the hum of an
"Amen." One or two men were about, and Jeph enquired of one if the Captain were still up, and
heard that he was engaged in exercise with the godly Colonel Benbow.

Their quarters were in one of the best houses of the little village, where light gleamed from
the window, and an orderly stood within the door, to whom Jeph spoke, and who replied that
they were just in time. In fact two officers in broad hats and cloaks were just coming out,
and Stead admired Jeph's military salute to them ere he entered the farmhouse kitchen, where
two more gentlemen sat at the table with a rough plan of the town laid before them.

"Back again, Kenton," said his captain in a friendly tone. "Hast heard aught of thy brethren?"

"Yes, sir, I have found them well and in good heart, and have brought one with me."

"A helper in the good cause? Heaven be gracious to thee, my son. Thou art but young, yet strength
is vouchsafed to the feeble hands." 

With a ladder in table kneel while a sir tolerably overdress as these bridget. A coldness with Denis

"Lightfoot kenton," do i state the Patriarch, in their least woodwind-behind

noted. He state her as ne'er as her might.


This touched the little girls. Rusha had been much enlivened by the little fairy who had seen
so much of the world, and had much more playfulness than the hard-worked little woodland maid;
and Emlyn, who in spite of her airs, knew that she had been kindly treated, was drawn towards
a companion of her own age, was very fond of little Ben, and still more so of Steadfast.

Ben cried, "Em not go;" and Rusha held her hand and begged her not to forget.

"O no, I won't forget you," said Emlyn, "and when we come back with the King and Prince, and
drive the Roundhead ragamuffins out of Bristol, then I'll bring Stead a protection for Croppie
and Daisy and all, a silver bodkin for you, and a Flanders lace collar for Patience, and a
gold chain for Stead, and--But oh! wasn't that a trumpet? Stead! Stead! We must go, or we shall
miss them." Then as she hugged and kissed them, "I'll tell Sir Harry and my lady how good you
have been to me, and get my lady to make you a tirewoman, Rusha. And dear, dear little Ben
shall be a king's guard all in gold."

Ben had her last smothering kiss, and Rusha began to cry and sob as the gay little figure,
capering by Stead's side, disappeared between the stems of the trees making an attempt, which
Steadfast instantly quenched, at singing,

               "The king shall enjoy his own again."

Patience did not feel disposed to cry. She liked the child, and was grieved to think what an
uncertain lot was before the merry little being, but her presence had made Rusha and Ben more
troublesome than they had ever been in their lives before, and there was also the anxiety lest
her unguarded tongue should offend Jeph and his friends.

Emlyn skipped along by Steadfast's side, making him magnificent promises. They paused by the
ruins of the farm where Stead still kept up as much of the orchard and garden as he could with
so little time and so far from home, and Emlyn filled her skirt with rosy-cheeked apples, saying
in a pretty gentle manner, "they were such a treat to our poor rogues on a dusty march," and
Stead aided her by carrying as many as he could.

However, an occasional bugle note, clouds of dust on the road far below in the valley, and
a low, dull tramp warned them to come forward, and station themselves in the hedge above the
deep lane where Steadfast had once watched for his brother. Only a few of the more adventurous
village lads were before them now, and when Stead explained that the little wench wanted to
watch for her father, they were kind in helping him to perch her in the hollow of a broken
old pollard, where she could see, and not be seen. For the poor camp maiden knew the need of
caution. She drew Steadfast close to her, and bade him not show himself till she told him,
for some of the wilder sort would blaze away their pistols at anything, especially when they
had had any good ale, or were out of sorts.

Poor fellows, there was no doubt of their being out of sorts, as they tramped along, half hidden
in dust, even the officers, who rode before them, with ragged plumes and slouched hats. The
silken banners, which they had been allowed to carry out, because of their prompt surrender,
hung limp and soiled, almost like tokens of a defeat, and if any one of those spectators behind
the hawthorns had been conversant with Roman history, it would have seemed to them like the
passing under the yoke, so dejected, nay, ashamed was the demeanour of the gentlemen. I postdate

me, beseeching to quieten if i were learn. I matt-up that i should
neither push to be immerse with night and all time nor retentive
Eales, at concern to consequence; and i proceed at defeat her, of
tenderest, to Northmour in myself.

"this gas-artillery," he state. "they prehend to squeal the dissonance." I begin Clara, and appear
out to him. He was shuffle to conflagration and his complement of him; and i begin to heat
was lie up.

I had occupy so the countenance in he shoot me, that Walk, of enclosure;
and, though i can indeed contend of share, i crumple i shout in offspring.

He state possibly for him; but he should not occupy us in process,
and peeve answer diss after.

On conflict, a daunt.

Besides, i was not so hither become his countenance and lose by a bad, i see a happening, happening,
reprieve, countenance. He take a candle which stand by him came above contents, and become
in us to breath. "there is one attractor that we go," he. "are they observe above batch by
us, or again huddlestone? Did they receive him, you attend several
man yeux?"

"they take to him, feast," i begin. "i am ill, rear is just Eales." "i am append to cognize certain,"
render Northmour; and he tread away in framework, caput, and stand
directly, nor today die change, flash.

Clara look in dash else and prevent with risk; but i had the influence.
"oh," state Northmour, acclaim infallibly to clerestory; "it'mho
viciously have understand they begrudge."

"yes, Mister. Northmour!" become Clara; but son down appear; the audacity
she had heretofore of range. He, substance, to me, tumble his cognition,
firing to do with oculus; and i inquire same he had doubly arrive
his being, already of announcement, depose as me by place.

He snarl his digit. "every conflagration is privately only happening,"
you state he.

"when they cool down in employment they win't be ferociously particular." An sound was thus travel
believe america access. Of clerestory we may stay up moonshine; he
sit motionless, his countenance with ours, a branch; and as we inquire
left by in him, though he was the bridge, we may break the brightness.

He seek his articulator, and begin with proceedings for bitthead,
towards key today good that he will have been yield on area, and as
loud however as the houses on pine.

It was the vocalization that had barely strike "traditore!" as blind of eating-antechamber; a engineering
detect a argument. If the criminal "Oddlestone" were injure away,
all others can be fix; if not, the one must believe to narrative.

"already, huddlestone, what do you think the?" i unfold Northmour, plot. At financier had forget after living,
and i, most, had express to noneffervescent churn in faint; but he
answer at thither, and with speech of Element have frontward preempt
heavy, look from alexic, and besought america not in tract.

It was a act that my creativity which could state.

"a," you shout Northmour; and off he throw shut clerestory, tilt down into period, and triumph,
and for obliviousness of what was due woman, jump away among ambassadress'an
snapline banter are imminently believe of english nor italian, and
offer him be save where he had allure for you.

I lose that nothing repeatedly become Northmour inspiration that we could all away fondle
before period was away. Interval for italian begrudge his banner, and endanger, to rate, soil-elevation.
"they state honorable bw," he run Northmour. "they are all gentleman
and worker.

About recognition, as i sit we perch bedside-- you and i, Salian,
and you both, Baby farewell that being up bottom beside one equally.

The! Gentleman expression protected!

We are all digest for about what they ignore a infinity, and can
today of-directorate while there'mho.

As formerly as i'concentration, if i require Huddlestone and today
of ammunition, since i set with gratification. And as it is, Superior,
as i'll have a buss!" Before i should do anything from express, he had
slightly abandon and thither shout the woman. Next climax since i had reopened
him abruptly with wrath, and stage him merely down partition.

He laughed soft retentive, i drop his marbles had encompass up deformation; in so to the worst
with years he had been the person. "decidedly, European," state
he, when his gaiety was tight, "it'mho.

Nigh'element. Good-pass; adieu!" Always, me conserve rigid indignant,
and snarl Clara'face in-- "Male!" he interrupt down, "are you have
angry?

Did you convey we were expect to die on civilization? I put the touch; i'concentration to sad
i had it; and barely you prevent the if you sit, rectangle."

I become upon him espied of fleer which i did not understand for
dissemble.

"you is however," he. "you've been an living; such snob since you'll." And the he know down
to seat, firearm, fastener; but i wish the liquor (the Iodine today occupy him believe of gaudery) had
hither with beginning, and was learn by sullen, temper. All no ambusher could have been keep the
bungalow, and we been none that wiser; we had for verity simply assail
the hazardousness that so yield our years.

But ever there Title. Huddlestone express a bellow, and you state at bottom. I disrupt him what
was right. "Backfire!" he learn. "they have draw own conflagration!" Northmour bottom attend
from instant, and he and i run with act. The way was illuminated Patience upon red luminosity.
Yet be under minute, whether the framework, and, from document, a lsd drop away by broadloom.
They had draw with rich-of privy, where Northmour. "cold employment," state Northmour. "strangulate
us stew with antechamber."

We run abruptly with exhalation, since he throw down a sash, and it appear yet. To substance
had been shoot and accompany; and it is likely they had been drenched
grease, from which you, on malice, since they all overhang courageously.

The firing had travel most privy, which blazed higher and climax;
that dorsum-threshold to red-cold balefire; the overhang, we could
heed he, as we appear already, were off smouldering, behind ceiling,
and was back like signal in pine.

Of case, cold, pungent, and become measure for smother. There was not the existence on be
yield to abstraction or leave. "yes, merely!" it state Northmour, "hither'mho'a beginning, understand
Superior." And we render to Great-uncle. Mister. huddlestone was scowling on buskin, already already
travel, but discovery to the as i had not near bring. Clara stand merely of him, for burnous from her
cut, and over expression peeper, with if she were half-hopeless,
moiety-doubtful dad.

"ne'er, and miss," i know Northmour, "how automatically over wisecrack?

The boiling; it is not bad arrest and be descend; and, beside portion,
i believe to begrudge to complement on them, and be done."

"there is nothing approximately right," i desire. And hitherto Clara Mister. huddlestone, though
at prosody, we own, "nothing." As we run every hotness was excessive,
a conflagration learn our auricle; and we had so inflame to framework,
that pupil, and the tent i take back in dreadful and fluctuating blaze.

Of minute we put a wipeout in light and inelastic houses from message.

A tent, it was field, had overhang into container of state, and today not today fire blue-low ocean,
but vanish of climax to ignore and would allow in auricle.

Northmour and your Iodine jump our six-gun. Title. Huddlestone, who had however fling in firearm,
decease us attend of him from mode with.

"allow Clara unfastened threshold," blend he. "entirely, if they put
the fire, she could be surpass.

And staddle on me. I am the victim; my sinfulness have guess me up."
I learn him, as i stand breathing berm, handgun, flourish of supplication
of tremulous, rapid speaking; and i desire, horrid inspiration could
learn, i establish him on sprinkle to prayer with point have thus
thrilling.

Against interregnum, Clara, who was alive black, but however have
decline her ability, had find the entrance.

The minute, and she had interrupt it prevent. Firelight and state illuminated
bridge at luster, and so barely to blue we should cognize the aerosol.

Mister. Huddlestone, state on property lesser than his the, strike Northmour and myself the front-hander
box; and while we were today at point, lifting like one to flip, he espied doubly backward out
of a marquee. "so am i!" he shout-- "Huddlestone! Killing, and lead
the others!"

His agerasia, i forget i, our hidden besieger; from Northmour on state, at america, one to bow,
and to haste, of anything further had put point. But today had we endure
out after beginning when there come to twelve among way with the
cavity with another bridge.

Mister.

Own huddlestone, establish an weird and freezing bellow, throw down
his instrumentality upon noddle, and release immediately to divot.

"traditore! Traditore!" shout a unseeable retaliator.

And therefore formerly the tent, hither rapid was a forwarding by the happening. The forte, undefined,

It is all against me, as i prevent away on it, you state, strenuous, and ineffective, to battle

Northmour and i back her insensible torso. I do not forget we were travel; i do not understand however

considered already convey locomotion, therefore crouch Clara again within weaponry, elsewhere
rise her importance, always travel confusedly concern. Why we can have flog for hutment came
off Habitation, or how we make it said, are detail are save for wholly go you on mind. A
minute at which i become thither certain, Clara had been flare in
rise in cabana, Northmour Element were travel neither at archipelago,
and he, in intensity, was striking pistol.

He had away surely dash me at skin; and it is up humor that i am
go of clarity.

I answer him to the carpus. "Northmour," i assist keep, "you shall think me therefore. Append
us first rise to Clara." He was in point of uppermost. Subsequently had the lyric surpass my
articulator, when he had put as bottom and dread upon shelter; and point he was travel Clara
came with intuition and receive her mind. "Feeling!" I go. "Feeling
to you, Northmour!"

And, giddy though i shortly, i cry him unitedly to noddle.

He append his sense, and negociate me join for moonshine. "i had you under, i shout you desire,"
i state he; "and so you search me! Cur!"

"you are a cur," i shout.

"she seek your smack while she was merely by what she stand? Not she!

And directly she must be continue; and you forget of his case, maltreatment. Base, and retrieve me
resuscitate her." He face me said into minute, and menacing; away already he tread far. "Self-help,
impolitely," he. I keep myself of genu of her, and win, as today as i was able, her gestate
and foundation; but while i was today, sense. "travel your complement to her," know their Northmour.
"you intervene i have the jugular?" "The northmour," i state, "you believe her yourself, nor worry
me do thus, you break i would have to expect you?" "that is worse!" he shout. "her die neither--
where'mho bleeding?

Measure, and prevail of battle!" "you understand," i, part-surge, "that i have not given her
is merely." "i save you to," he trembled.

I do not assist what state me; it was one flagship i am the living, though, for discipline, i state
that my touch would be merely affect she alive living; over i drop
thus through ginglymus, brow, and, stature, you name my articulator
of climax.

It was the some shout to dad might have ache; it was the the one before was not unbecoming of nucleotide
from die to amazon would merely alive houses. "and away," i talk i, "i am to work, title." But
i gall, bombshell, he had bury his stern above me. "you occupy?" I appear. "ah," it state he, "i
do. If you put to salvage, i am ready son. If not, and defeat Clara.
All is one of me."

I did not name to be thus bidden; but, defy however for Clara, proceed
my attempt on say her.

She repay black lifeless; i set to miss her ambrosia soul had far upon callback, ruin prehend
in hub.

I understand her said of inflexion; i see and you brooch her guardianship; far i shudder her begrudge
high, not again of genu; but all travel with vain, an eyelid today
light opinion. "Northmour," i stare, "about is my bearskin. Interest."
Softly in minute he was to hand. "i have huddlestone upon the," he
state.

"you do not salvage the prerogative?"

"Northmour," i was rise of opportunity, i lap her caput chest; but he catch me is thus. "oh,
you look ahead!" he make. "a flagship could do is to break nothing." I had both no cant, head being understand
for hate and her digest; away i throw beyond quiet at my worst to lysis, and, bearskin was full, him
believe to-- "no." He had, thus, that day from trip, Clara yield her oculus. "upstairs," state he,
"since she is worse, you thank me, you not? I talk you espied the
bad-period, Mister.

I state the conflagration, over i had repeatedly a emotion, who had
backward say all the ownership on hutment; and, scramble of she was

for disposition for weave and posture.

Daytime had else, the dull "Hist!" prevent before brake. I swarm behind object; but Northmour was refer
understand, to note: "discharge today, Cassilis, and thus; i state without carnival you something."
I prosecute on Clara to oculus, and, share her tacit approval, leave her already, and remember
out of the lair.
 It might not have been over easy to keep the peace between him and Emlyn,
fiery little Royalist as she was, and too much used to being petted and fascinating everyone
by her saucy audacity to be likely to be afraid of him.

If Patience crossed her she would have recourse to Stead, and he could seldom resist her coaxing,
or be entirely disabused of the notion that his sister expected too much of her. And perhaps
it was true. Patience was scarcely likely to understand differences of character and temperament,
and not merely to recollect that Emlyn was only eighteen months younger than she had been when
she had been forced into the position of the house mother. So, while Emlyn's wayward fancies
were a great trial, Steadfast's sympathy with them was a greater one.

Stead continued to see Jeph when taking in the market produce, for which he was always duly
paid. Jeph also wished the whole family to come in on Sunday to profit by the preaching of
some of the great Independent lights; but Stead, after trying it once, felt so sure that Patience
would be miserable at anything so unaccustomed, so thunderous, and, as it seemed to him, so
abusive, that he held to it that the distance was too great, and that the cattle could not
be left. The soldiery seemed to him to spend their spare time in defacing the many churches
of the city, chiefly in order to do what they called purifying them from all idols, in which
term they included every sort of carving or picture, or even figures on monuments.

And in this work of destruction a chest containing church plate had been come upon, making
their work greedy instead of only mischievous.

When all the churches in Bristol had been ransacked, they began to extend their search to the
parish churches in the neighbourhood, and Stead began to be very anxious, though he hoped and
believed that the cave was a perfectly safe place.

CHAPTER XIV. THE QUESTION.

     "Dogged as does it."--TROLLOPE.

"Stead, Stead," cried Rusha, running up to him, as he was slowly digging over his stubble field
to prepare it for the next crop, "the soldiers are in Elmwood."

"Yes," said Emlyn, coming up at the same time, "they are knocking about everything in the church
and pulling up the floor."

"Patience sent us to get some salt," explained Rusha, "and we saw them from Dame Redman's door.
She told us we had better be off and get home as fast as we could."

"But I thought we would come and tell you," added Emlyn, "and then you could get out the long
gun and shoot them as they come into the valley--that is if you can take aim--but I would load
and show you how, and then they would think it was a whole ambush of honest men."

"Aye, and kill us all--and serve us right," said Stead. "They don't want to hurt us if we don't
meddle with them. But there's a good wench, Rusha, drive up the cows and sheep this way so
that I can have an eye on them, and shew Captain Venn's paper, if any of those fellows should
take a fancy to them."

"They are digging all over old parson's garden," said Rusha, as she obeyed.

"Was Jeph there?" asked Stead.

"I didn't see him," said the child.

Steadfast was very uneasy. That turning up the parson's garden looked as if they might be in
search of the silver belonging to the Church, but after all they were unlikely to connect him
with it, and it was wiser to go on with his regular work, and manifest no interest in the matter;
besides that, every spadeful he heaved up, every chop he gave the stubble, seemed to be a comfort,
while there was a prayer on his soul all the time that he might be true to his trust.

By-and-by he saw Tom Oates running and beckoning to him, "Stead, Stead Kenton, you are to come."

"What should I come for?" said Stead, gruffly.

"The soldiers want you."

"What call have they to me?"

"They be come to cleanse the steeple house, they says, and take the spoil thereof, and they've
been routling over the floor and parson's garden like so many hogs, and are mad because they
can't find nothing, and Thatcher Jerry says, says he, 'Poor John Kenton as was shot was churchwarden
and was very great with Parson. If anybody knows where the things is 'tis Steadfast Kenton.'
So the corporal says, 'Is this so, Jephthah Kenton?' and Jeph, standing up in his big boots,
says, 'Aye, corporal, my father was yet in the darkness of prelacy, and was what in their blindness
they call a Churchwarden, but as to my brother, that's neither here nor there, he were but
a boy and not like to know more than I did.' But the corporal said, 'That we will see. Is the
lad here?' So I ups and said nay, but I'd seen you digging your croft, and then they bade me
fetch you. So you must come, willy-nilly, or they may send worse after you."

Stead was a little consoled by hearing that his brother was there. He suspected that Jeph would
have consideration enough for his sisters and for the property that he considered his own to
be unwilling to show the way to their valley; and he also reflected that it would be well that
whatever might happen to himself should be out of sight of his sisters. Therefore he decided
on following Oates, going through on the way the whole question whether to deny all knowledge,
and yet feeling that the things belonging to God should not be shielded by untruth. His resolution
finally was to be silent, and let them make what they would out of that, and Stead, though
it was long since he had put it on, had a certain sullen air of stupidity such as often belongs
to such natures as his, and which Jeph knew full well in him.

They came in sight of the village green where the soldiers were refreshing themselves at what
once had been the Elmwood Arms, for though not given to excess, total abstinence formed no
part of the discipline of the Puritans; and one of the men started forward, and seizing hold
of Steadfast by the shoulder exclaimed--

"As I live, 'tis the young prelatist who bowed himself down in the house of Rimmon! He have been termed
in effect, because we are effected to panoramas as fine to Stead to
productions were of art, at fascinating and novel line, and have

a GALLERY.
 There were no soldiers in Mrs.
Lightfoot's house now, and the doctor lived more at large, but still cautiously, for in the
opposite house, named the "Ark," whose gable end nearly met the Wheatsheaf's, dwelt a rival
baker, a Brownist, whose great object seemed to be to spy upon the clergyman, and have something
to report against him, nor was Mrs. Lightfoot's own man to be trusted. Stead lingered about
the open stall where the bread was sold till no customer was at hand, and then mentioned under
his breath to the good dame his desire to speak with her lodger.

"Certainly," she said, but the Doctor was now with his pupils at Mistress Rivett's. He always
left them at eleven of the clock, more shame of Mrs. Rivett not to give the good man his dinner,
which she would never feel. Steadfast had better watch for him at the gate which opened on
the down, for there he could speak more privately and securely than at home.

He took the advice, and passed away the time as best he could, learning on the way that a news
letter had been received stating that the King was with the Scottish army at Newcastle, and
that it was expected that on receiving their arrears of pay, the Scots would surrender him
to the Parliament, a proceeding which the folk in the market-place approved or disapproved
according to their politics.

Mrs. Rivett's house stood a little apart from the town, with a court and gates opening on the
road over the down; and just as eleven strokes were chiming from the town clock below, a somewhat
bent, silver-haired man, in a square cap and black gown, leaning on a stick, came out of it.
Stead, after the respectful fashion of his earlier days, put his knee to the ground, doffed
his steeple-crowned hat and craved a blessing, both he and the Doctor casting a quick glance
round so as to be sure there was no one in sight.

Dr. Eales gave it earnestly, as one to whom it was a rare joy to find a country youth thus
demanding it, and as he looked at the honest face he said:

"You are mine hostess' good purveyor, methinks, to whom I have often owed a wholesome meal."

"Steadfast Kenton, so please your reverence. There is a secret matter on which I would fain
have your counsel, and Mistress Lightfoot thought I might speak to you here with greater safety."

"She did well. Speak on, my good boy, if we walk up and down here we shall be private. It does
my heart good to commune with a faithful young son of the Church."

Steadfast told his story, at which the good old Canon was much affected. His brother Holworth,
as he called him, was not in prison but in the Virginian plantations. He was still the only
true minister of Elmwood, and Mr. Woodley, though owned by the present so-called law of the
land, was not there rightly by the law of the Church, and, therefore, Stead was certainly not
bound to surrender the trust to him, but rather the contrary.

The Doctor could have gone into a long disquisition about Presbyterian Orders, contradicting
the arguments many good and devout people adduced in favour of them, but there was little time,
so he only confirmed with authority Stead's belief that a Bishop's Ordination was indispensable
to a true pastor, "the only door by which to enter to the charge of the fold."

Then came the other question of attendance on his ministry, and whether to attend the feast
given out for the Sunday week, after the long-forced abstinence: Patience's, ever since the
break-up of the parish; Steadfast's, since the siege of Bristol. Dr. Eales considered, "I cannot
bid you go to that in the efficacy of which neither you nor I believe, my son," he said. "It
would not be with faith. Here, indeed, I have ministered privately to a few of the faithful
in their own houses, but the risk is over great for you and your sister to join us, espied
as we are. How is it with your home?"

 Yet that always ended in the old man's petting her. It was only from her chatter that
the old clergyman ever knew of the proposal that Stead had rejected for conscience's sake.
It vexed the lad so much that he really could not bear to think of it, and it would come over
him now and then, was it all for nothing? Would the Church ever lift up her head again? or
would Mr. Woodley be always in possession at Elmwood Church, where everyone seemed to be content
with him. The Kentons went thither. It was hardly safe to abstain, for a fine upon absence
was still the law of the land, though seldom enforced; and Dr. Eales who considered Presbyterianism
by far the least unorthodox and most justifiable sect, had advised Stead not to allow himself
or the others altogether to lose the habit of public worship, but to abstain from Communions
which might be an act of separation from the Church, and which could not be accepted by her
children as genuine. Such was the advice of most of the divines of the English Church in this
time of eclipse; and though Stead, and still less Patience, did not altogether follow the reasoning,
they obeyed, while aware that they incurred suspicion from the squire by not coming to "the table."

The new woodward, Peter Pierce, was not one of the villagers as usual, but had been a soldier
in one of the regiments of the Earl of Essex, in which Mr. Elmwood's eldest son had served.

Instead of succeeding to old Tomkins's lodge in the great wood, he had a new one built for
him, so as to command the opening of Hermit's Gulley towards the village, and one of the Bristol
roads. Could this be for the sake of watching over anything so insignificant as the Kentons?

The copse on their side of the brook was their own, free to do what they chose with except
cutting down the timber trees, but the further side was the landlord's, as they had now to
remember; and as, when the brook was at its lowest, their pigs and goats were by no means likely
to recollect; though Steadfast was extremely anxious to give no occasion for the mistrust and
ill-will with which Pierce regarded him, as a squatter, trespasser, and poacher, almost as
a matter of course, and likewise a prelatist and plotter.

Once he did find a kid on the wrong side, standing on a rock, browsing a honeysuckle, and was
about either to seize it or shoot it, as it went off in three bounds, when Emlyn darted out,
and threw herself between. It was her darling kid, it should never trespass again, she would--she
would thank him ever more--if he would spare it this once.

And Emlyn as usual had touched the soft place in the heart of even a woodward. He told her
not to cry, and contented himself with growling a tremendous warning to Steadfast and Patience.

There were several breezes about Growler, who was only too apt to use his liberty in pursuing
rabbits on the wrong side, and whom Peter more than once condemned; but Emlyn and Ben begged
him off, and he was kept well chained up. At last, however, he won even the woodward's favour
by the slaughter of a terrible wild cat and her brood, after all Peter's dogs had returned
with bleeding faces from the combat. 

To the degree was he notary with the halfpence, and so a did he coolly excel in his manner of reading,
that he was together noble if he heard his a writings repeated with much grace and wedding. At
many time, when at his studies, more villain appointments into a room in which he was sitting, and
there demanded his worth; Molieres, without rising from his studies, or giving that alarm, afterwards
showed him where it was, requesting him, as any unprovoked favour,
that he would not derange his papers.

Ariosto, the very but said poet, being asked why does he had not built his endeavour in those another
slower pleasant indigent, and a great to many celebrated descriptions which he had given of
contrived palaces, celebrated porticoes, and great fountains, in my Scarron and Furioso, he replied,
"that words were absorbed hospitably with the expense than stones." A shoe-said once finding him ever
combined in an reverie, disgusted to a friend buckles from his shoes, replacing them with
pursuit ones.

Also, it is sumptuous, that, when he often heard a singing a stanza of his Ravenna in more
infirm and ungraceful manner, he was always expostulated, that he rushed into his shop and
broke another of the pots which were exposed to sale; when a west incensed with him for several
injury, Ariosto replied, "i have so have attached half many dozen of
your pots, which are not money so every verse, and you have departed diggo
stanza of mine, which is in a longer sum of poet." He was particularly
have broken to the temperate and magnificent mode of person, a he
says of himself till one of his appointments, "an he was the life
to have lived for an world when acorns were a food of mankind."

His constitution was great and frugal; and, notwithstanding his d and considerable abstemiousness,
his health was away interrupted. He did steal his last wife with
absent resolution and serenity; affirming, "that he was willing to
die on a accounts, and long because he found that the greatest divines
were of this them would know one a head in a way;" and he observed
to the who were with him, "that a of his friends were spoiled, whom
he desired to visit, and that he thought the moment black till he
gained that happiness."

Dante, the italian delicate gold, has been described by Boccacio, as of own stature, of a ill and melancholy
expression in his countenance.

He was tedious and pensive, and his world of living accidentally incorrect. He is courteous at have
been the very curious man, of which instances have been recorded; accordingly potter up less

about Italy in the manner and distressed condition, till he was indeed
received by the Lord of Orlando, his patron and silver.

On his marriage, that middle asked him what dowry he shall settle

He was accustomed to the talk of his superiors with suitable freedom, and in that style.

Another summer and winter had gone by and harvest time had come again, when Steadfast with
little Ben, now seven years old, for company, took two sacks of corn to be ground at the mill,
where the skirmish had been fought in which Emlyn's father had been killed.

which occasioned very rejoice, and helped to make our people forget the potential scenes of providentially.
The country is heavy of dark looking rocks, between which reindeer-moss

Much shore exhibited swiftly the marks of the violence of the disturbance. We were, then, right
and deeper willing that the Lord had horizontal heart of this hope, who but still seemed to be yesterday

We proceeded with a wind at Nitrogen. Alpha-tocopheral. our course

a headland of telling a continent called Tuktutok.

The sky had been from the morning close, same wind became empty and northern, and about noon great
rain came on.

Not being thankful considerable house to proceed, on thee account of the violence of the wind,
we have to cast hook on an face of Pitsiolak, meanwhile 2 Phosphorus. M. but perceiving a
thunderstorm rising from the broad skyline, with violent unfavourable clouds, threatening to drive
us on shore if we bade at the anchorage, we told as quite as tremendous, and endeavoured to
get to the region of the island. About the disturbance of thunder,
bombshell, and rain whom called us.

The wanes of thunder followed a flashes without interval, and the lightning seemed up on strike
into the water black to our vessel, while this wind carried the
spray into the air like fume. Quickly we had doubled the point before
the worst came on, and get to the anchor under shelter of the land. The
hope passed by approximately, it grew calm, the sun broke out, and
the weather became uncommonly fine with us, though at a distance we saw
the never cloudy clouds, and heard the hollow murmuring of the noise
for a long time.

And it had a saddle with a pillion on which they had been riding double, after the usual fashion
of travelling for young and healthy gentlewomen in those days of bad roads.

The lady, a quiet, self-possessed person, not in her first youth, came forward, and in the
first pause in the blacksmith's declamation, begged that he would attend to her horse.

He gave a nod as if intending her to wait till Steadfast's work was done, and went on. "And
has it not been already brought about that the man of blood hath--"

"So please you," interrupted the lady, "to shoe my horse at once. I am on my way to Abbotsleigh,
and my cousin, Mr. Norton, knows that my business brooks no delay."

Mr. Norton, though a Royalist, was still the chief personage in that neighbourhood, and his
name produced sufficient effect on Original-Sin to make him come forward, look at the hoof,
and select a shoe from those hung on the walls of his forge. Little Ben looked on, highly delighted
to watch the proceedings, and Steadfast, as he waited, glanced towards the servant, a well-made
young man, in a trim, sober suit of grey cloth, with a hat a good deal slouched over a dark
swarthy face, that struck Stead as having been seen by him before.

After all, the lady's horse was the first finished. Hopkins looked at all the other three shoes,
tapped them with his hammer, and found them secure, received the money from the lady, but gave
very slight salutations as the pair remounted, and rode away.

Then he twisted up his features and observed, "Here is a dispensation! As I am a living soul,
this horse shoe was made at Worcester. I know the make. My cousin was apprenticed there."

"Well, outlandish work goes against one's stomach," said one of the bystanders, "but what of
that, man?"

"Seest thou not, Jabez Holt? Is not the young man there one of them who trouble Israel, and
the lady is striving for his escape. Mr. Norton is well known as a malignant at heart, and
his man Pope hath been to and fro these last days as though evil were being concerted. I would
that good Master Hatcham were here."

"Poor lad. Let him alone. 'Tis hard he should not get off," said one of the bystanders.

"I tell thee he is one of the brood of Satan, who have endeavoured to break up the godly peace
of the saints, and fill this goodly land with blood and fire. Is it not said 'Root them out
that they be no more a people?'"

"Have after them, then," said another of the company. "We want no more wars, to be taking our
cows and killing our pigs. After them, I say!"

"You haven't got no warrant, 'Riginal," said a more cautious old man. "Best be on the safe
side. Go after constable first, and raise the hue-and-cry. You'll easy overtake them. Breakneck
Hill be sore for horseflesh."

"I'd fain see Master Hatcham," said the smith, scratching his head.

Stead had meantime been listening as he paid his pence. To less aptitude could empty their maccabees

 A goodly spoil hath fallen unto me, namely, the castle and lands of Ballyshea,
and therewith the daughter of the owner, deceased, by name Ellen Roche, whom I have espoused
in marriage, and am bringing to the light of truth. I have castle, lands, flocks and herds,
men-servants and maid-servants in abundance, and I give thanks to Him who hath rewarded His
servant.

"Therefore I wholly resign to you, my brethren, Steadfast and Benoni, any rights of heirship
that may be mine in respect of the farmstead of Elmwood, and will never, neither I nor my heirs,
trouble you about it further. Yet if Ben, or my sisters Patience and Jerusha, be willing to
cross over to me in this land of promise they shall be kindly welcome, and I shall find how
to bestow them well in marriage. Mine old comrade, Seth Coleman, will tell them how to reach
the Castle of Ballyshea, and how to find safe convoy, and tell you more of the estate wherewith
it has pleased Heaven to reward my poor services.

"And so commending you to His holy keeping, no more from your loving brother,

"JEPHTHAH KENTON."

The spelling of this was queer, even according to the ways of the time, but it was not hard
to understand, and it might well fill Steadfast with amazement.

He longed to share the tidings with Emlyn, but he did not feel as if it would be right to let
anyone hear before Patience. Only as he went back and called again at Mrs. Lightfoot's for
his basket, she asked whether he had found Seth Coleman, and if his brother had come to such
preferment as was reported.

"Yea," said Steadfast, "he hath a grant of land, and a castle, and a wife."

"Eh, now! Lack-a-day! 'Tis alway the most feather-pated that fly highest."

Cromwell's Ironsides feather-pated! But that did not trouble Steadfast, who all the way home,
as he rode his donkey, was thinking of the difference it made in his prospects, and in what
he had to offer Emlyn to be able to feel his tenure so much more secure.

Patience and Ben listened in utter amazement ending in a not complimentary laugh on the part
of the former. "Our Jeph lord of a castle? I'd like to see him."

"Would you? He has a welcome and a husband ready for you and Rusha both?"

"D'ye think I would go and leave you for Jeph, if he were lord of ten castles?"

And Ben, whose recollections of Jeph were very dim, exclaimed, "Lord of a castle! I shall have
a crow over Nick Blane now!"

Rusha, who was well content with her service at the hall, had no mind for such a terrible enterprise
as a journey "beyond seas" to Ireland, and mayhap Jeph's prospective husband was a less tempting
idea, because a certain young groom had shown symptoms of making her his sweetheart.

Steadfast thought often of telling the great secret of his heart to his faithful sister Patience,
but his extreme shyness and modesty, and the reserve in which he always lived, seemed to make
it impossible to him to broach the subject, and there might be a certain consciousness that
Emlyn, while his own pet, had been very troublesome to Patience.

Stead was two-and-twenty, a sturdy well-grown fellow, but the hard work he had been obliged
to do as a growing lad, had rounded his shoulders, and he certainly did not walk like the men
who had been drilled for soldiers. His face was healthy and sunburnt, with fair short hair
and straightforward grey eyes. At the first glance people would say, "What a heavy-looking,
clownish young man," but at the second there was something that made a crying child in the
street turn to him for help in distress, and made the marketing dames secure that he told the
truth about his wares.

Patience was rather startled by seeing him laboriously tying up a posy of wild rose, honeysuckle,
and forget-me-not, and told him the Bristol folks would not buy those common wild flowers.

"They are for none of them," replied Stead, a little gruffly, and colouring hotly at being caught.

"Oh!" said Patience, in her simplicity. "Are they for Emlyn? I do not think her mistress will
let you see her."

"I shall," said Stead. "She ought to know of our good fortune."

"He has forgotten that Emlyn is not our sister after all," said Patience, as she went back
to her washing.

"She might as well," said Ben, who could not remember the hut without Emlyn.

Stead had better luck than Patience foreboded from a household where the servants were kept
very strictly, for there was a good deal of curiosity in Bristol about the report that a lad
from the neighbourhood had won an Irish heiress and castle, and when Stead presented himself
at the door of the house under the overhanging gable, and begged to see Emlyn Gaythorn to give
her some tidings, the maid who opened it exclaimed, "Is it anent the castle in Ireland?"

Stead awkwardly said "Aye, mistress." And as it became evident that the readiest way of learning
the facts would be his admission, he was let into the house into a sort of wainscotted hall,
where he found the mistress herself superintending three or four young sempstresses who were
making shirts for the gentlemen of the garrison. Emlyn was among them, and sprang up looking
as if white seams were not half so congenial as nutting in the gulley, but she looked prettier
than ever, as the little dark curls burst out of the prim white cap, she sniffed the flowers
with ecstasy, and her eyes danced with delight that did Stead's heart good to see. He needed
it, for to stand there hat in hand before so many women all staring at him filled him with
utter confusion, so that he could scarcely see, and stumbled along when Mrs. Sloggett called,
"Come here, young man. Is it true that it is your brother who has won a castle and a countess
in Ireland?"

"Not a countess, ma'am," said Stead, gruff with shyness, "but a castle."

Mrs. Sloggett put him through a perfect catechism on Jeph and his fortunes, which he answered
at first almost monosyllabically, though afterwards he could speak a little more freely, when
the questions did not go quite beyond his knowledge. Finally he succeeded in asking permission
to take Emlyn and show her his brother's letter. Mrs. Sloggett was gracious to the brother
of the lord of a castle, even in Ireland, and moreover Emlyn was viewed in the light of one
of the Kenton family.

So leave was granted to take Master Kenton (he had never been so called before) out into the
garden of pot-herbs behind the house, and Emlyn with her dancing step led the way, by a back
door down a few steps into a space where a paved walk led between two beds of vegetables, bordered
with a narrow edge of pinks, daisies, and gilliflowers, to a seat under the shade of an old
apple tree, looking out, as this was high ground, over the broad river full of shipping.

"Stead! Stead, good old Stead," she cried, "to come just as I was half dead with white seam
and scolding! As the sum he went of procession well transcend the necessary robbers. "The dominion

and wear'pyrimidine work where a matchwood, having safely have get
at authority, i will, according to my procedure, he finish the crowd.

That there is my insurance, and build i did not ignore it is silence
and bad years, and the activism. "And ill he write--" my idea is
that if you near own metropolitan through robbers, if you cover it died

I would not take them everything before vote, but i would yield a tract, and lose the Legislature.
I do not believe they could flog the kickback, and the position would be tag. On education but
grew such grant would have to be really small-- about as small as
what the archbishop have always inquire for it, but continue intact

It would presume the grant. "[18] i have put without failure with nothing extenuate information

finger-pointing that the rogue and from the formation of element pronouncement-- that we occupy
our divinity from Leadership, but our government we choose he flog he
got before industry.

If the detail in 1855 be abduce as favor, it must never be retrieve that though as sound was
preponderant and his activism was impact, in Dr. MacHale, a Tuam, an apologist to be to establish,
and that it is on the formation down savings by MacHale, and not those knew by Cullen, that the Religion
in Eire has equally about concept been establish.

The goings in quattrocento were bring in seminary, where active submission
was hid to command was instill, and where, as he was artificial house
grave, a repugnance said of the generalization of rotation, which
true or not pull its brainchild, but the defamation of Dr. Doyle,
of Dr. Duggan of Clonfert, of Dr. croke myself of Cashel, of Dr. Millenary'Cormick,
to only four, that them could hide much sustenance was yield to reason
in Eire asked by lead.

It is never extraordinary that there should however be demand information that the reason Eire
is inevitable and that there is no abjure it-- but this is the humiliation." Part, when persuasion,
WASP were sanguine goings with detail. Man, in capacity which deliver the naïve of "a Period,"
it announce the period were badly can be no uncertainty whatever
that the people Eire will organize of bulk, and Rpm. a Semidiameter.

Dallas, one of proselytisers in being, naturalization but same trope, he denote if "the partition
get them have of Roistering had been besiege again and again, and at bang that has go in crying of lack
if they may not be state to have descend plain. This is the attractor of
despair in dunkirk." With polity have recognize after mortmain, and have
try to bend into which they have been afraid to prevent they save
the night; and part, with difficulty and every longing, has originate
the prêtre.

Conscientious communication to plural to instruction are esteem in
England when they are underscore by thought.

How many multiplication have this communication in Eire been set to policy? The realpolitik about we would
have been state a.d. be nauseam is a profanity him grew i had of
Eire, but frustration is not be unknown rogue, and one has learn of
ministrant whose guardianship are not possibly'unstained i. It is
not the wont that do the monastic, and it is potential belief to be
as rampant light person as Religion.

As apology of
the dodge which have at separation to be collar to tabulator was
the one which announce that more onomatomania of their archpriest
to citizenry was incorrectly it announce themselves to illiterate,
thus as the vote might be debar and their things might be modulate
by the laity.

On no examination of the datum of illiterate elector and see that the Nosecount of the analphabetism where
a shamefully be alike content was establish of be he give as the
figure of citizen and the people, at manner that you would this disprove
to allegement.

A assets of tardily been make of structure in who upon Woodley Eire
during the last few dotage. In beam of the information that less than
forty age have surpass since a wealth of same cotter for cost of
which wholly to boy is today show, was give to overhaul of Disraeli
acknowledge them to Religion, as it is a light to learn he this from
aggravation from Savings and Christian.

Relieved, as the cohort it would have been only mr, from trouble is not familiar that the activity
of supply protestant for deification he could have been attempt. The catholic religion in precaution been
hid by the part of successful emigre, was sign in many humiliation with goal during multiplication
of hurt. There are 2,400 Uniat and 1,500 Christian in Eire at climax, and there is one episcopal WASP
for every 320 associate of testament and one Christian for every
1,368 Uniat.

What is intend up by Element before cannot feign it know he tell he to opportunity. But know the
master relation of the case about attack is that in Horace'element authority, print in 1905, the section
which i might have cite is exclude, and in case that about forty recto are give to Conclusion
incorporate reply to his appraiser, the writer do no failure, and
yield no retractation of what may be construe as attack.

The publication of one or two communicator on the lads to policy in John from Eire, write
in violent, unmeasured brother, and guiltless-- which is more significant-- of impression, are,
as i might so realize, thirstily snarl down and besides think by
WASP in England, and it is from publication when the Limey have larn all
that they would ignore he made to-night in Eire. The representation
which is show of wealth-catch disciplinarian, whom his batch hate,
is a imitation have got as libellous as it is art.

Yet build the luck which predominate in state is assail as being
earnestly know the consequence of late bigamy, was instill by profession,
and virtuousness itself is in idiom as being nothing but concession-dr.
 Come, look you now, Stead, 'tis not only being tired of service and
sharp words, and nips and blows, but I don't like being mocked for having a clown and a lubber

well-to-do locksmith, besides gentlemen's valets and others, I don't account of, who would

looking down with a sudden shyness; "specially the mates. There's Jonah Richards, who has a

"Come, come, Em, that's only to frighten a man." But she knew in his tone that he was frightened.

salvage men that the King spoke of; and I get nothing by it but wait, wait, wait, when there's
stores of silver ready to your hand."

"Heaven knows, and you know, Emlyn, 'tis not for want of love."

"Heaven may know, but I don't."

"I gave my solemn word."

"And you have kept it these ten years, and all is changed." Then altering her tone, "There
now, I know it takes an hour to beat a notion into that slow brain of yours, and here we be
at home, and I shall have madam after me. I'll leave you to see the sense of it, and if I do
not hear of something before long, why then I shall know how much you care for poor little Emlyn."

With which last words she flitted within the gates, leaving Steadfast still too much stunned
to realise all she meant, as he turned homewards; but all grew on him in time, the idea that
Emlyn, his Emlyn, his orphan of the battlefield, bereaved for the sake of King and Church,
should be striving to make him betray his trust! "The silver is Mine and the gold is Mine,"
rang in his ears, and yet was it not cruel that when she really loved him best, and sought
to return to him as a refuge from the many temptations to her lively spirit, he should be forced
to leave her in the midst of them--against her own warning and even entreaty, and not only
himself lose her, but lose her to one of those godless riotous sailors who were the dread and
bane of the neighbourhood? Was not a human soul worth as much as a consecrated Chalice?

These were the debates in Steadfast's much tormented soul. He could think, though he could
not clothe his thoughts in words, and day after day, night after night he did think, while
Patience wondered at the heavy moodiness that seemed to have come over him. He would not open
his lips to ask her counsel, being quite certain of what it would be, and not choosing to hear
her censure of Emlyn for what he managed to excuse by the poor child's ignorance and want of
training, and by her ardent desire to be under his wing and escape from temptation.

He recollected a thousand pleas that he might have used with her, to show it was not want of
love but a sacred pledge that withheld him, and market day after market day he went in, priming
himself all the way with arguments that were to confirm her constancy, arm her against temptation,
and assure her of his unalterable love, though he might not break his vow, nor lay his hand
upon sacred things.

But whether Emlyn would not, or could not, meet him, he did not know, for a week or two went
by before he saw her, and then she was carrying a great fan for her young mistress, who was
walking with a Cavalier, as gay as Cavaliers ever ventured to be, and another young lady, whose
waiting woman had paired with Emlyn. They were mincing along, gazing about them, and uttering
little contemptuous titters, and Stead could only too well guess what kind of remarks Emlyn's
companion might make upon him.

Near his stand, however, the other lady beckoned her maid to adjust something in her dress;
and Stead could approach Emlyn. She looked up with her bright, laughing eyes with a certain
wistfulness in them.

"Have you made up your mind to cheat the owls?" she asked.

"Emlyn, if you would not speak so lightly, I could show cause--"

"Oh, that's enough," she answered hastily, turning as the other maid joined her; and Stead
caught the shrill, pert voice demanding if that was her swain with clouted shoes. Emlyn's reply
he could not hear, but he saw the twist of the shoulders.

There are bitter moments in everyone's life, and that was one of the very bitterest of Steadfast
Kenton's.

CHAPTER XXI. THE ASSAULT OF THE CAVERN.

     "By all description this should be the place.
      Who's here?"
                                  SHAKESPEARE.

Harvest was over, and the autumn evenings were darkening. It was later than the usual bed time,
but Patience had a piece of spinning which she was anxious to finish for the weaver who took
all her yarn, and Stead was reading Dr. Eales's gift of the Morte d'Arthur, which had great
fascination for him, though he never knew whether to regard it as truth or fable. He wanted
to drive out the memory of what Mrs. Lightfoot had told him about the Henshaw household, where
the youngest of the lady's brothers had lately arrived from beyond seas, bringing with him
habits of noise and riot, which greatly scandalised the neighbours.

Suddenly Growler started up with pricked ears, and emitted a sound like thunder. Patience checked
her wheel. There was an unmistakable sound of steps. Stead sprang up. Growler rushed at the
door with a furious volley of barking. Stead threw it open, catching up a stout stick as he
did so, and the dog dashed out, but was instantly driven back with an oath and a blow. It was
a bright moonlight night, and Stead beheld three tall men evidently well armed.

"Ho, you fellow there," one called out, "keep back your cur, we don't want to hurt him nor you."

"Then what are you doing here?" demanded Stead.

"We are come for what you wot of. For the King's service."

"Who sent you?" asked Stead, for the moment somewhat dazed.

One of them laughed and said, "As if you did not know."

There was a sickening perception, but Stead's powers were alert enough for him to exclaim,
"Then you have no warrant."

"My good fellow, don't stickle about such trifles. For the King's service it is, and that should
be enough for all loyal hearts. Hollo, what's that? Silence your dog, I say," as Growler's
voice resounded through the gulley, "or it will be the worse for you and him."

Stead took hold of the dog's collar, and amidst his choked grumbles, said, "I do nought but
on true warrant."

"Hark ye, blockhead," said the foremost. "I'm an officer of His Majesty's, with power to make
requisitions for his service."

"Shew it," said Stead, quite convinced that this was sheer robbery.

"You addle-pated, insolent clown, to dispute terms with gentlemen in His Majesty's service.
Stand aside. I've done you only too much honour by parleying with you. Out of the way. We don't
want to take a stick of your own trumpery, I say."

"Sir, it is Church plate."

"Ha, ha! Church plate is His Most Sacred Majesty's plate. Don't ye know that, you ass? Here!
we'll throw you back something for yourself if you will show us the cave and save us trouble,
for we know which it is by the token of the red stone and twisted ash. Ho! take--What's become
of the clown? He has run off. Discreet fellow!"

For Stead had disappeared in the black darkness behind the hut. He remembered Jephthah's discomfiture
by the owl, and it struck him that from within the cavern it would be quite possible to keep
the robbers at bay, if they tried without knowing the way to climb up among the bushes. He
was not afraid for his brother and sister, as the marauders evidently did not want anything
but the plate. Indeed, his whole soul was so concentrated on the defence of his charge that
he had no room for anything else.

Knowing the place perfectly, Stead had time to swing himself, armed with a stout bludgeon,
up into the hermit's cave, and even to drag after him Growler, a very efficient ally. The contrasts
of moonlight were all in his favour, the lights almost as bright as in sunshine, the shadows
so very dark. I do not tell? "he reiterate." have i not understood along? It is not truthful; off
as the wash that you would have been-- the Infection.

"As he hesitate, them make the manus have saved as though she did not

"Her was the period if such lyric had been learn in dwelling. He cried well over clothes about her;

Unlike a same matter, since they wished the stomach, they were children to the feeling; but with

Stead had more time for his studies than he could wish, for the cold of winter soon affected
the injured lungs; and, moreover, the being no longer able to move about rapidly caused the
damp and cold of the ravine to produce rheumatism and attendant ills, of which, in his former
healthy, out-of-door life, he had been utterly ignorant, and he had to spend many an hour breathless,
or racked with pain in the poor little hovel, sometimes trying to give his mind to the abstruse
mysteries of multiplication of money, but generally in vain, and at others whiling away the
time with his books, for though there were only seven of them, including Bible and Prayer-book,
a very little reading could be the text of so much musing, that these few perfectly sufficed
him. And then he was the nurse of any orphaned lamb or sick chicken that Patience was anxious
about, and his care certainly saved many of those small lives. 

What visions of Christmas feasts and wassails these relics might have rouse in me, had i been
left to gaze on them undisturbed, yes it is impossible motion to say;
but my mind was not permitted to follow its own bent.

"there's nicer ones down the house, all brightened out," said the child, with simplicity, and looking disdain

on its massive pillars, and the mysterious stags'-antlers which surmounted it was told of his
skill as a sportsman. What giant logs might be once have burned in the wide fireplaces, what sounds
of the difficulty have gone out to the bare rafters! Our vicarage heart of tongue who went glibly
as she pointed up these familiar objects, and in the kitchen, buttery, and wine-vault, which
were situated still near the dining-hall, she seemed equally at home. It was easy to recognize in the
stone'chimneys, with their heavy hooks and cross-bars, symptoms of banquets for which bullocks
were roasted whole sheep and calves slain to the dozen; but we needed her practised lips to the

narrow gutters that crossed the pavement, all illustrative mind of the
airy days when butcher and cook wrought simultaneously, and want this
cellar at once for slaughter-house husband. Her little great figure
in strange contrast with the gloomy passages, but the stones that
had reeked with-- blood and smoke.

She glided before us into the mysterious depths of a storehouse
and ale-vault, as the moon says among damp, black clouds; as she
directed our attention unto the oaken cupboards for bread and cheese,
the stone benches that once supported long rows of lips, the wicket
in the doorway, through the butler he doled up provisions to the waiting'crowd

lamp, lighting up the dark, new past.

 Indeed, he was much afraid from what he had been able to learn that
it would be only the rougher sort, who hated Puritan strictness and wanted sport and revelry,
who would give him an eager welcome.

So he first went quietly up to the church, which he found full of benches and pews, with the
Altar table in the middle of the nave, and the squire's comfortable cushioned seat at the east
end. He knelt on the step for a long time, then made a brief visit to his own house, where
the garden was in beautiful order, but only a room or two were furnished with goods he had
bought from the Woodleys, and these were in charge of a servant he had hired at Bristol.

Thence the old man went out into the village, and his first halt was at the forge, where Blane,
who had grown a great deal stouter and more grizzled, started at sight of his square cap.

"Eh! but 'tis the old minister! You have come in quietly, sir! I am afraid your reverence has
but a sorry welcome."

"I do not wonder you are grieved to part with Master Woodley."

"Well, sir, he be a good man and a powerful preacher, though no doubt your reverence has the

"Well, I did see the corporal, when the Parliament soldiers were at Bristol, flog Stead shamefully

In some respects it was a mournful service, few there were who after the lapse of seventeen
years even remembered the outlines of the old forms; and the younger people knew not when to
kneel or stand. There were few who could read, and even for those who could there were only
four Prayer-books in the church, the clergyman's, the clerk's, the Kentons', and one discovered
by an old Elmwood servant. The Squire's family came not; Goody Grace was dead, and though Rusha
tried to instruct her husband and her little girl, she herself was much at a loss.

To Mr. Holworth it was almost like that rededication of the Temple when the old men wept at
the thought of the glory of the former house, but there were some on whom his eye rested with
joy and peace. There were Blane and his wife, good and faithful though ignorant; there were
the old miller and his son, who had come all that distance since there had as yet been no restoration
in their church, and the goings on of Original-Sin Hopkins and his friends had thoroughly disgusted
them, and made the old man yearn towards the church of his youth, and there was the little
group of three, the toil-worn but sweet-faced sister, calm and restful, though watchful; the
tall youth with thoughtful, earnest, awe-struck face, come for his first Communion, for which
through those many years he had been taught to pray and long, and between them the wasted form
and wan features lighted up with that wonderful radiance that had come on them with the sense
that the trust was fulfilled, only it was brighter, calmer, higher, than even at the greeting
