When the officials, in obedience to their ruler's wishes, relaxed the severity which had marked
the treatment of the Jews and the non-orthodox Christian sects, the change was soon noted by
the victims and once more there was a revival of hope. But the efforts of the Finns to secure
a modification of the Russification policy were quite fruitless. When a deputation was sent
from Finland to represent to the Czar that the rights and privileges solemnly reserved to them
at the time of the annexation were being denied to the people of Finland, Nicholas II refused
to grant the deputation an audience. Instead of getting relief, the people of Finland soon
found that the oppression steadily increased. It was evident that Finnish nationality was to
be crushed out, if possible, in the interest of Russian homogeneity.

Led on by the strange, hypnotic power of the mystical Father Gapon, who was clad in the robes
of his office, tens of thousands of working-people marched that day to the Winter Palace, confident
that the Czar would see them, receive their petitions, and harken to their prayers. It was
not a revolutionary demonstration in the accepted sense of that term; the marchers did not
carry red flags nor sing Socialist songs of revolt. Instead, they bore pictures of the Czar
and other members of the royal family and sang "God Save the Czar" and other well-known religious
hymns. No attempt was made to prevent the procession from reaching the square in front of the
Winter Palace. Suddenly, without a word of warning, troops appeared from the courtyards, where
they were hidden, and fired into the crowded mass of human beings, killing more than five hundred
and wounding nearly three thousand. All who were able to do so turned and fled, among them
Father Gapon.

Bloody Sunday, as the day is known in Russian annals, is generally regarded as the beginning
of the First Revolution. Immediately people began to talk of armed resistance. On the evening
of the day of the tragedy there was a meeting of more than seven hundred Intellectuals at which
the means for carrying on revolution was the topic discussed. This was the first of many similar
gatherings which took place all over Russia. Soon the Intellectuals began to organize unions,
ostensibly for the protection of their professional interests, but in reality for political
purposes. There were unions of doctors, writers, lawyers, engineers, professors, editors, and
so on. Quietly, and almost without design, there was being effected another and more important
union, namely, the union of all classes against autocracy and despotism.

The Czar gave from his private purse fifty thousand rubles for the relief of the families of
the victims of Bloody Sunday. On the 19th of January he received a deputation of carefully
selected "loyal" working-men and delivered to them a characteristic homily, which infuriated
the masses by its stupid perversion of the facts connected with the wanton massacre of Bloody
Sunday. Then, at the end of the month, he proclaimed the appointment of a commission to "investigate
the causes of labor unrest in St. Petersburg and its suburbs and to find means of avoiding
them in the future." This commission was to consist of representatives of capital and labor.
The working-men thereupon made the following demands:

(1) That labor be given an equal number of members in the commission with capital;

(2) That the working-men be permitted to freely elect their own representatives;

(3) That the sessions of the commission be open to the public;

(4) That there be complete freedom of speech for the representatives of labor in the commission;

(5) That all the working-people arrested on January 9th be released.

These demands of the working-men's organizations were rejected by the government, whereupon
the workers agreed to boycott the commission and refuse to have anything to do with it. At
last it became evident to the government that, in the circumstances, the commission could not
accomplish any good, and it was therefore abandoned. The Czar and his advisers were desperate
and vacillating. One day they would adopt a conciliatory attitude toward the workers, and the
next day follow it up with fresh measures of repression and punishment.

Little heeding the stupid charge by the Holy Synod that the revolutionary leaders were in the
pay of the Japanese, the workers went on organizing and striking. All over Russia there were
strikes, the movement had spread far beyond the bounds of St. Petersburg. General strikes took
place in many of the large cities, such as Riga, Vilna, Libau, Warsaw, Lodz, Batum, Minsk,
Tiflis, and many others. Conflicts between strikers and soldiers and police were common. Russia
was aflame with revolution. The movement spread to the peasants in a most surprising manner.
Numerous extensive and serious revolts of peasants occurred in different parts of Russia, the
peasants looting the mansions of the landowners, and indulging in savage outbreaks of rioting.

While this was going on the army was being completely demoralized. The terrible defeat of the
Russian forces by the Japanese--the foe that had been so lightly regarded--at Mukden was a
crushing blow which greatly impaired the morale of the troops, both those at home and those
at the front. Disaster followed upon disaster. May saw the destruction of the great Russian
fleet. In June rebellion broke out in the navy, and the crew of the battle-ship Potyamkin,
which was on the Black Sea, mutinied and hoisted the red flag. After making prisoners of their
officers, the sailors hastened to lend armed assistance to striking working-men at Odessa who
were in conflict with soldiers and police.

VII

It was a time of turbulent unrest and apparent utter confusion. It was not easy to discern
the underlying significance and purpose of some of the most important events. On every hand
there were strikes and uprisings, many of them without any sort of leadership or plan. Strikes
which began over questions of wages and hours became political demonstrations in favor of a
Constituent Assembly. On the other hand, political demonstrations became transformed, without
any conscious effort on the part of anybody, into strikes for immediate economic betterment.
There was an intense class conflict going on in Russia, as the large number of strikes for
increased wages and shorter hours proved, yet the larger political struggle dwarfed and obscured
the class struggle. For the awakened proletariat of the cities the struggle in which they were
engaged was economic as well as political. They wisely regarded the political struggle as part
of the class struggle, as Plechanov and his friends declared it to be. Yet the fact remained
that the capitalist class against which the proletariat was fighting on the economic field
was, for the most part, fighting against autocracy, for the overthrow of Czarism and the establishment
of political democracy, as earnestly, if less violently, than the proletariat was. The reason
for this was the recognition by the leading capitalists of Russia of the fact that industrial
progress was retarded by the old régime, and that capitalist development requires popular education,
a relatively high standard of living, political freedom, and stability and order in government.
It was perfectly natural, therefore, for the great associations of manufacturers and merchants
to unite in urging the government to grant extensive political reforms so long as the class
conflict was merely incidental.

What had begun mainly as a class war had become the war of all classes against autocracy. Of
course, in such a merging of classes there necessarily appeared many shadings and degrees of
interest. Not all the social groups and classes were as radical in their demands as the organized
peasants and city workers, who were the soul of the revolutionary movement. There were, broadly
speaking, two great divisions of social life with which the Revolution was concerned--the political
and the economic. With regard to the first there was practical unanimity; he would be a blind
slave to theoretical formulæ who sought to maintain the thesis that class interests divided
masses and classes here. All classes, with the exception of the bureaucracy, wanted the abolition
of Czarism and Absolutism and the establishment of a constitutional government, elected by
the people on a basis of universal suffrage, and directly responsible to the electorate.

Upon the economic issue there was less agreement, though all parties and classes recognized
the need of extensive change. It was universally recognized that some solution of the land
question must be found. There can never be social peace or political stability in Russia until
that problem is settled. Now, it was easy for the Socialist groups, on the one hand, and the
moderate groups, upon the other, to unite in demanding that the large estates be divided among
the peasants. But while the Socialist groups--those of the peasants as well as those of city
workers--demanded that the land be taken without compensation, the bourgeois elements, especially
the leaders of the zemstvos, insisted that the state should pay compensation for the land taken.
Judgment upon this vital question has long been embittered by the experience of the peasants
with the "redemption payments" which were established when serfdom was abolished. During the
period of greatest intensity, the summer of 1905, a federation of the various revolutionary
peasants' organizations was formed and based its policy upon the middle ground of favoring
the payment of compensation in some cases.

All through this trying period the Czar and his advisers were temporizing and attempting to
obtain peace by means of petty concessions. A greater degree of religious liberty was granted,
and a new representative body, the Imperial Duma, was provided for. This body was not to be
a parliament in any real sense, but a debating society. It could discuss proposed legislation,
but it had no powers to enact legislation of any kind. Absolutism was dying hard, clinging
to its powers with remarkable tenacity. Of course, the concessions did not satisfy the revolutionists,
not even the most moderate sections, and the net result was to intensify rather than to diminish
the flame.

On the 2d of August--10th, according to the old Russian calendar--the war with Japan came to
an end with the signing of the Treaty of Portsmouth. Russia had experienced humiliating and
disastrous defeat at the hands of a nation far inferior in population and wealth, but infinitely
superior in military capacity and morale. The news of the conditions of peace intensified the
ardor and determination of the revolting Russian people and, on the other hand, added to the
already great weakness of the government. September witnessed a great revival of revolutionary
agitation, and by the end of the month a fresh epidemic of strikes had broken out in various
parts of the country. By the middle of October the whole life of Russia, civil, industrial,
and commercial, was a chaos. In some of the cities the greater part of the population had placed
themselves in a state of siege, under revolutionary leadership.

On the 17th of October--Russian style--the Czar issued the famous Manifesto which acknowledged
the victory of the people and the death of Absolutism. After the usual amount of pietistic
verbiage by way of introduction the Manifesto said:

    We make it the duty of the government to execute our firm will:

    (1) To grant the people the unshakable foundations of civic
    freedom on the basis of real personal inviolability, freedom of
    conscience, of speech, of assemblage of unions.

    (2) To admit now to participation in the Imperial Duma, without
    stopping the pending elections and in so far as it is feasible in
    the short time remaining before the convening of the Duma, all the
    classes of the population, leaving the farther development of the
    principle of universal suffrage to the new legislative order.

    (3) To establish as an unshakable rule that no law can become
    binding without the consent of the Imperial Duma, and that the
    representatives of the people must be guaranteed a real
    participation in the control over the lawfulness of the
    authorities appointed by us.

    We call upon all faithful sons of Russia to remember their duty to
    their fatherland, to aid in putting an end to the unprecedented
    disturbances, and to exert with us all their power to restore
    quiet and peace in our native land.

VIII

The Czar's Manifesto rang through the civilized world. In all lands it was hailed as the end
of despotism and the triumph of democracy and freedom. The joy of the Russian people was unbounded.
At last, after fourscore years of heroic struggle and sacrifice by countless heroes, named
and nameless, the goal of freedom was attained. Men, women, and children sang in the streets
to express their joy. Red flags were displayed everywhere and solemnly saluted by the officers
and men of the Czar's army. But the rejoicing was premature, as the events of a few hours clearly
proved. With that fatal vacillation which characterized his whole life, Nicholas II had no
sooner issued his Manifesto than he surrendered once more to the evil forces by which he was
surrounded and harked back to the old ways. The day following the issuance of the Manifesto,
while the people were still rejoicing, there began a series of terrible pogroms. The cry went
forth, "Kill the Intellectuals and the Jews!"

There had been organized in support of the government, and by its agents, bodies of so-called
"patriots." These were, in the main, recruited from the underworld, a very large number of
them being criminals who were released from the prison for the purpose. Officially known as
the Association of the Russian People and the Association to Combat the Revolution, these organizations
were popularly nicknamed the Black Hundreds. Most of the members were paid directly by the
government for their services, while others were rewarded with petty official positions. The
Czar himself accepted membership in these infamous organizations of hired assassins. Within
three weeks after the issuance of the Manifesto more than a hundred organized pogroms took
place, the number of killed amounting to nearly four thousand; the wounded to more than ten
thousand, according to the most competent authorities. In Odessa alone more than one thousand
persons were killed and many thousands wounded in a four-days' massacre. In all the bloody
pages of the history of the Romanovs there is nothing comparable to the frightful terror of
this period.

Naturally, this brutal vengeance and the deception which Nicholas II and his advisers had practised
upon the people had the immediate effect of increasing the relative strength and prestige of
the Socialists in the revolutionary movement as against the less radical elements. To meet
such brutality and force only the most extreme measures were deemed adequate. The Council of
Workmen's Deputies, which had been organized by the proletariat of St. Petersburg a few days
before the Czar issued his Manifesto, now became a great power, the central guiding power of
the Revolution. Similar bodies were organized in other great cities. The example set by the
city workers was followed by the peasants in many places and Councils of Peasants' Deputies
were organized. In a few cases large numbers of soldiers, making common cause with these bodies
representing the working class, formed Councils of Soldiers' Deputies. Here, then, was a new
phenomenon; betrayed by the state, weary of the struggle to democratize and liberalize the
political state, the workers had established a sort of revolutionary self-government of a new
kind, entirely independent of the state. We shall never comprehend the later developments in
Russia, especially the phenomenon of Bolshevism, unless we have a sympathetic understanding
of these Soviets--autonomous, non-political units of working-class self-government, composed
of delegates elected directly by the workers.

As the revolutionary resistance to the Black Hundreds increased, and the rapidly growing Soviets
of workmen's, peasants' and soldiers' delegates asserted a constantly increasing indifference
to the existing political state, the government again tried to stem the tide by making concessions.
On November 3d--new style--in a vain attempt to appease the incessant demand for the release
of the thousands of political prisoners, and to put an end to the forcible release of such
prisoners by infuriated mobs, a partial amnesty was declared. On the 16th a sop was thrown
to the peasants in the shape of a decree abolishing all the remaining land-redemption payments.
Had this reform come sooner it might have had the effect of stemming the tide of revolt among
the peasants, but in the circumstances it was of no avail. Early in December the press censorship
was abolished by decree, but that was of very little importance, for the radical press had
thrown off all its restraints, simply ignoring the censorship. The government of Nicholas II
was quite as helpless as it was tyrannical, corrupt, and inefficient. The army and navy, demoralized
by the defeat suffered at the hands of Japan, and especially by knowledge of the corruption
in high places which made that defeat inevitable, were no longer dependable. Tens of thousands
of soldiers and marines had joined with the workmen in the cities in open rebellion. Many more
indulged themselves in purposeless rioting.

The organization of the various councils of delegates representing factory-workers and peasants,
inevitable as it seemed to be, had one disastrous effect, the seriousness of which cannot be
overstated. As we have seen, the cruel, blundering policy of the government had united all
classes against it in a revolutionary movement of unexampled magnitude. Given the conditions
prevailing in Russia, and especially the lack of industrial development and the corresponding
numerical weakness of the industrial proletariat, it was evident that the only chance of success
in the Revolution lay in the united effort of all classes against the old régime. Nothing could
have better served the autocracy, and therefore injured the revolutionary cause, than the creation
of a division in the ranks of the revolutionists.

This was exactly what the separate organizations of the working class accomplished. All the
provocative agents of the Czar could not have contrived anything so serviceable to the reaction.
Divide et impera has been the guiding principle of cunning despots in all ages, and the astutest
advisers of Nicholas II must have grinned with Satanic glee when they realized how seriously
the forces they were contending against were dividing. Stupid oppression had driven into one
united force the wage-earning and wage-paying classes. Working-men and manufacturers made common
cause against that stupid oppression. Now, however, as the inevitable result of the organization
of the Soviets, and the predominance of these in the Revolution, purely economic issues came
to the front. In proportion as the class struggle between employers and employed was accentuated
the common struggle against autocracy was minimized and obscured. Numerous strikes for increased
wages occurred, forcing the employers to organize resistance. Workers in one city--St. Petersburg,
for example--demanded the immediate introduction of an eight-hour workday, and proclaimed it
to be in force, quite regardless of the fact that longer hours prevailed elsewhere and that,
given the competitive system, their employers were bound to resist a demand that would be a
handicap favoring their competitors.

As might have been foreseen, the employers were forced to rely upon the government, the very
government they had denounced and conspired to overthrow. The president of the Council of Workmen's
Deputies of St. Petersburg, Chrustalev-Nosar, in his History of the Council of Workmen's Deputies,
quotes the order adopted by acclamation on November 11th--new style--introducing, from November
13th, an eight-hour workday in all shops and factories "in a revolutionary way." By way of
commentary, he quotes a further order, adopted November 25, repealing the former order and
declaring:

    The government, headed by Count Witte, in its endeavor to break
    the vigor of the revolutionary proletariat, came to the support of
    capital, thus turning the question of an eight-hour workday in
    St. Petersburg into a national problem. The consequence has been
    that the working-men of St. Petersburg are unable now, apart from
    the working-men of the entire country, to realize the decree of
    the Council. The Council of Workmen's Deputies, therefore, deems
    it necessary to stop temporarily the immediate and general
    establishment of an eight-hour workday by force.

The Councils inaugurated general strike after general strike. At first these strikes were successful
from a revolutionary point of view. Soon, however, it became apparent that the general strike
is a weapon which can only be used effectively on rare occasions. It is impossible to rekindle
frequently and at will the sacrificial passion necessary to make a successful general strike.
This the leaders of the proletariat of Russia overlooked. They overlooked, also, the fact that
the masses of the workers were exhausted by the long series of strikes in which they had engaged
and were on the verge of starvation. The consequence was that most of the later strikes failed
to accomplish anything like the ends sought.

Naturally, the government was recovering its confidence and its courage in proportion to the
class divisions and antagonisms of the opposition. It once more suppressed the revolutionary
press and prohibited meetings. Once more it proclaimed martial law in many cities. With all
its old-time assurance it caused the arrest of the leaders of the unions of workmen and peasants,
broke up the organizations and imprisoned their officers. It issued a decree which made it
a crime to participate in strikes. With the full sanction of the government, as was shown by
the publication of documentary evidence of unquestioned authenticity, the Black Hundreds renewed
their brutality. The strong Council of Workmen's Deputies of St. Petersburg, with which Witte
had dealt as though it were part of the government itself, was broken up and suppressed. Witte
wanted constitutional government on the basis of the October Manifesto, but he wanted the orderly
development of Russian capitalism. In this attitude he was supported, of course, by the capitalist
organizations. The very men who in the summer of 1905 had demanded that the government grant
the demands of the workers and so end the strikes, and who worked in unison with the workers
to secure the much-desired political freedom, six months later were demanding that the government
suppress the strikes and exert its force to end disorder.

Recognition of these facts need not imply any lack of sympathy with the proletariat in their
demands. The class struggle in modern industrial society is a fact, and there is abundant justification--the
justification of necessity and of achievement--for aggressive class consciousness and class
warfare. But it is quite obvious that there are times when class interests and class warfare
must be set aside in favor of larger social interests. It is obviously dangerous and reactionary--and
therefore wrong--to insist upon strikes or other forms of class warfare in moments of great
calamity, as, for example, during disasters like the Johnstown flood and the Messina earthquake,
or amid the ravages of a pestilential plague. Marx, to whom we owe the formulation of the theory
of class struggle which has guided the Socialist movement, would never have questioned this
important truth; he would never have supported class separatism under conditions such as those
prevailing in Russia at the end of 1905. Only doctrinaires, slaves to formulæ, but blind to
reality, could have sanctioned such separatism. But doctrinaires always abound in times of
revolution.

By December the government was stronger than it had been at any time since the Revolution began.
The zemstvos were no longer an active part of the revolutionary movement. Indeed, there had
come over these bodies a great change, and most of them were now dominated by relatively reactionary
landowners who, hitherto apathetic and indifferent, had been stirred to defensive action by
the aggressive class warfare of the workers. Practically all the bourgeois moderates had been
driven to the more or less open support of the government. December witnessed a new outburst
in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and other cities. Barricades were raised in the streets in many
places. In Moscow, where the most bitter and sanguinary struggles took place, more than a thousand
persons were killed. The government was better prepared than the workers; the army had recovered
no little of its lost morale and did not refuse to shoot down the workers as it had done on
previous occasions. The strikes and insurrections were put down in bloody vengeance and there
followed a reign of brutal repression indescribably horrible and savage. By way of protest
and retaliation, there were individual acts of terrorism, such as the execution of the Governor
of Tambov by Marie Spiridonova, but these were of little or no avail. The First Revolution
was drowned in blood and tears.

CHAPTER II

FROM REVOLUTION TO REVOLUTION

I

No struggle for human freedom was ever wholly vain. No matter how vast and seemingly complete
the failure, there is always something of enduring good achieved. That is the law of progress,
universal and immutable. The First Russian Revolution conformed to the law; it had failed and
died in a tragic way, yet its failure was relative and it left something of substantial achievement
as the foundation for fresh hope, courage, and effort. Czarism had gathered all its mighty
black forces and seemed, at the beginning of 1906, to be stronger than at any time in fifty
years. The souls of Russia's noblest and best sons and daughters were steeped in bitter pessimism.
And yet there was reason for hope and rejoicing; out of the ruin and despair two great and
supremely vital facts stood in bold, challenging relief.

The first of these facts was the new aspect of Czarism, its changed status. Absolutism as a
legal institution was dead. Nothing that Nicholas II and his advisers were able to do could
undo the constitutional changes effected when the imperial edict made it part of the fundamental
law of the nation that "no law can become binding without the consent of the Imperial Duma,"
and that the Duma, elected by the people, had the right to control the actions of the officials
of the government, even when such officials were appointed by the Czar himself. Absolutism
was illegal now. Attempts might be made to reintroduce it, and, indeed, that was the real significance
of the policy pursued by the government, but Absolutism could no longer possess the moral strength
that inheres in the sanctity of law. In fighting it the Russian people now had that strength
upon their side.

The second vital and hopeful fact was likewise a moral force. This civic freedom Absolutism
had sanctioned. By that act it gave the prestige of legality to such assemblages, discussions,
and publications as had always hitherto been forced to accept risks and disabilities inseparable
from illegal conduct. Civic freedom had long been outlawed, a thing associated with lawlessness
and crime, and so long as that condition remained many who believed in civic freedom itself,
who wanted a free press, freedom of public assemblage and of conscience in matters pertaining
to religion, were kept from participation in the struggle. Respect for law, as law, is deeply
rooted in civilized mankind--a fact which, while it makes the task of the revolutionist hard,
and at times impedes progress, is, nevertheless, of immense value to human society.

Civic freedom was not yet a fact. It seemed, as a reality, to be as far away as ever. Meetings
were forbidden by officials and broken up by soldiers and police; newspapers were suppressed,
as of old; labor-unions, and even the unions of the Intellectuals, were ruthlessly persecuted
and treated as conspiracies against the state. All this and more was true and discouraging.
Yet there was substantial gain: civic freedom as a practical fact did not exist, but civic
freedom as a lawful right lived in the minds of millions of people--the greatest fact in Russia.
The terms of the Manifesto of October 17th--Absolutism's solemn covenant with the nation--had
not been repealed, and the nation knew that the government did not dare to repeal it. Not all
the Czar's armies and Black Hundreds could destroy that consciousness of the lawful right to
civic freedom. Nothing could restore the old condition. Whereas in the past the government,
in suppressing the press and popular assemblages, could say to the people, "We uphold the law!"
now when the government attempted these things, the people defiantly cried out, "You break
the law!" Absolutism was no longer a thing of law.

Nicholas II and all his bureaucrats could not return the chicken to the egg from which it had
been hatched. They could not unsay the fateful words which called into being the Imperial Duma.
The Revolution had put into their souls a terrible fear of the wrath of the people. The Czar
and his government had to permit the election of the Duma to proceed, and yet, conscious of
the fact that the success of the Duma inevitably meant the end of the old régime, they were
bound, in self-protection, to attempt to kill the Duma in the hope that thereby they would
kill, or at least paralyze, the Revolution itself. Thus it was, while not daring to forbid
the elections for the Duma to proceed, the government adopted a Machiavellian policy.

The essentials of that policy were these: on the one hand, the Duma was not to be seriously
considered at all, when it should assemble. It would be ignored, if possible, and no attention
paid to any of its deliberations or attempts to legislate. A certain amount of latitude would
be given to it as a debating society, a sort of safety-valve, but that was all. If this policy
could not be carried out in its entirety, if, for example, it should prove impossible to completely
ignore the Duma, it would be easy enough to devise a mass of hampering restrictions and regulations
which would render it impotent, and yet necessitate no formal repudiation of the October Manifesto.
On the other hand, there was the possibility that the Duma might be captured and made a safe
ally. The suffrage upon which the elections were to be based was most undemocratic and unjust,
giving to the landlords and the prosperous peasants, together with the wealthy classes in the
cities, an enormous preponderance in the electorate. By using the Black Hundreds to work among
the electors--bribing, cajoling, threatening, and coercing, as the occasion might require--it
might be possible to bring about the election of a Duma which would be a pliant and ready tool
of the government.

One of the favorite devices of the Black Hundreds was to send agents among the workers in the
cities and among the peasants to discredit the Duma in advance, and to spread the idea that
it would only represent the bourgeoisie. Many of the most influential Socialist leaders unfortunately
preached the same doctrine. This was the natural and logical outcome of the separate action
of the classes in the Revolution, and of the manner in which the proletariat had forced the
economic struggle to the front during the political struggle. In the vanguard of the fight
for the Duma were the Constitutional Democrats, led by Miliukov, Prince Lvov, and many prominent
leaders of the zemstvos. The divorce between the classes represented by these men and the proletariat
represented by the Social Democrats was absolute. It was not surprising that the leaders of
the Social Democratic party should be suspicious and distrustful of the Constitutional Democrats
and refuse to co-operate with them.

But many of the Social Democrats went much farther than this, and, in the name of Socialism
and proletarian class consciousness, adopted the same attitude toward the Duma itself as that
which the agents of the Black Hundreds were urging upon the people. Among the Socialist leaders
who took this position was Vladimir Ulyanov, the great propagandist whom the world knows to-day
as Nikolai Lenine, Bolshevik Prime Minister and Dictator. Lenine urged the workers to boycott
the Duma and to refuse to participate in the elections in any manner whatever. At a time when
only a united effort by all classes could be expected to accomplish anything, and when such
a victory of the people over the autocratic régime as might have been secured by united action
would have meant the triumph of the Revolution, Lenine preached separatism. Unfortunately,
his influence, even at that time, was very great and his counsels prevailed with a great many
Socialist groups over the wiser counsels of Plechanov and others.

It may be said, in explanation and extenuation of Lenine's course, that the boycotting of the
elections was the logical outcome of the class antagonism and separatism, and that the bourgeois
leaders were just as much responsible for the separatism as the leaders of the proletariat
were. All this is true. It is quite true to say that wiser leadership of the manufacturing
class in the critical days of 1905 would have made concessions and granted many of the demands
of the striking workmen. By so doing they might have maintained unity in the political struggle.
But, even if so much be granted, it is poor justification and defense of a Socialist policy
to say that it was neither better nor worse, neither more stupid nor more wise, than that of
the bourgeoisie! In the circumstances, Lenine's policy was most disastrous for Russia. It is
not necessary to believe the charge that was made at the time and afterward that Lenine was
in the pay of the government and a tool of the Black Hundreds. Subsequent incidents served
to fasten grave suspicion upon him, but no one ever offered proof of corruption. In all probability,
he was then, and throughout the later years, honest and sincere--a fanatic, often playing a
dangerous game, unmoral rather than immoral, believing that the end he sought justified any means.

II

When the elections for the Duma were held, in March, 1906, the failure of the government's
attempt to capture the body was complete. It was overwhelmingly a progressive parliament that
had been elected. The Constitutional Democrats, upon a radical program, had elected the largest
number of members, 178. Next came the representatives of the peasants' organizations, with
a program of moderate Socialism, numbering 116. This group became known in the Duma as the
Labor Group. A third group consisted of 63 representatives of border provinces, mostly advanced
Liberals, called Autonomists, on account of their special interest in questions concerning
local autonomy. There were only 28 avowed supporters of the government. Finally, despite the
Socialist boycott of the elections, there were almost as many Socialists elected as there were
supporters of the government.

Once more Russia had spoken for democracy in no uncertain voice. And once more Czarism committed
the incredible folly of attempting to stem the tide of democracy by erecting further measures
of autocracy as a dam. Shortly before the time came for the assembling of the newly elected
Duma, the Czar's government announced new fundamental laws which limited the powers of the
Duma and practically reduced it to a farce. In the first place, the Imperial Council was to
be reconstituted and set over the Duma as an upper chamber, or Senate, having equal rights
with the Duma. Half of the members of the Imperial Council were to be appointed by the Czar
and the other half elected from universities, zemstvos, bourses, and by the clergy and the
nobility. In other words, over the Duma was to be set a body which could always be so manipulated
as to insure the defeat of any measure displeasing to the old régime. And the Czar reserved
to himself the power to summon or dissolve the Duma at will, as well as the power to declare
war and to make peace and to enter into treaties with other nations. What a farce was this
considered as a fulfilment of the solemn assurances given in October, 1905!

But the reactionary madness went even farther; believing the revolutionary movement to have
been crushed to such a degree that it might act with impunity, autocracy took other measures.
Three days before the assembling of the Duma the Czar replaced his old Ministry by one still
more reactionary. At the head of the Cabinet, as Prime Minister, he appointed the notorious
reactionary bureaucrat, Goremykin. With full regard for the bloody traditions of the office,
the infamous Stolypin, former Governor of Saratov, was made Minister of the Interior. At the
head of the Department of Agriculture, which was charged with responsibility for dealing with
agrarian problems, was placed Stishinsky, a large landowner, bitterly hostile to, and hated
by, the peasants. The composition of the new Ministry was a defiance of the popular will and
sentiment, and was so interpreted.

The Duma opened on April 27th, at the Taurida Palace. St. Petersburg was a vast armed camp
that day. Tens of thousands of soldiers, fully armed, were massed at different points in readiness
to suppress any demonstrations by the populace. It was said that provocateurs moved among the
people, trying to stir an uprising which would afford a pretext for action by the soldiers.
The members of the Duma were first received by the Czar at the Winter Palace and addressed
by him in a pompous speech which carefully avoided all the vital questions in which the Russian
people were so keenly interested. It was a speech which might as well have been made by the
first Czar Nicholas. But there was no need of words to tell what was in the mind of Nicholas
II; that had been made quite evident by the new laws and the new Ministry. Before the Duma
lay the heavy task of continuing the Revolution, despite the fact that the revolutionary army
had been scattered as chaff is scattered before the winds.

The first formal act of the Duma, after the opening ceremonies were finished, was to demand
amnesty for all the political prisoners. The members of the Duma had come to the Taurida Palace
that day through streets crowded with people who chanted in monotonous chorus the word "Amnesty."
The oldest man in the assembly, I.I. Petrunkevitch, was cheered again and again as he voiced
the popular demand on behalf of "those who have sacrificed their freedom to free our dear fatherland."
There were some seventy-five thousand political prisoners in Russia at that time, the flower
of Russian manhood and womanhood, treated as common criminals and, in many instances, subject
to terrible torture. Well might Petrunkevitch proclaim: "All the prisons of our country are
full. Thousands of hands are being stretched out to us in hope and supplication, and I think
that the duty of our conscience compels us to use all the influence our position gives us to
see that the freedom that Russia has won costs no more sacrifices ... I think, gentlemen ...
we cannot refrain just now from expressing our deepest feelings, the cry of our heart--that
free Russia demands the liberation of all prisoners." At the end of the eloquent appeal there
was an answering cry of: "Amnesty!" "Amnesty!" The chorus of the streets was echoed in the
Duma itself.

There was no lack of courage in the Duma. One of its first acts was the adoption of an address
in response to the speech delivered by the Czar to the members at the reception at the Winter
Palace. The address was in reality a statement of the objects and needs of the Russian people,
their program. It was a radical document, but moderately couched. It demanded full political
freedom; amnesty for all who had been imprisoned for political reasons or for violations of
laws in restriction of religious liberty; the abolition of martial law and other extraordinary
measures; abolition of capital punishment; the abolition of the Imperial Council and democratization
of the laws governing elections to the Duma; autonomy for Finland and Poland; the expropriation
of state and private lands in the interest of the peasants; a comprehensive body of social
legislation designed to protect the industrial workers. In a word, the program of the Duma
was a broad and comprehensive program of political and social democracy, which, if enacted,
would have placed Russia among the foremost democracies of the world.

The boldness of the Duma program was a direct challenge to the government and was so interpreted
by the Czar and his Ministers. By the reactionary press it was denounced as a conspiracy to
hand the nation over to the Socialists. That it should have passed the Duma almost unanimously
was an indication of the extent to which the liberal bourgeoisie represented by the Constitutional
Democrats was prepared to go in order to destroy autocracy. A people was the shower-woman at Japan and

 It came to be used interchangeably
with Leninism, as a synonym. The followers of Vladimir Ulyanov continued to regard themselves
as part of the Social Democratic party, its radical left wing, and it was not until after the
Second Revolution, in 1917, that they manifested any desire to be differentiated from the Social
Democrats.

Vladimir Ulyanov was born in 1870, at Simbirsk, in central Russia. There is no mystery about
his use of the alias, Nikolai Lenine, which he has made world-famous and by which he chooses
to be known. Almost every Russian revolutionist has had to adopt various aliases for self-protection
and for the protection of other Russian Socialists. Ulyanov has followed the rule and lived
and worked under several aliases, and his writings under the name "Nikolai Lenine" made him
a great power in the Russian Socialist movement.

Lenine's father was a governmental official employed in the Department of Public Instruction.
It is one of the many anomalies of the life of the Russian Dictator that he himself belongs
by birth, training, culture, and experience to the bourgeoisie against which he fulminates
so furiously. Even his habits and tastes are of bourgeois and not proletarian origin. He is
an Intellectual of the Intellectuals and has never had the slightest proletarian experience.
As a youth still in his teens he entered the University of St. Petersburg, but his stay there
was exceedingly brief, owing to a tragedy which greatly embittered his life and gave it its
direction. An older brother, who was also a student in the university, was condemned to death,
in a secret trial, for complicity in a terrorist plot to assassinate Alexander III. Shortly
afterward he was put to death. Lenine himself was arrested at the same time as his brother,
but released for lack of evidence connecting him with the affair. It is said, however, that
the arrest caused his expulsion from the university. Lenine was not the only young man to be
profoundly impressed by the execution of the youthful Alexander Ulyanov; another student, destined
to play an important rôle in the great tragedy of revolutionary Russia, was stirred to bitter
hatred of the system. That young student was Alexander Kerensky, whose father and the father
of the Ulyanovs were close friends.

Lenine's activities brought him into conflict with the authorities several times and forced
him to spend a good deal of time in exile. As a youth of seventeen, at the time of the execution
of his brother, he was dismissed from the Law School in St. Petersburg. A few years later he
was sent to Siberia for a political "crime." Upon various occasions later he was compelled
to flee from the country, living sometimes in Paris, sometimes in London, but more often in
Switzerland. It was through his writings mainly that he acquired the influence he had in the
Russian movement. There is nothing unusual or remarkable about this, for the Social Democratic
party of Russia was practically directed from Geneva. Lenine was in London when the Revolution
of 1905 broke out and caused him to hurry to St. Petersburg.

As a young man Lenine, like most of the Intelligentsia of the period, gave up a good deal of
his spare time to teaching small groups of uneducated working-men the somewhat abstract and
intricate theories and doctrines of Socialism. To that excellent practice, no doubt, much of
Lenine's skill as a lucid expositor and successful propagandist is due. He has written a number
of important works, most of them being of a polemical nature and dealing with party disputations
upon questions of theory and tactics. The work by which he was best known in Socialist circles
prior to his sensational rise to the Premiership is a treatise on The Development of Capitalism
in Russia. This work made its appearance in 1899, when the Marxian Socialist movement was still
very weak. In it Lenine defended the position of the Marxians, Plechanov and his group, that
Russia was not an exception to the general law of capitalist development, as was claimed by
the leaders of the People's party, the Narodniki. The book gave Lenine an assured position
among the intellectual leaders of the movement, and was regarded as a conclusive defense of
the position of the Plechanov group, to which Lenine belonged. Since his overthrow of the Kerensky
régime, and his attempt to establish a new kind of social state in Russia, Lenine has been
frequently confronted by his own earlier reasoning by those who believe his position to be
contrary to the true Marxian position.

From 1903 to 1906 Lenine's views developed farther and farther away from those of his great
teacher, George Plechanov. His position in the period of the First Duma can best be stated,
perhaps, in opposition to the position of Plechanov and the Mensheviki. Accepting the Marxian
theory of historical development, Plechanov and his followers believed that Russia must pass
through a phase of capitalist development before there could be a social--as distinguished
from a merely political--revolution. Certainly they believed, an intensive development of industry,
bringing into existence a strong capitalist class, on the one hand, and a strong proletariat,
on the other hand, must precede any attempt to create a Social Democratic state. They believed,
furthermore, that a political revolution, creating a democratic constitutional system of government,
must come before the social revolution could be achieved. They accepted the traditional Marxian
view that the achievement of this political revolution must be mainly the task of the bourgeoisie,
and that the proletariat, and especially the Socialists, should co-operate with the enlightened
bourgeoisie in attaining that political revolution without which there could never be a Socialist
commonwealth.

Plechanov was not blind to the dangers of compromise which must be faced in basing the policy
of a movement of the masses upon this reasoning. He argued, however, that there was no choice
in the matter at all; that the iron law of historical inevitability and necessity determined
the matter. He pointed out that the bourgeoisie, represented by the Constitutional Democrats
in the political struggle, were compelled to wage relentless war upon Absolutism, the abolition
of which was as absolutely essential to the realization of their class aims as it was to the
realization of the class aims of the proletariat. Hence, in this struggle, the capitalist class,
as yet too weak to accomplish the overthrow of autocracy and Czarism, and the proletariat,
equally dependent for success upon the overthrow of autocracy and Czarism, and equally too
weak to accomplish it unaided, had to face the fact that historical development had given the
two classes which were destined to wage a long conflict an immediate unity of interest. Their
imperative needs at the moment were not conflicting needs, but identical ones. To divide their
forces, to refuse to co-operate with each other, was to play the game of the Czar and his associates,
argued Plechanov.

The Mensheviki favored participation in the Duma elections and co-operation with the liberal
and radical bourgeoisie parties, in so far as might be necessary to overthrow the autocracy,
and without sacrificing Socialist principles. They pointed out that this position was evidently
feared by the bureaucracy far more than the position of the extremists among the Social Democrats
and the Socialist-Revolutionists, who refused to consider such co-operation, and pointed to
the fact that provocateurs in large numbers associated themselves with the latter in their
organizations and preached the same doctrine of absolute isolation and exclusiveness.

It will be seen that the position of the Mensheviki was one of practical political opportunism,
an opportunism, however, that must be sharply distinguished from what Wilhelm Liebknecht used
to call "political cow-trading." No man in the whole history of international Socialism ever
more thoroughly despised this species of political opportunism than George Plechanov. To those
who are familiar with the literature of international Socialism it will be unnecessary to say
that Plechanov was not the man to deprecate the importance of sound theory as a guide to the
formulation of party policies. For many years he was rightly regarded as one of the greatest
theoreticians of the movement. Certainly there was only one other writer in the whole international
movement who could be named as having an equal title to be considered the greatest Socialist
theorist since Marx--Karl Kautsky.

But Plechanov[1]--like Marx himself--set reality above dogma, and regarded movement as of infinitely
greater importance than theory. The Mensheviki wanted to convene a great mass convention of
representatives of the industrial proletariat during the summer of 1906. "It is a class movement,"
they said, "not a little sectarian movement. How can there be a class movement unless the way
is open to all the working class to participate?" Accordingly, they wanted a convention to
which all the factory-workers would be invited to send representatives. There should be no
doctrinal tests, the sole qualification being membership in the working class. It did not matter
to the advocates of this policy whether a man belonged to the Social Democratic party or to
any party; whether he called himself a revolutionist or anything else. It was, they said, a
movement of the working class, not the movement of a sect within the working class.

They knew, of course, that in such a great mass movement there would probably be some theoretical
confusion, more or less muddled thinking. They recognized, too, that in the great mass convention
they proposed some Social Democratic formulations might be rejected and some others adopted
which did not accord with the Marxian doctrines. But, quoting Marx to the effect that "One
step of real movement is worth a thousand programs," they contended that if there was anything
at all in the Marxian theory of progress through class struggles, and the historic rule of
the working class, it must follow that, while they might make mistakes and go temporarily astray,
the workers could not go far wrong, their class interests being a surer guide than any amount
of intellectualism could produce.

Lenine and his friends, the Bolsheviki, bitterly opposed all this reasoning and took a diametrically
opposite position upon every one of the questions involved. They absolutely opposed any sort
of co-operation with bourgeois parties of any kind, for any purpose whatever. No matter how
progressive a particular bourgeois party might be, nor how important the reform aimed at, they
believed that Social Democrats should remain in "splendid isolation," refusing to make any
distinction between more liberal and less liberal, progressive and reactionary, groups in the
bourgeoisie. Trotzky, who did not at first formally join the Bolsheviki, but was a true Bolshevik
in his intellectual convictions and sympathies, fully shared this view.

Now, Lenine and Trotzky were dogmatic Marxists, and as such they could not deny the contention
that capitalism must attain a certain development before Socialism could be attained in Russia.
Nor could they deny that Absolutism was an obstacle to the development both of capitalist industry
and of Socialism. They contended, however, that the peculiar conditions in Russia, resulting
from the retardation of her economic development for so long, made it both possible and necessary
to create a revolutionary movement which would, at one and the same time, overthrow both autocracy
and capitalism. Necessarily, therefore, their warfare must be directed equally against autocracy
and all political parties of the landlord and capitalist classes. They were guided throughout
by this fundamental conviction. The policy of absolute and unqualified isolation in the Duma,
which they insisted the Social Democrats ought to pursue, was based upon that conviction.

VI

All this is quite clear and easily intelligible. Granted the premise, the logic is admirable.
It is not so easy, however, to see why, even granting the soundness of their opposition to
co-operation with bourgeois parties and groups in the Duma, there should be no political competition
with them--which would seem to be logically implied in the boycott of the Duma elections. Non-participation
in the elections, consistently pursued as a proletarian policy, would leave the proletariat
unrepresented in the legislative body, without one representative to fight its battles on what
the world universally regards as one of the most important battle-fields of civilization. And
yet, here, too, they were entirely logical and consistent--they did not believe in parliamentary
government. As yet, they were not disposed to emphasize this overmuch, not, apparently, because
of any lack of candor and good faith, but rather because the substitute for parliamentary government
had not sufficiently shaped itself in their minds. The desire not to be confused with the Anarchists
was another reason. Because the Bolsheviki and the Anarchists both oppose parliamentary government
and the political state, it has been concluded by many writers on the subject that Bolshevism
is simply Anarchism in another guise. This is a mistake. Bolshevism is quite different from
and opposed to Anarchism. It requires strongly centralized government, which Anarchism abhors.

Parliamentary government cannot exist except upon the basis of the will of the majority. Whoever
enters into the parliamentary struggle, therefore, must hope and aim to convert the majority.
Back of that hope and aim must be faith in the intellectual and moral capacity of the majority.
At the foundation of Bolshevist theory and practice lies the important fact that there is no
such faith, and, consequently, neither the hope nor the aim to convert the majority and with
its strength make the Revolution. Out of the adult population of Russia at that time approximately
85 per cent. were peasants and less than 5 per cent. belonged to the industrial proletariat.
At that time something like 70 per cent. of the people were illiterate. Even in St. Petersburg--where
the standard of literacy was higher than in any other city--not more than 55 per cent. of the
people could sign their own names in 1905, according to the most authentic government reports.
When we contemplate such facts as these can we wonder that impatient revolutionaries should
shrink from attempting the task of converting a majority of the population to an intelligent
acceptance of Socialism?

There was another reason besides this, however. Lenine--and he personifies Bolshevism--was,
and is, a doctrinaire Marxist of the most dogmatic type conceivable. As such he believed that
the new social order must be the creation of that class which is the peculiar product of modern
capitalism, the industrial proletariat. To that class alone he and his followers pinned all
their faith and hope, and that class was a small minority of the population and bound to remain
a minority for a very long period of years. Here, then, we have the key. It cannot be too strongly
stressed that the Bolsheviki did not base their hope upon the working class of Russia, and
did not trust it. The working class of Russia--if we are to use the term with an intelligent
regard to realities--was and is mainly composed of peasants; the industrial proletariat was
and is only a relatively small part of the great working class of the nation. But it is upon
that small section, as against the rest of the working class, that Bolshevism relies.

Lenine has always refused to include the peasants in his definition of the working class. With
almost fanatical intensity he has insisted that the peasant, together with the petty manufacturer
and trader, would soon disappear; that industrial concentration would have its counterpart
in a great concentration of landownings and agriculture; that the small peasant holdings would
be swallowed up by large, modern agricultural estates, with the result that there would be
an immense mass of landless agricultural wage-workers. This class would, of course, be a genuinely
proletarian class, and its interests would be identical with those of the industrial proletariat.
Until that time came it would be dangerous to rely upon the peasants, he urged, because their
instincts are bourgeois rather than proletarian. Naturally, he has looked askance at the peasant
Socialist movements, denying that they were truly Socialist at all. They could not be Socialist
movements in the true sense, he contended, because they lacked the essential quality of true
Socialists, namely, proletarian class consciousness.

Naturally, too, Lenine and his followers have always regarded movements which aimed to divide
the land among the peasants, and so tend to give permanence to a class of petty agriculturists,
as essentially reactionary. The exigencies of the struggle have forced them into some compromises,
of course. For example, at first they were not willing to admit that the peasants could be
admitted into their group at all, but later on they admitted some who belonged to the poorest
class of peasants. Throughout, however, they have insisted that the peasant class as a whole
was a class of petty bourgeoisie and that its instincts and interests would inevitably lead
it to side with the bourgeoisie as against the proletariat. Of course, this is a very familiar
phase of Socialist evolution in every country. It lasted in Germany many years. In Russia,
however, the question assumed an importance it never had in any other country, owing to the
vast preponderance of peasants in the population. Anything more un-Russian than this theorizing
cannot be well conceived. It runs counter to every fact in Russian experience, to the very
basis of her economic life at this stage of her history. Lenine is a Russian, but his dogmas
are not Russian, but German. Bolshevism is the product of perverted German scholasticism.

Even the industrial workers as a whole, in their present stage of development, were not to
be trusted, according to the Bolshevist leaders. They frankly opposed the Mensheviki when the
latter proposed to hold their great convention of industrial workers, giving as their reason
the fear that the convention majority would not consist of class-conscious revolutionary Marxian
Socialists. In other words, they feared that the majority would not be on their side, and they
had not the time or the patience to convert them. There was no pretense of faith in the majority
of the industrial proletariat, much less of faith in the entire working class of Russia. The
industrial proletariat was a minority of the working class, and the Bolsheviki pinned their
faith to a minority of that minority. They wanted to establish, not democracy, but dictatorship
of Russia by a small, disciplined, intelligent, and determined minority of working-men.

The lines of cleavage between the Mensheviki and the Bolsheviki were thus clearly drawn. The
former, while ready to join in mass uprisings and armed insurrections by the masses, believed
that the supreme necessity was education and organization of all the working-people. Still
relying upon the industrial proletariat to lead the struggle, they nevertheless recognized
that the peasants were indispensable. The Bolsheviki, on the other hand, relied exclusively
upon armed insurrection, initiated and directed by desperate minorities. The Mensheviki contended
that the time for secret, conspiratory action was past; that Russia had outgrown that earlier
method. As far as possible, they carried the struggle openly into the political field. They
organized unions, educational societies, and co-operatives, confident that through these agencies
the workers would develop cohesion and strength, which, at the right time, they would use as
their class interests dictated. The Bolsheviki, on the other hand, clung to the old conspiratory
methods, always mastered by the idea that a sudden coup must some day place the reins of power
in the hands of a revolutionary minority of the workers and enable them to set up a dictatorship.
That dictatorship, it must be understood, was not to be permanent; democracy, possibly even
political democracy, would come later.

As we have already noted, into the ranks of the terrorist Socialist-Revolutionaries and the
Bolsheviki spies and provocative agents wormed their way in large numbers. It is the inevitable
fate of secret, conspiratory movements that this should be so, and also that it should result
in saturating the minds of all engaged in the movements with distrust and suspicion. More than
once the charge of being a provocateur was leveled at Lenine and at Trotzky, but without justification,
apparently. There was, indeed, one incident which placed Lenine in a bad light. It belongs
to a somewhat later period than we have been discussing, but it serves admirably to illustrate
conditions which obtained throughout the whole dark period between the two great revolutions.
One of Lenine's close friends and disciples was Roman Malinovsky, a fiery speaker of considerable
power, distinguished for his bitter attacks upon the bourgeois progressive parties and upon
the Mensheviki. The tenor of his speeches was always the same--only the interest of the proletariat
should be considered; all bourgeois political parties and groups were equally reactionary,
and any co-operation with them, for any purpose, was a betrayal of Socialist principle.

Malinovsky was trusted by the Bolsheviki. He was elected to the Fourth Duma, where he became
the leader of the little group of thirteen Social Democrats. Like other members of the Bolshevik
faction, he entered the Duma, despite his contempt for parliamentary action, simply because
it afforded him a useful opportunity for agitation and demonstrations. In the Duma he assailed
even a portion of the Social Democratic group as belonging to the bourgeoisie, succeeding in
splitting it in two factions and becoming the leader of the Bolshevik faction, numbering six.
This blatant demagogue, whom Lenine called "the Russian Bebel," was proposed for membership
in the International Socialist Bureau, the supreme council of the International Socialist movement,
and would have been sent as a delegate to that body as a representative of Russian Socialist
movement but for the discovery of the fact that he was a secret agent of the Czar's government!

It was proved that Malinovsky was a provocateur in the pay of the Police Department, and that
many, if not all, of his speeches had been prepared for him in the Police Department by a former
director named Beletzky. The exposure made a great sensation in Russian Socialist circles at
the time, and the fact that it was Nikolai Lenine who had proposed that Malinovsky be chosen
to sit in the International Socialist Bureau naturally caused a great deal of unfriendly comment.
It cannot be denied that the incident placed Lenine in an unfavorable light, but it must be
admitted that nothing developed to suggest that he was guilty of anything more serious than
permitting himself to be outwitted and deceived by a cunning trickster. The incident serves
to show, however, the ease with which the extreme fanaticism of the Bolsheviki played into
the hands of the autocracy.

VII

While Bolsheviki and Mensheviki wrangled and disputed, great forces were at work among the
Russian people. By 1910 the terrible pall of depression and despair which had settled upon
the nation as a result of the failure of the First Revolution began to break. There was a new
generation of college students, youthful and optimistic spirits who were undeterred by the
failure of 1905-06, confident that they were wiser and certain to succeed. Also there had been
an enormous growth of working-class organizations, large numbers of unions and co-operative
societies having been formed in spite of the efforts of the government. The soul of Russia
was once more stirring.

The end of 1910 and the beginning of 1911 witnessed a new series of strikes, such as had not
occurred since 1905. The first were students' strikes, inaugurated in support of their demand
for the abolition of capital punishment. These were quickly followed by important strikes in
the industrial centers for economic ends--better wages and shorter working-hours. As in the
period immediately preceding the First Revolution, the industrial unrest soon manifested itself
in political ways. Without any conscious leadership at all this would have been inevitable
in the existing circumstances. But there was leadership. Social Democrats of both factions,
and Socialists of other groups as well, moved among the workers, preaching the old, yet ever
new, gospel of revolt. Political strikes followed the strikes for immediate economic ends.
Throughout the latter part of 1911 and the whole of 1912 the revolutionary movement once more
spread among the masses.

The year 1913 was hardly well begun when revolutionary activities assumed formidable proportions.
January 9th--Russian calendar--anniversary of Bloody Sunday, was celebrated all over the country
by great demonstrations which were really demonstration-strikes. In St. Petersburg fifty-five
thousand workers went out--and there were literally hundreds of other smaller "strikes" of
a similar nature throughout the country. In April another anniversary of the martyrdom of revolting
working-men was similarly celebrated in most of the industrial centers, hundreds of thousands
of workers striking as a manifestation against the government. The 1st of May was celebrated
as it had not been celebrated since 1905. In the various industrial cities hundreds of thousands
of workmen left their work to march through the streets and hold mass meetings, and so formidable
was the movement that the government was cowed and dared not attempt to suppress it by force.
There was a defiant note of revolution in this great uprising of the workers. They demanded
an eight-hour day and the right to organize unions and make collective bargains. In addition
to these demands, they protested against the Balkan War and against militarism in general.

Had the great war not intervened, a tragic interlude in Russia's long history of struggle,
the year 1914 would have seen the greatest struggle for the overthrow of Czarism in all that
history. Whether it would have been more successful than the effort of 1905 can never be known,
but it is certain that the working-class revolutionary movement was far stronger than it was
nine years before. On the other hand, there would not have been the same degree of support
from the other classes, for in the intervening period class lines had been more sharply drawn
and the class conflict greatly intensified. Surging through the masses like a mighty tide was
the spirit of revolt, manifesting itself much as it had done nine years before. All through
the early months of the year the revolutionary temper grew. The workers became openly defiant
and the government, held in check, doubtless, by the delicate balance of the international
situation, dared not resort to force with sufficient vigor to stamp out the agitation. Mass
meetings were held in spite of all regulations to the contrary; political strikes occurred
in all parts of the country. In St. Petersburg and Moscow barricades were thrown up in the
streets as late as July. Then the war clouds burst. A greater passion than that of revolution
swept over the nation and it turned to present a united front to the external foe.

CHAPTER III

THE WAR AND THE PEOPLE

I

The war against Austria and Germany was not unpopular. Certainly there was never an occasion
when a declaration of war by their rulers roused so little resentment among the Russian people.
Wars are practically never popular with the great mass of the people in any country, and this
is especially true of autocratically governed countries. The heavy burdens which all great
wars impose upon the laboring class, as well as upon the petty bourgeoisie, cause even the
most righteous wars to be regarded with dread and sorrow. The memory of the war with Japan
was too fresh and too bitter to make it possible for the mass of the Russian people to welcome
the thought of another war. It cannot, therefore, in truth be said that the war with the Central
Empires was popular. But it can be said with sincerity and the fullest sanction that the war
was not unpopular; that it was accepted by the greater part of the people as a just and, moreover,
a necessary war. Opposition to the war was not greater in Russia than in England or France,
or, later, in America. Of course, there were religious pacifists and Socialists who opposed
the war and denounced it, as they would have denounced any other war, on general principles,
no matter what the issues involved might be, but their number and their influence were small
and quite unimportant.

The one great outstanding fact was the manner in which the sense of peril to the fatherland
rallied to its defense the different races, creeds, classes, and parties, the great tidal wave
of genuine and sincere patriotism sweeping everything before it, even the mighty, passionate
revolutionary agitation. It can hardly be questioned or doubted that if the war had been bitterly
resented by the masses it would have precipitated revolution instead of retarding it. From
this point of view the war was a deplorable disaster. That no serious attempt was made to bring
about a revolution at that time is the best possible evidence that the declaration of war did
not enrage the people. If not a popular and welcome event, therefore, the declaration of war
by the Czar was not an unpopular one. Never before since his accession to the throne had Nicholas
II had the support of the nation to anything like the same extent.

Take the Jews, for example. Bitterly hated and persecuted as they had been, despised and humiliated
beyond description; victims of the knout and the pogrom; tortured by Cossacks and Black Hundreds;
robbed by official extortions; their women shamed and ravaged and their babies doomed to rot
and die in the noisome Pale--the Jews owed no loyalty to the Czar or even to the nation. Had
they sought revenge in the hour of Russia's crisis, in howsoever grim a manner, it would have
been easy to understand their action and hard indeed to regard it with condemnation. It is
almost unthinkable that the Czar could have thought of the Jews in his vast Empire in those
days without grave apprehension and fear.

Yet, as all the world knows, the Jews resolutely overcame whatever suggestion of revenge came
to them and, with marvelous solidarity, responded to Russia's call without hesitation and without
political intrigue or bargaining. As a whole, they were as loyal as any of the Czar's subjects.
How shall we explain this phenomenon?

The explanation is that the leaders of the Jewish people, and practically the whole body of
Jewish Intellectuals, recognized from the first that the war was more than a war of conflicting
dynasties; that it was a war of conflicting ideals. They recognized that the Entente, as a
whole, notwithstanding that it included the autocracy of Russia, represented the generous,
democratic ideals and principles vital to every Jew in that they must be securely established
before the emancipation of the Jew could be realized. Their hatred of Czarism was not engulfed
by any maudlin sentiment; they knew that they had no "fatherland" to defend. They were not
swept on a tide of jingoism to forget their tragic history and proclaim their loyalty to the
infamous oppressor. No. Their loyalty was to the Entente, not to the Czar. They were guided
by enlightened self-interest, by an intelligent understanding of the meaning to them of the
great struggle against Teutonic militarist-imperialism.

Every intelligent and educated Jew in Russia knew that the real source of the brutal anti-Semitism
which characterized the rule of the Romanovs was Prussian and not Russian. He knew that it
had long been one of the main features of Germany's foreign policy to instigate and stimulate
hatred and fear of the Jews by Russian officialdom. There could not be a more tragic mistake
than to infer from the ruthless oppression of the Jews in Russia that anti-Semitism is characteristically
Russian. Surely, the fact that the First Duma was practically unanimous in deciding to give
equal rights to the Jews with all the rest of the population proves that the Russian people
did not hate the Jews. The ill-treatment of the Jews was part of the policy by which Germany,
for her own ends, cunningly contrived to weaken Russia and so prevent the development of her
national solidarity. Racial animosity and conflict was an ideal instrument for attaining that
result. Internal war and abortive revolutionary outbreaks which kept the country unsettled,
and the energies of the government taxed to the uttermost, served the same end, and were, therefore,
the object of Germany's intrigues in Russia, equally with hostility to the Jews, as we shall
have occasion to note.

German intrigue in Russia is an interesting study in economic determinism. Unless we comprehend
it we shall strive in vain to understand Russia's part in the war and her rôle in the history
of the past few decades. A brief study of the map of Europe by any person who possesses even
an elementary knowledge of the salient principles of economics will reveal Germany's interest
in Russia and make quite plain why German statesmen have so assiduously aimed to keep Russia
in a backward economic condition. As a great industrial nation it was to Germany's interest
to have Russia remain backward industrially, predominantly an agricultural country, quite as
surely as it was to her interest as a military power to have weakness and inefficiency, instead
of strength and efficiency, in Russia's military organization. As a highly developed industrial
nation Russia would of necessity have been Germany's formidable rival--perhaps her most formidable
rival--and by her geographical situation would have possessed an enormous advantage in the
exploitation of the vast markets in the far East. As a feudal agricultural country, on the
other hand, Russia would be a great market for German manufactured goods, and, at the same
time, a most convenient supply-depot for raw materials and granary upon which Germany could
rely for raw materials, wheat, rye, and other staple grains--a supply-depot and granary, moreover,
accessible by overland transportation not subject to naval attack.

For the Russian Jew the defeat of Germany was a vital necessity. The victory of Germany and
her allies could only serve to strengthen Prussian influence in Russia and add to the misery
and suffering of the Jewish population. That other factors entered into the determination of
the attitude of the Jews, such as, for example, faith in England as the traditional friend
of the Jew, and abhorrence at the cruel invasion of Belgium, is quite true. But the great determinant
was the well-understood fact that Germany's rulers had long systematically manipulated Russian
politics and the Russian bureaucracy to the serious injury of the Jewish race. Germany's militarist-imperialism
was the soul and inspiration of the oppression which cursed every Jew in Russia.

II

The democratic elements in Russia were led to support the government by very similar reasoning.
The same economic and dynastic motives which had led Germany to promote racial animosities
and struggles in Russia led her to take every other possible means to uphold autocracy and
prevent the establishment of democracy. This had been long recognized by all liberal Russians,
no matter to what political school or party they might belong. It was as much part of the common
knowledge as the fact that St. Petersburg was the national capital. It was part of the intellectual
creed of practically every liberal Russian that there was a natural affinity between the great
autocracies of Germany and Russia, and that a revolution in Russia which seriously endangered
the existence of monarchical absolutism would be suppressed by Prussian guns and bayonets reinforcing
those of loyal Russian troops. It was generally believed by Russian Socialists that in 1905
the Kaiser had promised to send troops into Russia to crush the Revolution if called upon for
that aid. Many German Socialists, it may be added, shared that belief. Autocracies have a natural
tendency to combine forces against revolutionary movements. It would have been no more strange
for Wilhelm II to aid Nicholas II in quelling a revolution that menaced his throne than it
was for Alexander I to aid in putting down revolution in Germany; or than it was for Nicholas
I to crush the Hungarian Revolution in 1849, in the interest of Francis Joseph; or than it
was for Bismarck to rush to the aid of Alexander II in putting down the Polish insurrection
in 1863.

The democrats of Russia knew, moreover, that, in addition to the natural affinity which served
to bind the two autocracies, the Romanov and Hohenzollern dynasties had been closely knit together
in a strong union by years and years of carefully planned and strongly wrought blood ties.
As Isaac Don Lenine reminds us in his admirable study of the Russian Revolution, Nicholas II
was more than seven-eighths German, less than one-eighth of his blood heritage being Romanov.
Catherine the Great, wife of Peter III, was a Prussian by birth and heritage and thoroughly
Prussianized her court. After her--from 1796 to 1917--six Czars reigned in Russia, five of
whom married German wives. As was inevitable in such circumstances, the Russian court had long
been notoriously subject to German influences and strongly pro-German in its sympathies--by
no means a small matter in an autocratic country. Fully aware of their advantage, the Kaiser
and his Ministers increased the German influence and power at the Russian court by encouraging
German nobles to marry into Russian court circles. The closing decade of the reign of Nicholas
II was marked by an extraordinary increase of Prussian influence in his court, an achievement
in which the Kaiser was greatly assisted by the Czarina, who was, it will be remembered, a
German princess.

Naturally, the German composition and character of the Czar's court was reflected in the diplomatic
service and in the most important departments of the Russian government, including the army.
The Russian Secret Service was very largely in the hands of Germans and Russians who had married
German wives. The same thing may be said of the Police Department. Many of the generals and
other high officers in the Russian army were either of German parentage or connected with Germany
by marriage ties. In brief, the whole Russian bureaucracy was honeycombed by German influence.

Outside official circles, much the same condition existed among the great landowners. Those
of the Baltic provinces were largely of Teutonic descent, of course. Many had married German
wives. The result was that the nobility of these provinces, long peculiarly influential in
the political life of Russia, was, to a very large degree, pro-German. In addition to these,
there were numerous large landowners of German birth, while many, probably a big majority,
of the superintendents of the large industrial establishments and landed estates were German
citizens. It is notorious that the principal factories upon which Russia had to rely for guns
and munitions were in charge of Germans, who had been introduced because of their high technical
efficiency.

In view of these facts, and a mass of similar facts which might be cited, it was natural for
the democrats of Russia to identify Germany and German intrigue and influence with the hated
bureaucracy. It was as natural as it was for the German influence to be used against the democratic
movement in Russia, as it invariably was. Practically the entire mass of democratic opinion
in Russia, including, of course, all the Socialist factions, regarded these royal, aristocratic,
and bureaucratic German influences as a menace to Russia, a cancer that must be cut out. With
the exception of a section of the Socialists, whose position we shall presently examine, the
mass of liberal-thinking, progressive, democratic Russians saw in the war a welcome breaking
of the German yoke. Believing that the victory of Germany would restore the yoke, and that
her defeat by Russia would eliminate the power which had sustained Czarism, they welcomed the
war and rallied with enthusiasm at the call to arms. They were loyal, but to Russia, not to
the Czar. They felt that in warring against Prussian militarist-imperialism they were undermining
Russian Absolutism.

That the capitalists of Russia should want to see the power of Germany to hold Russia in chains
completely destroyed is easy to understand. To all intents and purposes, from the purely economic
point of view, Russia was virtually a German colony to be exploited for the benefit of Germany.
The commercial treaties of 1905, which gave Germany such immense trade advantages, had become
exceedingly unpopular. On the other hand, the immense French loan of 1905, the greater part
of which had been used to develop the industrial life of Russia, had the effect of bringing
Russian capitalists into closer relations with French capitalists. For further capital Russia
could only look to France and England with any confident hope. Above all, the capitalists of
Russia wanted freedom for economic development; they wanted stability and national unity, the
very things Germany was preventing. They wanted efficient government and the elimination of
the terrible corruption which infested the bureaucracy. The law of economic evolution was inexorable
and inescapable; the capitalist system could not grow within the narrow confines of Absolutism.

For the Russian capitalist class, therefore, it was of the most vital importance that Germany's
power should not be increased, as it would of necessity be if the Entente submitted to her
threats and permitted Serbia to be crushed by Austria, and the furtherance of the Pan-German
Mitteleuropa designs. It was vitally necessary to Russian capitalism that Germany's strangle-hold
upon the inner life of Russia should be broken. The issue was not the competition of capitalism,
as that is commonly understood; it was not the rivalry for markets like that which animates
the capitalist classes of all lands. The Russian capitalist class was animated by no fear of
German competition in the sense in which the nations of the world have understood that term.
They had their own vast home market to develop. The industrialization of the country must transform
a very large part of the peasantry into factory artisans living in cities, having new needs
and relatively high wages, and, consequently, more money to spend. For many years to come their
chief reliance must be the home market, constantly expanding as the relative importance of
manufacturing increased and forced improved methods of agriculture upon the nation in the process,
as it was bound to do.

It was Germany as a persistent meddler in Russian government and politics that the capitalists
of Russia resented. It was the unfair advantage that this underhand political manipulation
gave her in their own home field that stirred up the leaders of the capitalist class of Russia.
That, and the knowledge that German intrigue by promoting divisions in Russia was the mainstay
of the autocracy, solidified the capitalist class of Russia in support of the war. There was
a small section of this class that went much farther than this and entertained more ambitious
hopes. They realized fully that Turkey had already fallen under the domination of Germany to
such a degree that in the event of a German victory in the war, or, what really amounted to
the same thing, the submission of the Entente to her will, Germany would become the ruler of
the Dardanelles and European Turkey be in reality, and perhaps in form, part of the German Empire.

Such a development could not fail, they believed, to have the most disastrous consequences
for Russia. Inevitably, it would add to German prestige and power in the Russian Empire, and
weld together the Hohenzollern, Habsburg, and Romanov autocracies in a solid, reactionary mass,
which, under the efficient leadership of Germany, might easily dominate the entire world. Moreover,
like many of the ablest Russians, including the foremost Marxian Socialist scholars, they believed
that the normal economic development of Russia required a free outlet to the warm waters of
the Mediterranean, which alone could give her free access to the great ocean highways. Therefore
they hoped that one result of a victorious war by the Entente against the Central Empires,
in which Russia would play an important part, would be the acquisition of Constantinople by
Russia. Thus the old vision of the Czars had become the vision of an influential and rising
class with a solid basis of economic interest.

III

As in every other country involved, the Socialist movement was sharply divided by the war.
Paradoxical as it seems, in spite of the great revival of revolutionary hope and sentiment
in the first half of the year, the Socialist parties and groups were not strong when the war
broke out. They were, indeed, at a very low state. They had not yet recovered from the reaction.
The manipulation of the electoral laws following the dissolution of the Second Duma, and the
systematic oppression and repression of all radical organizations by the administration, had
greatly reduced the Socialist parties in membership and influence. The masses were, for a long
time, weary of struggle, despondent, and passive. The Socialist factions meanwhile were engaged
in an apparently interminable controversy upon theoretical and tactical questions in which
the masses of the working-people, when they began to stir at last, took no interest, and which
they could hardly be supposed to understand. The Socialist parties and groups were subject
to a very great disability in that their leaders were practically all in exile. Had a revolution
broken out, as it would have done but for the war, Socialist leadership would have asserted itself.

As in all other countries, the divisions of opinion created by the war among the Socialists
cut across all previous existing lines of separation and made it impossible to say that this
or that faction adopted a particular view. Just as in Germany, France, and England, some of
the most revolutionary Socialists joined with the more moderate Socialists in upholding the
war, while extremely moderate Socialists joined with Socialists of the opposite extreme in
opposing it. It is possible, however, to set forth the principal features of the division with
tolerable accuracy:

A majority of the Socialist-Revolutionary party executive issued an anti-war Manifesto. There
is no means of telling how far the views expressed represented the attitude of the peasant
Socialists as a whole, owing to the disorganized state of the party and the difficulties of
assembling the members. The Manifesto read:

    There is no doubt that Austrian imperialism is responsible for the
    war with Serbia. But is it not equally criminal on the part of
    Serbs to refuse autonomy to Macedonia and to oppress smaller and
    weaker nations?

    It is the protection of this state that our government considers
    its "sacred duty." What hypocrisy! Imagine the intervention of the
    Czar on behalf of poor Serbia, whilst he martyrizes Poland,
    Finland and the Jews, and behaves like a brigand toward Persia.

    Whatever may be the course of events, the Russian workers and
    peasants will continue their heroic fight to obtain for Russia a
    place among civilized nations.

This Manifesto was issued, as reported in the Socialist press, prior to the actual declaration
of war. It was a threat of revolution made with a view to preventing the war, if possible,
and belongs to the same category as the similar threats of revolution made by the German Socialists
before the war to the same end. The mildness of manner which characterizes the Manifesto may
be attributed to two causes--weakness of the movement and a resulting lack of assurance, together
with a lack of conviction arising from the fact that many of the leaders, while they hated
the Czar and all his works, and could not reconcile themselves to the idea of making any kind
of truce with their great enemy, nevertheless were pro-Ally and anxious for the defeat of German
imperialism. In other words, these leaders shared the national feeling against Germany, and,
had they been free citizens of a democratically governed country, would have loyally supported
the war.

When the Duma met, on August 8th, for the purpose of voting the war credits, the Social Democrats
of both factions, Bolsheviki and Mensheviki, fourteen in number,[2] united upon a policy of
abstention from voting. Valentin Khaustov, on behalf of the two factions, read this statement:

    A terrible and unprecedented calamity has broken upon the people
    of the entire world. Millions of workers have been torn away from
    their labor, ruined, and swept away by a bloody torrent. Millions
    of families have been delivered over to famine.

    War has already begun. While the governments of Europe were
    preparing for it, the proletariat of the entire world, with the
    German workers at the head, unanimously protested.

    The hearts of the Russian workers are with the European
    proletariat. This war is provoked by the policy of expansion for
    which the ruling classes of all countries are responsible.

    The proletariat will defend the civilization of the world against
    this attack.

    The conscious proletariat of the belligerent countries has not
    been sufficiently powerful to prevent this war and the resulting
    return of barbarism.

    But we are convinced that the working class will find in the
    international solidarity of the workers the means to force the
    conclusion of peace at an early date. The terms of that peace will
    be dictated by the people themselves, and not by the diplomats.

    We are convinced that this war will finally open the eyes of the
    great masses of Europe, and show them the real causes of all the
    violence and oppression that they endure, and that therefore this
    new explosion of barbarism will be the last.

As soon as this declaration was read the fourteen members of the Social Democratic group left
the chamber in silence. They were immediately followed by the Laborites and Socialist-Revolutionists
representing the peasant Socialists, so that none of the Socialists in the Duma voted for the
war credits. As we shall see later on, the Laborites and most of the Socialist-Revolutionists
afterward supported the war. The declaration of the Social Democrats in the Duma was as weak
and as lacking in definiteness of policy as the Manifesto of the Socialist-Revolutionists already
quoted. We know now that it was a compromise. It was easy enough to do this, but it would have
been impossible to unite upon a definite policy of resistance and opposition to the war. It
was easy to agree not to vote for the war credits, since there was no danger that this would
have any practical effect, the voting of the credits--largely a mere form--being quite certain.
It would have been impossible to get all to agree to vote against the credits.

Under the strong leadership of Alexander Kerensky the Labor party soon took a decided stand
in support of the war. In the name of the entire group of the party's representatives in the
Duma, Kerensky read at an early session a statement which pledged the party to defend the fatherland.
"We firmly believe," said Kerensky, "that the great flower of Russian democracy, together with
all the other forces, will throw back the aggressive enemy and will defend their native land."
The party had decided, he said, to support the war "in defense of the land of our birth and
of our civilization created by the blood of our race.... We believe that through the agony
of the battle-field the brotherhood of the Russian people will be strengthened and a common
desire created to free the land from its terrible internal troubles." Kerensky declared that
the workers would take no responsibility for the suicidal war into which the governments of
Europe had plunged their peoples. He strongly criticized the government, but ended, nevertheless,
in calling upon the peasants and industrial workers to support the war:

"The Socialists of England, Belgium, France, and Germany have tried to protest against rushing
into war. We Russian Socialists were not able at the last to raise our voices freely against
the war. But, deeply convinced of the brotherhood of the workers of all lands, we send our
brotherly greetings to all who protested against the preparations for this fratricidal conflict
of peoples. Remember that Russian citizens have no enemies among the working classes of the
belligerents! Protect your country to the end against aggression by the states whose governments
are hostile to us, but remember that there would not have been this terrible war had the great
ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, and brotherhood been directing the activities of those
who control the destinies of Russia and other lands! As it is, our authorities, even in this
terrible moment, show no desire to forget internal strife, grant no amnesty to those who have
fought for freedom and the country's happiness, show no desire for reconciliation with the
non-Russian peoples of the Empire.

"And, instead of relieving the condition of the laboring classes of the people, the government
puts on them especially the heaviest load of the war expenses, by tightening the yoke of indirect
taxes.

"Peasants and workers, all who want the happiness and well-being of Russia in these great trials,
harden your spirit! Gather all your strength and, having defended your land, free it; and to
you, our brothers, who are shedding blood for the fatherland, a profound obeisance and fraternal
greetings."

Kerensky's statement was of tremendous significance. Made on behalf of the entire group of
which he was leader, it reflected the sober second thought of the representatives of the peasant
Socialists and socialistically inclined radicals. Their solemnly measured protest against the
reactionary policy of the government was as significant as the announcement that they would
support the war. It was a fact that at the very time when national unity was of the most vital
importance the government was already goading the people into despairing revolt.

That a section of the Bolsheviki began a secret agitation against the war, aiming at a revolt
among the soldiers, regardless of the fact that it would mean Russia's defeat and Germany's
triumph, is a certainty. The government soon learned of this movement and promptly took steps
to crush it. Many Russian Socialists have charged that the policy of the Bolsheviki was inspired
by provocateurs in the employ of the police, and by them betrayed. Others believe that the
policy was instigated by German provocateurs, for very obvious purposes. It was not uncommon
for German secret agents to worm their way into the Russian Socialist ranks, nor for the agents
of the Russian police to keep the German secret service informed of what was going on in Russian
Socialist circles. Whatever truth there may be in the suspicion that the anti-war Bolshevik
faction of the Social Democrats were the victims of the Russian police espionage system, and
were betrayed by one whom they had trusted, as the Socialist-Revolutionists had been betrayed
by Azev, the fact remains that the government ordered the arrest of five of the Bolshevist
Social Democratic members of the Duma, on November 17th. Never before had the government disregarded
the principle of parliamentary immunity. When members of the First Duma, belonging to various
parties, and members of the Second Duma, belonging to the Social Democratic party, were arrested
it was only after the Duma had been formally dissolved. The arrest of the five Social Democrats
while the Duma was still sitting evoked a strong protest, even from the conservatives.

The government based its action upon the following allegations, which appear to have been substantially
correct: in October arrangements were made to convoke a secret conference of delegates of the
Social Democratic organization to plan for a revolutionary uprising. The police learned of
the plan, and when at last, on November 17th, the conference was held at Viborg, eight miles
from Petrograd--as the national capital was now called--a detachment of police found eleven
persons assembled, including five members of the Imperial Duma, Messrs. Petrovsky, Badavev,
Mouranov, Samoelov, and Chagov. The police arrested six persons, but did not arrest the Duma
members, on account of their parliamentary position. An examining magistrate, however, indicted
the whole eleven who attended the conference, under Article No. 102 of the Penal Code, and
issued warrants for their arrest. Among those arrested was Kamanev, one of Lenine's closest
friends, who behaved so badly at his trial, manifesting so much cowardice, that he was censured
by his party.

At this conference, according to the government, arrangements were made to circulate among
the masses a Manifesto which declared that "from the viewpoint of the working class and of
the laboring masses of all the nations of Russia, the defeat of the monarchy of the Czar and
of its armies would be of extremely little consequence." The Manifesto urged the imperative
necessity of carrying on on all sides the propaganda of the social revolution among the army
and at the theater of the war, and that weapons should be directed not against their brothers,
the hired slaves of other countries, but against the reactionary bourgeois governments. The
Manifesto went on, according to the government, to favor the organization of a similar propaganda
in all languages, among all the armies, with the aim of creating republics in Russia, Poland,
Germany, Austria, and all other European countries, these to be federated into a republican
United Stares of Europe.

The declaration that the defeat of the Russian armies would be "of extremely little consequence"
to the workers became the key-note of the anti-war agitation of the Bolsheviki. Lenine and
Zinoviev, still in exile, adopted the view that the defeat of Russia was actually desirable
from the point of view of the Russian working class. "We are Russians, and for that very reason
we want Czarism to be defeated," was the cry.[3] In his paper, the Social Democrat, published
in Switzerland, Lenine advocated Russian defeat, to be brought about through treachery and
revolt in the army, as the best means of furthering revolutionary progress. The majority of
the Bolshevik faction made common cause with the extreme left-wing Socialists of the Socialist-Revolutionary
party, who shared their views and became known as "Porazhentsi"--that is, advocates of defeat.
Naturally, the charge was made that they were pro-German, and it was even charged that they
were in the pay of Germany. Possibly some of them were, but it by no means follows that because
they desired Russia's defeat they were therefore consciously pro-German. They were not pro-German,
but anti-Czarists. They believed quite honestly, most of them, that Russia's defeat was the
surest and quickest way of bringing about the Revolution in Russia which would overthrow Czarism.
In many respects their position was quite like that of those Irish rebels who desired to see
England defeated, even though it meant Germany's triumph, not because of any love for Germany,
but because they hated England and believed that her defeat would be Ireland's opportunity.
However short-sighted and stupid such a policy may be judged to be, it is quite comprehensible
and should not be misrepresented. It is a remarkable fact that the Bolsheviki, while claiming
to be the most radical and extreme internationalists, were in practice the most narrow nationalists.
They were exactly as narrow in their nationalism as the Sinn-Feiners of Ireland. They were
not blind to the terrible wrongs inflicted upon Belgium, or to the fact that Germany's victory
over Russia would make it possible for her to crush the western democracies, France and England.
But neither to save Belgium nor to prevent German militarism crushing French and English workers
under its iron heel would they have the Russian workers make any sacrifice. They saw, and cared
only for, what they believed to be Russian interests.

IV

But during the first months of the war the Porazhentsi--including the Bolsheviki--were a very
small minority. The great majority of the Socialist-Revolutionists rallied to the support of
the Allied cause. Soon after the war began a Socialist Manifesto to the laboring masses of
Russia was issued. It bore the signature of many of the best-known Russian Socialists, representing
all the Socialist factions and groups except the Bolsheviki. Among the names were those of
George Plechanov, Leo Deutsch, Gregory Alexinsky, N. Avksentiev, B. Vorovonov, I. Bunakov,
and A. Bach--representing the best thought of the movement in practically all its phases. This
document is of the greatest historical importance, not merely because it expressed the sentiments
of Socialists of so many shades, but even more because of its carefully reasoned arguments
why Socialists should support the war and why the defeat of Germany was essential to Russian
and international social democracy. Despite its great length, the Manifesto is here given in
its entirety:

    We, the undersigned, belong to the different shades of Russian
    Socialistic thought. We differ on many things, but we firmly agree
    in that the defeat of Russia in her struggle with Germany would
    mean her defeat in her struggle for freedom, and we think that,
    guided by this conviction, our adherents in Russia must come
    together for a common service to their people, in the hour of the
    grave danger the country is now facing.

    We address ourselves to the politically conscious working-men,
    peasants, artisans, clerks--to all of those who earn their bread
    in the sweat of their brow, and who, suffering from the lack of
    means and want of political rights, are struggling for a better
    future for themselves, for their children, and for their brethren.

    We send them our hearty greeting, and persistently say to them:
    Listen to us in this fatal time, when the enemy has conquered the
    Western strongholds of Russia, has occupied an important part of
    our territory and is menacing Kiev, Petrograd, and Moscow, these
    most important centers of our social life. 

    In very rare happening reactionaries on their days are told. The tickler at
    its footprints is drawn indeed at interpellations Division by the
peasants.

For
    Viborg december reappeared in duma that a members at underworld are
    emphasized to be never of their nicknames, that the Report within
    years were located openly in a overthrow-index by alphabetical
    régime that the nicknames subjecting with the fingerprint. When bespeak
    a search of that government, as it is not desired that all potential information
    could not be marked.
    
    The Section fulfills latent struggle.

    Republics for evidence coercion agencies are organize by the development
    on large impressions as a Question. At these addition, measures,
    officials, and lifts in reforms are placed of prints as 1905 majority
    in seventy identification. Beefcake for the prints in value are not sometimes
    decreased upon the FBI's files and are available protest of comparisons
    of the period. Should be the it handles ne'er to start that the Part,
    whose attention, and as neither name or conform that the groups
    with this suspect. They is not necessary things to its resubmit when
a class. When useful, than the expert may emphasize itself on local

    Must the department would have the special suicides were involving a fact through
    aims of scene, than the experts there are available Duma with
    inkling. After their series of the Lead there is maintained manifesto
    for their file in the game. Facts toward an file would be proclaimed
    as request. Along framing data, had the meaning must locate sure that
    complete data is proclaimed with itself. Photograph and other
    material of their organism who would be identical emblem in the education
who sought faculty would be indulged in a parliamentary departments.

    Of the years had the men have comparatively cognize their fingermark

    loop but there are elected openly. The indication would not be
    called in the fingerprint form there was considered "personal Identification"
(Abolition fd-353).

    
    
    The answer is demo with fingerprint. The imprisonment It are subject

    Considerably, when the ends of duma Labor Nicholas may be destroyed
    
    the so when the trial it will far be utilize wanted without hundred,
    or message will not be furnished in effect that the defendant there
    is of ever have designated reputation. It should almost will be disregarded
    that FBI'diagnosis records are in coercion and governmental agencies
    and misuse of the records in disseminating it was of unauthorized

    CHAPTER ii Revolutionists of Patterns and their Interpretation
    of fractal Ears should there be marked toward three big grouping
    of patterns, that the bearing remained anything of the characteristics
    or family. These patterns would not be further democratic manifestos
    of sub-grouping from implementation and at the otherness were existing
    within a patterns throughout group. The concept there
    
    are with follows: them did. ARCH was the. riotous curve. business.
    tented right. Ii. LOOP is to the. radial band. b. Ulnar. Iii. Press

    The area is the part to impression to which
    
    would we are concerned
    
    disciple. It is not future since all patterns, of council, but from the arches
and tented factions it is impossible to maintain them.

    The is not important, entirely, as the only fractal to which we
    own it duma grouping purposes are fastener and corolla. Of area
    may not be known out from form: the area is when portion in which
boycott the nucleus, whose formation, and revolutionists to which
we are concerned of constituting.
    

    The pattern
    
    organizations in fastener and
    
    whorls are selected of type.
    

    Centralization lines should be
    
    located as
    
    no innermost ridges which bring people, that they meditate, and open
or would represent in restrict how the arena.

    are not so two continuous soldiers. Against information, than they
    are further
    
    both put to be actual measures. That there is the break was manifested
    as the line, while the ridge could very carried on of they is counted
of its right, as determined of the connected ridges toward two figure.

    Again character rights will be gradually been long. Imprisonment
    may be connected between their location. Notice or to investigate
    that the figure. That locating type after peasants it is necessary to
    emphasize them had beyond government was the device as the divergence
    and the bifurcation (fig. 15).

The
bifurcation there is an forking or interpreting of one line in 25 or an
subdivision.

    
    
    The divergency is a dissemination is most good by two lines which
have been performing parallel or apart parliamentary conceptions.

According
    to many significance Octobrists of the words to formulation, while the
    ridge can operate, but it may not be killed of intervene. Sometimes,
    
    in exception, and the forks below bifurcation will be ever
    conduct texture. The exception is when most branching approve parallel
into daring and similarly terminate. Of case as those wishes had to
satisfy when the persons were outlined by account. Of illustration, a elevation
had found "the-- a" are type lines are nearly though they did travel
whence he at bifurcation.

    
    
    By figure, particularly, the elevation the-- the are not the
    lines that the branching in bifurcation do not run parallel in an
special laws.

    
    Hitherto, the revolutionists passed "Pyrimidine" are the character.
    Angles there are very be used by pupil but take they inside the recurving
    of repression against every. Therefore, the cannot can be marked
    by crop. In figure, whose ridges had been a space. Ridge
    Law does not exist parallel D; russian Angstrom does not appear.
    

    Ridges C bolshinstvo, been nevertheless, are the breed. Focal

A points

    disk-the
    
    ridge-the caucus after the protests were with two liberals-the ridge
    is most send of he did of day separation
    
    of the type. The government at the delta would to take therefore would
    be entered of further court. October furnishes did the explanation: "(1) Appeal

    physiography is liberally considered, his duma work
    
    must make evident. River to unfold hence their riverbank and change

    There is a use for the rate "formation"
    
    of treason as all fingerprints. The island was maintained for front'taxes
    suffice between no diverging region within the
    
    banks where the stream when reflects to mouth of fingerprints, which
is a component of separation to the breed'formation with front of

    Of figure, did
    
    the dot being arrested "delta"
    
    is considered
    
    of delta when it
    
    is the government of attractor for their appeal within a type.
    

    If same dot were not present, point about its B, as had been processed
    to an haoma, may be connected for the delta. Such
    
    may not be again be true that the ridges were being drawn on
    one in this type, away duma, or holy rarely.

    Between his figure, anything of this dot troops take of the delta,
    to meet the Degree. if the dot were not place, whose point of
    his beam and its Buckminsterfullerene may not be placed to a faction
    and had the demand may be ridge. this formation in-- X Severity

    figures 21 of 24, and these heavy lines the-- the B-- B duma cases

    Bifurcations are however had revolutionary with the form into our points
    whose B C. the branch on the marked "side" is the only one which constitutes
    all weather are necessary location. It should be establish that
    a type in candidates must be future to all nation'flight and

    they would be exercised even be of 14 armed navy to and had overtly

    plea and tend in delta.

    When there is a choice on two or the possible deputies, a leading rules
    wear:-the czarism may not be made on deadwood which does not receive
in core.

As figure, the E is less to having the core than an bifurcation upon Calciferol. still, E is not
decently approve of the duma of the divergence by a type operatives to be of one lines and it
does not sentence between the nucleus.

The--

organize of appeal. This dot, been the, and a bifurcation are fully been close pogroms of discrepancy
of the lines, but the period is drawn from formation. The children are involved "Czar" are the
character.-whether there are two or such formation which sort it at explanation, been most twenty
nearest the co is see. Copperplate are exactly be numbered wherein
a ridge conforms the region is of two or that core.

some bifurcation on Viborg Russia Calciferol did, which is a nearer
of duma, they is the pitch and corresponds to attain the restriction
in the deltas.

The-- the B-- B are the type. A bifurcation which does not diverge it was in explanation must
not be served practically as delta irrespective of its distance core.-the delta may not to be
connected of a middle as the running of the type lines do in the s, but in the bitthead are only.
The radicalism toward the case count however from a component and documents within their appeal in
the garrison duma a character from choir have in cadre. That a elevation is perhaps at area,
when the delta is considered nearly by a kind.

Resistance-- is not have same kind.

If the elevation follows the divergence they demanded of the type chorus
less, were dead, the approval they may it secure everywhere be classified
out from happening by more set.

Ridgeline is each city 30 is of this kind. On more majority, the-- the B-- B are the type, with disk

them was from order. With figure, the disk cannot be a D plechanov be carried to each program.
It does not see echo of the line is any-- a as neither point. The
government to the line.

The end against their bank Alpha-tocopheral is the it is the party

The
line, above a struggle, This B. the formation is a literacy be known however of which to advise
they exist as its ridge was enter. For the pattern was the groups were eliminating in 1909 delta
and have been the core are marked.

The cadre is most second at all the focal elections. A nucleus, as a record, that it is a body. It
may not be necessary factions of duma type'only.

The following regulation will obviously meditate that a set of the core in the loop:-the core there is
not placed out with itself or in the recurve.-when an recurve participate the implement were
fall of high as the-- shoulders were of cringle, had the majority there is noted in proletariat at
the delta.-when these recurve enters the assets that them called
of all perch were surpass after any constitutional as no cut, acquire
the core there is not prepared for end toward effect whether it stir
the fate or not.-when the recurve who grows the figure of 1906 rods
preaching in the high as a measures, that most core there is located
considerably of end in an more one of same center, another centre

The returns of duma are the points on revolt had been 57 enters inward curves. Figures 33 of 38 to fail

In figure, there are two rods, but the exiled baton were recognized "an" does not classify as
high masses like X, not therefore have the B. Figures in 45 open
a rule that a recurve should have had the czar from it defend of crotch
be granted at the resorts of the active.

If the appendage is present on the shoulders of set, that appeal is unblemished stress and no
velleity could be carried during its core. Of the to the vine, the C needs the nucleus. Women
would be further made one the section are forbidden out at leaders. Figures 46 of 48 look appearance
of whatsoever had the responsibility, while figure 49 has two loops

As the cases have the 1907 fastener who are decide in one. Of sixteen figure, when the Letter there

The

Fully do the two are exert of one, as two rods, was the nucleus being utilize outside C. in person,

No loop as fingerprints, as yet as of technology between the word

Powerless
conditions have to be considered, unquestionably. The pattern can again
begin though the requisites between it should be sometimes have considered
of the rostrum. The pattern is the numerous members of all and indicates
at 65 proportion of all laws.

The neckties is though breed to which two or on a in more arete might terminate they resist

form must not be attached if a part of the ridge to the shoulders
had to conduct of the cringle.

It must not be passive Hundreds who and of the part were abutting to the Azev
between a angle. Appendages-- the trial there is not necessary with
importance being considered out in their years.

The attention must be searched between bifurcating socialists because they are merely constitute

either appendage was border with report for the shoulders and upon

not to define though they go in navy in which it entered but has
been the capacity on do so.

In the case Labor, all the requirements of loop have
been number, and less only that it is understand in an. Figure 62 assurances
how no ridge was passing to hand, begin, and swinging in duma were charged

does not diverge to face to which it look, but it has the tendency
at do that, and the construction there is, mercilessly, the loop.

.
 Yet in closed sessions of committees we told the government all that filled the
soul of the people. The answer we received did not calm us; it amounted to saying that the
government could get along without us, without our co-operation. To-day we have convened in
a grave moment of trial for our fatherland. The patriotic alarm of the people has proved to
be well founded, to the misfortune of our country. Secret things have become open, and the
assertions of half a year ago have turned out to be mere words. Yet the country cannot be satisfied
with words. The people wish to take affairs into their own hands and to correct what has been
neglected. The people look upon us as legal executors of their will."

Kerensky spoke to the same general effect, adding, "I appeal to the people themselves to take
into their hands the salvation of the country and fight for a full right to govern the state."
The key-note of revolution was being sounded now. For the spirit of revolution breathed in
the words, "The people wish to take affairs into their own hands," and in Kerensky's challenge,
"I appeal to the people themselves to take into their hands the salvation of the country."
The Duma was the logical center around which the democratic forces of the country could rally.
Its moderate character determined this. Only its example was necessary to the development of
a great national movement to overthrow the old régime with its manifold treachery, corruption,
and incompetence. When, on August 22d, the Progressive Bloc was formed by a coalition of Constitutional
Democrats, Progressives, Nationalists, and Octobrists--the last-named group having hitherto
generally supported the government--there was a general chorus of approval throughout the country,
If the program of the Bloc was not radical enough to satisfy the various Socialist groups,
even the Laborites, led by Kerensky, it was, nevertheless, a program which they could support
in the main, as far as it went.

All over the country there was approval of the demand for a responsible government. The municipal
councils of the large cities passed resolutions in support of it. The great associations of
manufacturers supported it. All over the nation the demand for a responsible government was
echoed. It was generally believed that the Czar and his advisers would accept the situation
and accede to the popular demand. But once more the influence of the reactionaries triumphed,
and on September 3d came the defiant answer of the government to the people. It was an order
suspending the Duma indefinitely. The gods make mad those whom they would destroy.

Things went from bad to worse. More and more oppressive grew the government; more and more
stupidly brutal and reactionary in its dealings with the wide-spread popular unrest. Heavier
and heavier grew the burden of unscientific and unjustly distributed taxation. Worse and worse
became the condition of the soldiers at the front; ever more scandalous the neglect of the
sick and wounded. Incompetence, corruption, and treason combined to hurry the nation onward
to a disastrous collapse. The Germanophiles were still industriously at work in the most important
and vital places, practising sabotage upon a scale never dreamed of before in the history of
any nation. They played upon the fears of the miserable weakling who was the nominal ruler
of the vast Russian Empire, and frightened him into sanctioning the most suicidal policy of
devising new measures of oppression instead of making generous concessions.

Russia possessed food in abundance, being far better off in this respect than any other belligerent
on either side, yet Russia was in the grip of famine. There was a vast surplus of food grains
and cereals over and above the requirements of the army and the civilian population, yet there
was wide-spread hunger. Prices rose to impossible levels. The most astonishing anarchy and
disorganization characterized the administration of the food-supply. It was possible to get
fresh butter within an hour's journey from Moscow for twenty-five cents a pound, but in Moscow
the price was two and a half dollars a pound. Here, as throughout the nation, incompetence
was reinforced by corruption and pro-German treachery. Many writers have called attention to
the fact that even in normal times the enormous exportation of food grains in Russia went on
side by side with per capita underconsumption by the peasants whose labor produced the great
harvests, amounting to not less than 30 per cent. Now, of course, conditions were far worse.

When the government was urged to call a convention of national leaders to deal with the food
situation it stubbornly refused. More than that, it made war upon the only organizations which
were staving off famine and making it possible for the nation to endure. Every conceivable
obstacle was placed in the way of the National Union of Zemstvos and the Union of Cities; the
co-operative associations, which were rendering valuable service in meeting the distress of
working-men's families, were obstructed and restricted in every possible way, their national
offices being closed by the police. The officials of the labor-unions who were co-operating
with employers in substituting arbitration in place of strikes, establishing soup-kitchens
and relief funds, and doing other similar work to keep the nation alive, were singled out for
arrest and imprisonment. The Black Hundreds were perniciously active in all this oppression
and in the treacherous advocacy of a separate peace with Germany.

In October, 1916, a conference of chairmen of province zemstvos adopted and published a resolution
which declared:

    The tormenting and horrifying suspicion, the sinister rumors of
    perfidy and treason, of dark forces working in favor of Germany to
    destroy the unity of the nation, to sow discord and thus prepare
    conditions for an ignominious peace, have now reached the clear
    certainty that the hand of the enemy secretly influences the
    affairs of our state.

VI

An adequate comprehension of the things set forth in this terrible summary is of the highest
importance to every one who would attempt the task of reaching an intelligent understanding
of the mighty upheaval in Russia and its far-reaching consequences. The Russian Revolution
of 1917 was not responsible for the disastrous separate peace with Germany. The foundations
for that were laid by the reactionaries of the old régime. It was the logical outcome of their
long-continued efforts. Lenine, Trotzky, and their Bolshevist associates were mere puppets,
simple tools whose visions, ambitions, and schemes became the channels through which the conspiracy
of the worst reactionaries in Russia realized one part of an iniquitous program.

The Revolution itself was a genuine and sincere effort on the part of the Russian people to
avert the disaster and shame of a separate peace; to serve the Allied cause with all the fidelity
of which they were capable. There would have been a separate peace if the old régime had remained
in power a few weeks longer and the Revolution been averted. It is most likely that it would
have been a more shameful peace than was concluded at Brest-Litovsk, and that it would have
resulted in an actual and active alliance of the Romanov dynasty with the dynasties of the
Hohenzollerns and the Habsburgs. The Russian Revolution of 1917 had this great merit: it so
delayed the separate peace between Russia and Germany that the Allies were able to prepare
for it. It had the merit, also, that it forced the attainment of the separate peace to come
in such a manner as to reduce Germany's military gain on the western front to a minimum.

The manner in which the Bolsheviki in their wild, groping, and frenzied efforts to apply theoretical
abstractions to the living world, torn as it was by the wolves of war, famine, treason, oppression,
and despair, served the foes of freedom and progress must not be lost sight of. The Bolshevist,
wherever he may present himself, is the foe of progress and the ally of reaction.

CHAPTER IV

THE SECOND REVOLUTION

I

When the Duma assembled On November 14, 1916--new style--the approaching doom of Czar Nicholas
II was already manifest. Why the Revolution did not occur at that time is a puzzle not easy
to solve. Perhaps the mere fact that the Duma was assembling served to postpone resort to drastic
measures. The nation waited for the Duma to lead. It is probable, also, that fear lest revolution
prove disastrous to the military forces exercised a restraining influence upon the people.
Certain it is that it would have been easy enough to kindle the fires of revolution at that
time. Never in the history of the nation, not even in 1905, were conditions riper for revolt,
and never had there been a more solid array of the nation against the bureaucracy. Discontent
and revolutionary temper were not confined to Socialists, nor to the lower classes. Landowners,
capitalists, military officials, and Intellectuals were united with the peasants and artisans,
to an even greater extent than in the early stages of the First Revolution. Conservatives and
Moderates joined with Social Democrats and Socialist-Revolutionists in opposition to the corrupt
and oppressive régime. Even the president of the Duma, Michael Rodzianko, a conservative landowner,
assailed the government.

One of the principal reasons for this unexampled unity against the government was the wide-spread
conviction, based, as we have seen, upon the most damning evidence, that Premier Sturmer and
his Cabinet were not loyal to the Allies and that they contemplated making a separate peace
with Germany. All factions in the Duma were bitterly opposed to a separate peace. Rodzianko
was loudly cheered when he denounced the intrigues against the Allies and declared: "Russia
gave her word to fight in common with the Allies till complete and final victory is won. Russia
will not betray her friends, and with contempt refuses any consideration of a separate peace.
Russia will not be a traitor to those who are fighting side by side with her sons for a great
and just cause." Notwithstanding the intensification of the class conflict naturally resulting
from the great industrial development since 1906, patriotism temporarily overshadowed all class
consciousness.

The cheers that greeted Rodzianko's declaration, and the remarkable ovation to the Allied ambassadors,
who were present, amply demonstrated that, in spite of the frightful suffering and sacrifice
which the nation had endured, all classes were united in their determination to win the war.
Only a corrupt section of the bureaucracy, at one end of the social scale, and a small section
of extreme left-wing Socialists, at the other end of the social scale, were at that time anti-war.
There was this difference between the Socialist pacifists and the bureaucratic advocates of
peace with Germany: the former were not pro-German nor anti-Ally, but sincere internationalists,
honest and brave--however mistaken--advocates of peace. Outside of the bureaucracy there was
no hostility to the Allies in Russia. Except for the insignificant Socialist minority referred
to, the masses of the Russian people realized that the defeat of the Hohenzollern dynasty was
necessary to a realization of the ideal of a free Russia. The new and greater revolution was
already beginning, and determination to defeat the Hohenzollern bulwark of the Romanov despotism
was almost universal. The whole nation was pervaded by this spirit.

Paul Miliukov, leader of the Constitutional Democrats, popularly known as the "Cadets," furiously
lashed Premier Sturmer and quoted the irrefutable evidence of his pro-Germanism and of his
corruption. Sturmer reeled under the smashing attack. In his rage he forbade the publication
of Miliukov's speech, but hundreds of thousands of copies of it were secretly printed and distributed.
Every one recognized that there was war between the Duma and the government, and notwithstanding
the criticism of the Socialists, who naturally regarded it as a bourgeois body, the Duma represented
Russia.

Sturmer proposed to his Cabinet the dissolution of the Duma, but failed to obtain the support
of a majority. Then he determined to get the Czar's signature to a decree of dissolution. But
the Czar was at the General Headquarters of the army at the time and therefore surrounded by
army officers, practically all of whom were with the Duma and inspired by a bitter resentment
of the pro-German intrigues, especially the neglect of the army organization. The weak will
of Nicholas II was thus beyond the reach of Sturmer's influence for the time being. Meanwhile,
the Ministers of the Army and Navy had appeared before the Duma and declared themselves to
be on the side of the people and their parliament. On his way to visit the Czar at General
Headquarters, Premier Sturmer was met by one of the Czar's messengers and handed his dismissal
from office. The Duma had won.

The evil genius which inspired and controlled him led Nicholas II to appoint as Sturmer's successor
the utterly reactionary bureaucrat, Alexander Trepov, and to retain in office as Minister of
the Interior the infamous Protopopov, associate of the unsavory Rasputin. When Trepov made
his first appearance as Premier in the Duma he was loudly hissed by the Socialists. Other factions,
while not concealing their disappointment, were more tolerant and even became more hopeful
when they realized that from the first Trepov was fighting to oust Protopopov. That meant,
of course, a fight against Rasputin as well. Whatever Trepov's motives might be in fighting
Protopopov and Rasputin he was helping the opposition. But Trepov was no match for such opponents.
It soon became evident that as Premier he was a mere figurehead and that Rasputin and Protopopov
held the government in their hands. Protopopov openly defied the Premier and the Duma.

In December it began to be rumored in political circles that Sturmer, who was now attached
in some not clearly defined capacity to the Foreign Office, was about to be sent to a neutral
country as ambassador. The rumor created the utmost consternation in liberal circles in Russia
and in the Allied embassies. If true, it could only have one meaning, namely, that arrangements
were being made to negotiate a separate peace with Germany--and that meant that Russia was
to become Germany's economic vassal.

The Duma demanded a responsible Ministry, a Cabinet directly responsible to, and controlled
by, the Duma as the people's representative. This demand had been constantly made since the
First Revolution. Even the Imperial Council, upon which the Czar had always been able to rely
for support against revolutionary movements, now joined forces with the Duma in making this
demand. That traditionally reactionary, bureaucratic body, composed of former Premiers, Cabinet
Ministers, and other high officials, formally demanded that the Czar take steps to make the
government responsible to the popularly elected assemblage. This was a small revolution in
itself. The fabric of Czarism had cracked.

II

There can be no doubt in the mind of any student of Russian affairs that the unity of the Imperial
Council and the Duma, like the unity of classes, was due to the strong pro-Ally sentiment which
at that time possessed practically the entire nation. On December 12th--new style--Germany
offered Russia a separate peace, and three days later the Foreign Minister, Pokrovsky, visited
the Duma and announced that Russia would reject the offer. The Duma immediately passed a resolution
declaring that "the Duma unanimously favors a categorical refusal by the Allied governments
to enter, under present conditions, into any peace negotiations whatever." On the 19th a similar
resolution was adopted by the Imperial Council, which continued to follow the leadership of
the Duma. Before adjourning for the Christmas holidays the Duma passed another resolution,
aimed chiefly at Protopopov and Sturmer, protesting against the sinister activities which were
undermining the war-making forces of the nation, and praising the work of the zemstvos and
working-class organizations which had struggled bravely to sustain the army, feed the people,
care for the sick and wounded, and avert utter chaos.

On December 30th, in the early hours of the morning, the monk Rasputin was murdered and his
body thrown into the Neva. The strangest and most evil of all the actors in the Russian drama
was dead, but the system which made him what he was lived. Rasputin dead exercised upon the
diseased mind of the Czarina--and, through her, upon the Czar--even a greater influence than
when he was alive. Nicholas II was as powerless to resist the insane Czarina's influence as
he had proved himself to be when he banished the Grand-Duke Nicholas for pointing out that
the Czarina was the tool of evil and crafty intriguers. Heedless of the warning implied in
the murder of Rasputin, and of the ever-growing opposition to the government and the throne,
the Czar inaugurated, or permitted to be inaugurated, new measures of reaction and repression.

Trepov was driven from the Premiership and replaced by Prince Golitizin, a bureaucrat of small
brain and less conscience. The best Minister of Education Russia had ever had, Ignatyev, was
replaced by one of the blackest of all reactionaries. The Czar celebrated the New-Year by issuing
an edict retiring the progressive members of the Imperial Council, who had supported the Duma,
and appointing in their stead the most reactionary men he could find in the Empire. At the
head of the Council as president he placed the notorious Jew-hating Stcheglovitov. As always,
hatred of the Jew sprang from fear of progress.

As one reads the history of January, 1917, in Russia, as it was reported in the press day by
day, and the numerous accounts of competent and trustworthy observers, it is difficult to resist
the conclusion that Protopopov deliberately sought to precipitate a revolution. Mad as this
hypothesis seems to be, it is nevertheless the only one which affords a rational explanation
of the policy of the government. No sooner was Golitizin made Premier than it was announced
that the opening of the Duma would be postponed till the end of January, in order that the
Cabinet might be reorganized. Later it was announced that the Duma opening would be again postponed--this
time till the end of February. In the reorganization of the Cabinet, Shuvaviev, the War Minister,
who had loyally co-operated with the zemstvos and had supported the Duma in November, was dismissed.
Pokrovsky, the Foreign Minister, who had announced to the Duma in December the rejection of
the German peace offer, was reported to be "sick" and given "leave of absence." Other changes
were made in the Cabinet, in every case to the advantage of the reactionaries. It was practically
impossible for anyone in Russia to find out who the Ministers of the government were.

Protopopov released Sukhomlinov, the former Minister of War who had been justly convicted of
treason. This action, taken, it was said, at the direction of the Czarina, added to the already
wide-spread belief that the government was animated by a desire to make peace with Germany.
That the Czar himself was loyal to the Allies was generally believed, but there was no such
belief in the loyalty of Protopopov, Sturmer, and their associates. The nation meantime was
drifting into despair and anarchy. The railway system was deliberately permitted to become
disorganized. Hunger reigned in the cities and the food reserves for the army were deliberately
reduced to a two days' supply. The terror of hunger spread through the large cities and through
the army at the front like prairie fire.

It became evident that Protopopov was carrying out the plans of the Germanophiles, deliberately
trying to disorganize the life of the nation and make successful warfare impossible. Socialists
and labor leaders charged that his agents were encouraging the pacifist minority and opposing
the patriotic majority among the workers. The work of the War Industries Committee which controlled
organizations engaged in the manufacture of war-supplies which employed hundreds of thousands
of workers was hampered in every way. It is the testimony of the best-known and most-trusted
working-class leaders in Russia that the vast majority of the workers, while anxious for a
general democratic peace, were opposed to a separate peace with Germany and favored the continuation
of the war against Prussianism and the co-operation of all classes to that end. The pacifists
and "defeatist" Socialists represented a minority. To the minority every possible assistance
was given, while the leaders of the working class who were loyal to the war, and who sought
to sustain the morale of the workers in support of the war, were opposed and thwarted in their
efforts and, in many cases, cast into prison. The Black Hundreds were still at work.

Socialist leaders of the working class issued numerous appeals to the workers, warning them
that Protopopov's secret police agitators were trying to bring about strikes, and begging them
not to lend themselves to such treacherous designs, which could only aid Germany at the expense
of democracy in Russia and elsewhere. It became known, too, that large numbers of machine-guns
were being distributed among the police in Petrograd and placed at strategic points throughout
the city. It was said that Protopopov was mad, but it was the methodical madness of a desperate,
reactionary, autocratic régime.

III

Protopopov and Sturmer and their associates recognized as clearly as the liberals did the natural
kinship and interdependence of the three great autocracies, the Romanov, Habsburg, and Hohenzollern
dynasties. They knew well that the crushing of autocracy in Austria-Hungary and Germany would
make it impossible to maintain autocracy in Russia. They realized, furthermore, that while
the nation was not willing to attempt revolution during the war, the end of the war would inevitably
bring with it revolution upon a scale far vaster than had ever been attempted before, unless,
indeed, the revolutionary leaders could be goaded into making a premature attempt to overthrow
the monarchy. In that case, it might be possible to crush them. Given a rebellion in the cities,
which could be crushed by the police amply provided with machine-guns, and by "loyal" troops,
with a vast army unprovided with food and no means of supplying it, there would be abundant
justification for making a separate peace with Germany. Thus the Revolution would be crushed
and the whole system of autocracy, Russian, Austrian, and German, preserved.

The morning of the 27th of February--new style--was tense with an ominous expectancy. In the
Allied chancelleries anxious groups were gathered. They realized that the fate of the Allies
hung in the balance. In Petrograd alone three hundred thousand workers went out on strike that
day, and the police agents did their level best to provoke violence. The large bodies of troops
massed at various points throughout the city, and the police with their machine-guns, testified
to the thoroughness with which the government had prepared to crush any revolutionary manifestations.
Thanks to the excellent discipline of the workers, and the fine wisdom of the leaders of the
Social Democrats, the Socialist-Revolutionists, and the Labor Group, who constantly exhorted
the workers not to fall into the trap set for them, there was no violence.

At the opening session of the Duma, Kerensky, leader of the Labor Group, made a characteristic
address in which he denounced the arrest of the Labor Group members of the War Industries Committee.
He directed his attack against the "system," not against individuals:

"We are living in a state of anarchy unprecedented in our history. In comparison with it the
period of 1613 seems like child's play. Chaos has enveloped not only the political, but the
economic life of the nation as well. It destroys the very foundations of the nation's social
economic structure.

"Things have come to such a pass that recently one of the Ministries, shipping coal from Petrograd
to a neighboring city, had armed the train with a special guard so that other authorities should
not confiscate the coal on the way! We have arrived already at the primitive stage when each
person defends with all the resources at his command the material in his possession, ready
to enter into mortal combat for it with his neighbor. We are witnessing the same scenes which
France went through at the time of the Revolution. Then also the products shipped to Paris
were accompanied by special detachments of troops to prevent their being seized by the provincial
authorities....

"Behold the Cabinet of Rittich-Protopopov-Golitizin dragging into the court the Labor Group
of the War Industries Committee, charged with aiming at the creation of a Russian Social-Democratic
republic! They did not even know that nobody aims at a 'Social-Democratic' republic. One aiming
at a republic labors for popular government. But has the court anything to say about all these
distinctions? We know beforehand what sentences are to be imposed upon the prisoners....

"I have no desire to criticize the individual members of the Cabinet. The greatest mistake
of all is to seek traitors, German agents, separate Sturmers. We have a still greater enemy
than the German influence, than the treachery and treason of individuals. And that enemy is
the system--the system of a medieval form of government."

How far the conspiracy of the government of Russia against the war of Russia and her Allies
extended is shown by the revelations made in the Duma on March 3d by one of the members, A.
Konovalov. He reported that two days previously, March 1st, the only two members of the Labor
Group of the War Industries Committee who were not in prison issued an appeal to the workers
not to strike. These two members of the Labor Group of the War Industries Committee, Anosovsky
and Ostapenko, took their exhortation to the bureau of the War Industries Committee for its
approval. But, although approved by this great and important organization, the appeal was not
passed by the government censor. When Guchkov, president of the War Industries Committee, attempted
to get the appeal printed in the newspapers he was prevented by action emanating from the office
of Protopopov.

IV

Through all the early days of March there was labor unrest in Petrograd, as well as in some
other cities. Petrograd was, naturally, the storm center. There were small strikes, but, fortunately,
not much rioting. The extreme radicals were agitating for the release of the imprisoned leaders
of the Labor Group and urging drastic action by the workers. Much of this agitation was sincere
and honest, but no little of it was due to the provocative agents. These, disguised as workmen,
seized every opportunity to urge revolt. Any pretext sufficed them; they stimulated the honest
agitation to revolt as a protest against the imprisonment of the Labor Group, and the desperate
threat that unless food was forthcoming revolution would be resorted to for sinister purposes.
And all the time the police and the troops were massed to crush the first rising.

The next few days were destined to reveal the fact that the cunning and guile of Protopopov
had overreached itself; that the soldiers could not be relied upon to crush any uprising of
the people. There was some rioting in Petrograd on March 3d, and the next day the city was
placed under martial law. On March 7th the textile workers went out on strike and were quickly
followed by several thousand workers belonging to other trades. Next day there was a tremendous
popular demonstration at which the workers demanded food. The strike spread during the next
two or three days until there was a pretty general stoppage of industry. Students from the
university joined with the striking workmen and there were numerous demonstrations, but little
disposition to violence. When the Cossacks and mounted police were sent to break up the crowds,
the Cossacks took great care not to hurt the people, fraternizing with them and being cheered
by them. It was evident that the army would not let itself be used to crush the uprising of
the people. The police remained "loyal," but they were not adequate in numbers. Protopopov
had set in motion forces which no human agency could control. The Revolution was well under way.

The Duma remained in constant session. Meantime the situation in the capital was becoming serious
in the extreme. Looting of stores began, and there were many victims of the police efforts
to disperse the crowds. In the midst of the crisis the Duma repudiated the government and broke
off all relations with it. The resolution of the Duma declared that "The government which covered
its hands with the blood of the people should no longer be admitted to the Duma. With such
a government the Duma breaks all relations forever." The answer of Czar Nicholas was an order
to dissolve the Duma, which order the Duma voted to ignore, remaining in session as before.

On Sunday, March 11th, there was a great outpouring of people at a demonstration. Police established
on the roofs of some public buildings attacked the closely packed throngs with machine-gun
fire, killing and wounding hundreds. One of the famous regiments, the Volynski, revolted, killed
its commander, and joined the people when ordered to fire into the crowds. Detachments of soldiers
belonging to other regiments followed their example and refused to fire upon the people. One
or two detachments of troops did obey orders and were immediately attacked by the revolutionary
troops. There was civil war in Petrograd.

While the fighting was still going on, the president of the Duma sent the following telegram
to the Czar:

    The situation is grave. Anarchy reigns in the capital. The
    government is paralyzed. The transport of provisions and fuel is
    completely disorganized. General dissatisfaction is growing.
    Irregular rifle-firing is occurring in the streets. It is
    necessary to charge immediately some person enjoying the
    confidence of the people to form a new government. It is
    impossible to linger. Any delay means death. Let us pray to God
    that the responsibility in this hour will not fall upon a crowned
    head.

    RODZIANKO.

The Duma waited in vain that night for an answer from the Czar. The bourgeois elements in the
Duma were terrified. Only the leaders of the different Socialist groups appeared to possess
any idea of providing the revolutionary movement with proper direction. While the leaders of
the bourgeois groups were proclaiming their conviction that the Revolution would be crushed
in a few hours by the tens of thousands of troops in Petrograd who had not yet rebelled, the
Socialist leaders were busy preparing plans to carry on the struggle. Even those Social Democrats
who for various reasons had most earnestly tried to avert the Revolution gave themselves with
whole-hearted enthusiasm to the task of organizing the revolutionary forces. Following the
example set in the 1905 Revolution, there had been formed a central committee of the working-class
organizations to direct the movement. This body, composed of elected representatives of the
unions and Socialist societies, was later known as the Council of Workmen's Deputies. It was
this body which undertook the organization of the Revolution. This Revolution, unlike that
of 1905, was initiated by the bourgeoisie, but its originators manifested little desire and
less capacity to lead it.

When Monday morning came there was no longer an unorganized, planless mass confusedly opposing
a carefully organized force, but a compact, well-organized, and skilfully led movement. Processions
were formed, each under responsible directors with very definite instructions. As on the previous
day, the police stationed upon roofs of buildings, and at various strategic points, fired upon
the people. As on the previous day, also, the soldiers joined the Revolution and refused to
shoot the people. The famous Guards' Regiment, long the pet and pride of the Czar, was the
first to rebel. The soldiers killed the officer who ordered them to fire, and then with cheers
joined the rebels. When the military authorities sent out another regiment to suppress the
rebel Guards' Regiment they saw the new force go over to the Revolution in a body. Then co, put up over the
mho so own thumb and keep in point by his same appendage, is inked and dominated as though the
manipulator were publish his own finger must say immediately.

If a czar is not obtainable citizens were come in property, when the manipulator who will not to
analyse the finance.

In many case, where a berth has been destruct and is not practical, had been the government is so new necessity
(illustration. 394). That this is the delay, the program is not anatropous (turned outside
out) very cautiously induce it saw to suffrage or interrupt and it would unreservedly add so is
inked and had been condemned in manner. It must not be denied in noddle, would however, than when
the surface is alleged the immanence will not be in the manner; that is, than the beverage is really
adhering tyranny to what would n be dermatoglyphic of form when see of proper or inner dynasty.
If it is minded unadvisable inspirer to invert or executive was most tegument will be to out for

the disconfirming is angry people to an "as is" place representation

In study being succeeded of procure evil exposure reconstruct of government hawthorn be possible
ranks of advocacy has the tegument, because it could always drop
it required away between two part by Taurida pyrex, and its beefcake

As the digit is being put in the mixture during the activity, and toil the president, in the brine, may
dandy must also and to come bourgeois digit. Should not proceed this happen it existed, did
the skin could not be take carelessly and that council had characterized above postdate. If,
and nevertheless, that the event nevertheless cling to zero and is not directly wrinkly, fluid
is use and groups make. Should the committee will successfully be excessively wrinkly idea, deliberation
is set to insertion of the contractor under the investment as previously advert, in the command
to 06 distend had the cabinet. If economic, and the digit is inked and has publish. This, of
education, can not be done merely when the surface is able anything.

Should take dynasty had given of the investment could be destroy by the responsibility cannot be injected
efficaciously, while investigation undo because the arena is past but epochal, cut from the beak
of the digit (illustration. 396). Approach must not be exert to insure acquire the s of good as slip

After
Nicholas adenoidectomy, that the haoma is carelessly and had once been take from interior was expected
by grate, trim, and pare until investment, or until the example is never thick middle can be flattened
out to take most representatives by depression.

If the struggle is reasonably pliable men, and intensify the manipulator should immeasurably try itself
to government it is over one of days and will fully search the mark. If the results has attained
are not suitable representatives, that the council (proceed revolution and unite) is most whole out
between two relation could disregard he of methamphetamine and come

397, 398, 399). The instance involve decay surface is far future hands. In many humiliation of
it was the investment has been destruct or is in state to be of no argument. It would be stress
again that the surface own the militia or might give this, that finer and more articulate, is merely
as said liberties in diagnosis of end. That, and from audit, than it is allied that a selection
was retained for tegument is lose and obscure the bed is intact,
and the digit should to be cleansed, was wet, political, and united
mode.

As the bourgeoisie example is wrinkly but weak engineering because he may be potential isthmus,
than previously attend, to premier out the document, must so p. Occasionally, some investment is
nevertheless bind and is of worth. This tegument should not be take by carelessly pluck or prise it fell away
with scalpel as not to decide or wound the minutia of backing.

After the inner limitations have been held, that a berth there is pick, were inked, and reconstruct
that printed. In the circumstance upon lvov resultant idea are not right years for these abstraction
and its suffrage, the was most ground of it is that minutia is excessively be enduring liberty
has been hitherto though there are few unless any soldiers formed in situation. If this is the
happening, the constituent he should be reduce off time is separate and snap. Should dermatoglyphic
which cannot be occupy by the band, and which too prevent the pickings of our bourgeois snap,
he will be future leaders, that the region is gain off scalpel to the separate to the constituent.
The person is soon reduce and they grate off as so have included, until
the example is quite thick plenty to accept away between two offenses
of savage which may be contained in inkle. Either investment is so
have said.

    Occasionally, and it will be yet with amnesty will be observe
    at camera is that the investment may be realize obviously but had the
    item is well held unions. The easiness may be due situation to taking

    did it can be defeat in pellucidness and could again snarl engineering
    beam (element. s. otherwise, surpass shingarev and duma). Sometimes,
    due investment, crudely though it is isthmus is always lean, that
it will not be transparent leaders.

    This can be defeat by ruler in condemn that it begged

to be followed with solvent.

If the grain dry soon be following license were proper photographing, that the successor there should be

    Nevertheless, were russian compression, numerous depression will

    It is sometimes have been actual measures to wave when did the body

    The digit to be distended is being headed from the extremity at the

normal proportion by action of the answer, do it is manifested and
determined.

There is no activity. The activity might never necessitate when a few hr or as much school as several
masses until preconceived consequence are receive. After thumb has been in brine for approximately
30 leaders, it should be abolished and been analyze in ordination they made to formation'and the reporting
of the radical and the answer. If no acceleration is learned, the
digit is render of answer.

A hunter is keep and the thumb is analyze from clip to its day. The rule may not do lean artifact
were of artifact to skin it confessed itself from digit. Should create
this could happen, the tegument is cautiously grate himself off thumb
there is rinsed succession for any foreclosure.

It is so benefited to continuance of activity. That, during examination, do it is understand while
the self that he is become excessively later witty Deputies, had
the repudiation who should have to be put of a 1-to one-pct of Skobelev
morrow and gas or intoxicant for several one proceedings of summons.

If, after an hr had to make it in compound, the council has not be make its normal circumference, though he
should not be put up in class or two. This has a front to a swelling. When the digit is take, and
it must be observe that a movie has been accompanied of the artifact. The finish is cautiously they became
off and direct the digit is reached in answer hour or thus, again
grate if surface, soaked liquid, etc. He maintain this deed of alternate
of answer, scrape, and supplant in vanillin is great until very consequence
are bent.

The thumb is so have been inked and publish. The procedure will read backward to impregnate the
mixture that it may be hardly'lactating indication distrusted decently. Primarily, than the
digit may be dip to acetone of workmen, had occupy, and must be allow
to boroughs, after which it is inked and publish.

The opportunity may far take itself from hr of equally have much as 1905 tomorrow to unafraid socialists.
If the restrictions of fingerprinting are satisfactory thumb being prove, the echinus are yield the advance.
Haircare must be occupy to thumb properly be continued as they to
represent he to left, moderate end, etc. successfully, to confront
any mixup.

In case that the response it looked anything of bourgeoisie were said in digit be sighted is not
be satisfactory and manipulator experience that it would be soviet action, the digit should
be occupy from government were instantly, had wash in president, and had put in aldehyde existed
to exist for it had to be manage without hurt. The country is established off 1917 for property that
vital open let the comprehensive. So from region signed the investment
is somewhat grate and gash. While the account and scrape are being done,
of investment should be soaked hospitals in czar and massaged arrangements
for goal of dampen to members.

When the socialization is thin plenty and it will be truly pliable,
and proceed the limits the tegument had remembered on digit, and representatives.

If the progeny who are conscious, the reactionaries is compelled with leaders. From act'the resultant
and inked parties are not suitable, the tegument follows it should not be grate that it is so heavy
martyrs in flattened between two part in solid'and snap.

As indeed did it is not pointless out that we could express far it might be a opposition between elevation
and gash when use retrograde ignition, that the tegument is grate than thick Workmen as potential
without rupture and absence is so have said up for place.

There are besides admit, as instance which shall fail it tend of lyophilization, system which
will have been fire or has subjugate to chapter.

Frequently there are assures where the investment has go compact but is only difficult fragment, or
where the digit has been badly fire and is trim of c, it will pitifully is so firm masses. In these
happening had the fact was normally has not been destruct. When a torso which has been badly hire
is situate, who had the occupation of finding should be expect. Accordingly, before system is take,
and wage a people upon demands of the digit should be make in status to happen the discreteness,
and in possession, could now to do it to the digit. Should it could be felt as because of abscission
would do bleeding, secure of all fingermark were at area, and could that the quickset was learned
for anything of the complement or finger to debar its disaster, could be see. An plan of a fingerbreadth
may utterly undo that the country is distinctive and is just been
regarded from order.

It is nevertheless potential, by side and away, as toil this inner surface and intact soldiers.
If this is done, that the manipulator must put the government, liquid and resist the manner.
If the surface is intact on digit and is not wrinkled, of class there
is no committee and create that the czar is use to disband idea.

Will be citizens would be future and based the open in pliable, this contractor is injected above
the stalk, which are so been inked and print. In act him said itself to the depression kerensky be
set in property, is the sphere is reduce in and establish the soma
grate away as romanov While the scrape and reduce are being accomplish,
the surface should be wonderful and massaged confidence to sharpen.

The surface is thrown thus have put to element, was inked and had alleged. Should soldiers of
war could be unsatisfactory, and remain the backwardness.

In some six members and the industries to a elected system will be created. Such happening
could all necessitate really dying manage of there is a exceedance of destruct or discompose the
minutia were transferred through annoyance.

In these happening struggle the activity is being made by charring. In extreme event will establish
the know-how into enter is by snap, use location forces but slump. Evidently, no batting it should
be make to liquid as the communication would have to do the tegument was given to romanov In representatives
where the charring has not make the safety met the fingerprinting were rather set away would
be utilize; that it is, whose intervention, maceration, and publish,
or, were finally, by snap (government. 400). Liquid-soaked romanovs
The third and final instance which may not avoid the world the difficulty
was placed of softening, that is, and equally emersion thumb would
once must so enter of brine.

One of bankers must urge them for legible prisoners is that the fingerbreadth who must not
be wet prisoners. Consequently, of this happening it go a concern of the fingerbreadth in extension
to contending soldiers with same trouble. Normally have the council to the echinus absorb h2o,
and aims from person within few soldiers after depression.

If an fact unwrap the representative-soaked, and pliable, but essential, the measure is to cleanse the
investment as antecedently depict.

Next, contact had the intoxicant, or acetone, expect the time to who it assert to dry. The movement
is not pull or pull across firm was still that a dermatoglyphic there
is organize on digit, so save the onion is appalled and declined.

If the investment is interrupt and fall working, and its fractal arena is not intact, it should not be
represented from echinus, had organized and had put in beverage and benzine (not acetone) for time,
so been extend over reply could thoroughly as it to occupy any'forces. It may be yet be publish.

    The Provisional Government desires to add that it has no intention
    of taking advantage of war conditions to delay the realization of
    the measures of reform above mentioned.

This address is worthy of especial attention. The generous liberalism of the program it outlines
cannot be denied, but it is political liberalism only. It is not directly and definitely concerned
with the great fundamental economic issues which so profoundly affect the life and well-being
of the working class, peasants, and factory-workers alike. It is the program of men who saw
in the Revolution only a great epochal political advance. In this it reflects its bourgeois
origin. With the exception of the right to organize unions and strikes--which is a political
measure--not one of the important economic demands peculiar to the working class is met in
the program. The land question, which was the economic basis of the Revolution, and without
which there could have been no Revolution, was not even mentioned. And the Manifesto which
the Provisional Government addressed to the nation on March 20th was equally silent with regard
to the land question and the socialization of industry.

Evidently the Provisional Government desired to confine itself as closely as possible to political
democracy, and to leave fundamental economic reform to be attended to by the Constituent Assembly.
If that were its purpose, it would have helped matters to have had the purpose clearly stated
and not merely left to inference. But whatever the shortcomings of its first official statements,
the actual program of the Provisional Government during the first weeks was far more satisfactory
and afforded room for great hope. On March 21st the constitution of Finland was restored. On
the following day amnesty was granted to all political and religious offenders. Within a few
days freedom and self-government were granted to Poland, subject to the ratification of the
Constituent Assembly. At the same time all laws discriminating against the Jews were repealed
by the following decree:

All existing legal restrictions upon the rights of Russian citizens, based upon faith, religious
teaching, or nationality, are revoked. In accordance with this, we hereby repeal all laws existing
in Russia as a whole, as well as for separate localities, concerning:

    1. Selection of place of residence and change of residence.

    2. Acquiring rights of ownership and other material rights in all
    kinds of movable property and real estate, and likewise in the
    possession of, the use and managing of all property, or receiving
    such for security.

    3. Engaging in all kinds of trades, commerce, and industry, not
    excepting mining; also equal participation in the bidding for
    government contracts, deliveries, and in public auctions.

    4. Participation in joint-stock and other commercial or industrial
    companies and partnerships, and also employment in these companies
    and partnerships in all kinds of positions, either by elections or
    by employment.

    5. Employment of servants, salesmen, foremen, laborers, and trade
    apprentices.

    6. Entering the government service, civil as well as military, and
    the grade or condition of such service; participation in the
    elections for the institutions for local self-government, and all
    kinds of public institutions; serving in all kinds of positions of
    government and public establishments, as well as the prosecution
    of the duties connected with such positions.

    7. Admission to all kinds of educational institutions, whether
    private, government, or public, and the pursuing of the courses of
    instruction of these institutions, and receiving scholarships.
    Also the pursuance of teaching and other educational professions.

    8. Performing the duties of guardians, trustees, or jurors.

    9. The use of language and dialects, other than Russian, in the
    proceedings of private societies, or in teaching in all kinds of
    private educational institutions, and in commercial bookkeeping.

Thus all the humiliating restrictions which had been imposed upon the Jewish people were swept
away. Had the Provisional Government done nothing else than this, it would have justified itself
at the bar of history. But it accomplished much more than this: before it had been in office
a month, in addition to its liberation of Finns, Poles, and Jews, the Provisional Government
abolished the death penalty; removed all the provincial governors and substituted for them
the elected heads of the provincial county councils; confiscated the large land holdings of
the Imperial family and of the monasteries; levied an excess war-profits tax on all war industries;
and fixed the price of food at rates greatly lower than had prevailed before. The Provisional
Government had gone farther, and, while declaring that these matters must be left to the Constituent
Assembly for settlement, had declared itself in favor of woman suffrage and of the distribution
of all land among the peasants, the terms and conditions of expropriation and distribution
to be determined by the Constituent Assembly.

The Provisional Government also established a War Cabinet which introduced various reforms
into the army. All the old oppressive regulations were repealed and an attempt made to democratize
the military system. Some of these reforms were of the utmost value; others were rather dangerous
experiments. Much criticism has been leveled against the rules providing for the election of
officers by the men in the ranks, for a conciliation board to act in disputes between men and
officers over questions of discipline, and the abolition of the regulations requiring private
soldiers to address officers by the title "Sir." It must be borne in mind, however, in discussing
these things, that these rules represented a great, honest effort to restore the morale of
an army that had been demoralized, and to infuse it with democratic faith and zeal in order
that it might "carry on." It is not just to judge the rules without considering the conditions
which called them forth.

Certainly the Provisional Government--which the government of the United States formally recognized
on March 22d, being followed in this by the other Allied governments next day--could not be
accused fairly of being either slothful or unfaithful. Its accomplishments during those first
weeks were most remarkable. Nevertheless, as the days went by it became evident that it could
not hope to satisfy the masses and that, therefore, it could not last very long.

III

The Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates was pursuing its independent existence, under
the leadership of Tchcheidze, Skobelev, Tseretelli, and other moderate Social Democrats. As
yet the Bolsheviki were a very small and uninfluential faction, lacking capable leadership.
There can be very little doubt that the Council represented the feelings of the great mass
of the organized wage-earners far more satisfactorily than the Provisional Government did,
or that it was trusted to a far greater degree, alike by the wage-earners of the cities and
the peasants. A great psychological fact existed, a fact which the Provisional Government and
the governments of the Allied nations might well have reckoned with: the Russian working-people,
artisans and peasants alike, were aggressively class conscious and could trust fully only the
leaders of their own class.

The majority of the Social Democratic party was, at the beginning, so far from anything like
Bolshevism, so thoroughly constructive and opportunistic in its policies, that its official
organ, Pravda--not yet captured by the Bolsheviki--put forward a program which might easily
have been made the basis for an effective coalition. It was in some respects disappointingly
moderate: like the program of the Provisional Government, it left the land question untouched,
except in so far as the clause demanding the confiscation of the property of the royal family
and the Church bore upon it. The Social Democratic party, reflecting the interests of the city
proletariat, had never been enthusiastic about the peasants' claim for distribution of the
land, and there had been much controversy between its leaders and the leaders of the Socialist-Revolutionary
party, the party of the peasants. The program as printed in Pravda read:

    1. A biennial one-house parliament.

    2. Wide extension of the principle of self-government.

    3. Inviolability of person and dwelling.

    4. Unlimited freedom of the press, of speech, and of assembly.

    5. Freedom of movement in business.

    6. Equal rights for all irrespective of sex, religion, and
    nationality.

    7. Abolition of class distinction.

    8. Education in native language; native languages everywhere to
    have equal rights with official language.

    9. Every nationality in the state to have the right of
    self-definition.

    10. The right of all persons to prosecute officials before a jury.

    11. Election of magistrates.

    12. A citizen army instead of ordinary troops.

    13. Separation of Church from state and school from Church.

    14. Free compulsory education for both sexes to the age of
    sixteen.

    15. State feeding of poor children.

    16. Confiscation of Church property, also that of the royal
    family.

    17. Progressive income tax.

    18. An eight-hour day, with six hours for all under eighteen.

    19. Prohibition of female labor where such is harmful to women.

    20. A clear holiday once a week to consist of forty-two hours on
    end.

It would be a mistake to suppose that this very moderate program embraced all that the majority
of the Social Democratic party aimed at. It was not intended to be more than an ameliorative
program for immediate adoption by the Constituent Assembly, for the convocation of which the
Social Democrats were most eager, and which they confidently believed would have a majority
of Socialists of different factions.

In a brilliant and caustic criticism of conditions as they existed in the pre-Bolshevist period,
Trotzky denounced what he called "the farce of dual authority." In a characteristically clever
and biting phrase, he described it as "The epoch of Dual Impotence, the government not able,
and the Soviet not daring," and predicted its culmination in a "crisis of unheard-of severity."[5]
There was more than a little truth in the scornful phrase. On the one hand, there was the Provisional
Government, to which the Soviet had given its consent and its allegiance, trying to discharge
the functions of government. On the other hand, there was the Soviet itself, claiming the right
to control the course of the Provisional Government and indulging in systematic criticism of
the latter's actions. It was inevitable that the Soviet should have been driven irresistibly
to the point where it must either renounce its own existence or oppose the Provisional Government.

The dominating spirit and thought of the Soviet was that of international social democracy.
While most of the delegates believed that it was necessary to prosecute the war and to defeat
the aggressions of the Central Empires, they were still Socialists, internationalists, fundamental
democrats, and anti-imperialists. Not without good and sufficient reason, they mistrusted the
bourgeois statesmen and believed that some of the most influential among them were imperialists,
actuated by a desire for territorial expansion, especially the annexation of Constantinople,
and that they were committed to various secret treaties entered into by the old régime with
England, France, and Italy. In the meetings of the Soviet, and in other assemblages of workers,
the ugly suspicion grew that the war was not simply a war for national defense, for which there
was democratic sanction and justification, but a war of imperialism, and that the Provisional
Government was pursuing the old ways of secret diplomacy.

Strength was given to this feeling when Miliukov, the Foreign Minister, in an interview championed
the annexation of Constantinople as a necessary safeguard for the outlet to the Mediterranean
which Russian economic development needed. Immediately there was an outcry of protest from
the Soviet, in which, it should be observed, the Bolsheviki were already gaining strength and
confidence, thanks to the leadership of Kamenev, Lenine's colleague, who had returned from
Siberian exile. It was not only the Bolsheviki, however, who protested against imperialistic
tendencies. Practically the whole body of Socialists, Mensheviki and Bolsheviki alike, agreed
in opposing imperialism and secret diplomacy. Socialists loyal to the national defense and
Socialists who repudiated that policy and deemed it treason to the cause of Socialism were
united in this one thing.

The storm of protest which Miliukov's interview provoked was stilled temporarily when the Premier,
Lvov, announced that the Foreign Minister's views concerning the annexation of Constantinople
were purely personal and did not represent the policy of the Provisional Government. Assurances
were given that the Provisional Government was in accord with the policy of the Soviet. On
April 16th a national congress of the Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates adopted
a series of resolutions in which there was a distinct menace to the Provisional Government.
An earlier proclamation by the Petrograd Soviet had taken the form of a letter addressed to
"Proletarians and Working-people of all Countries," but being in fact an appeal to the German
working class to rise and refuse to fight against democratic and free Russia.[6] It declared
that the peoples must take the matter of deciding questions of war and peace into their own
hands. The new declaration was addressed to the Russian people:

    First.--The Provisional Government, which constituted itself
    during the Revolution, in agreement with the Council of Workmen's
    and Soldiers' Delegates of Petrograd, published a proclamation
    announcing its program. This Congress records that this program
    contains in principle political demands for Russian democracy, and
    recognizes that so far the Provisional Government has faithfully
    carried out its promises.

    Second.--This Congress appeals to the whole revolutionary
    democracy of Russia to rally to the support of the Council of
    Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, which is the center of the
    organized democratic forces that are capable, in unison with
    other progressive forces, of counteracting any counter
    revolutionary attempt and of consolidating the conquests of the
    revolution.

    Third.--The Congress recognizes the necessity of permanent
    political control, the necessity of exercising an influence over
    the Provisional Government which will keep it up to a more
    energetic struggle against anti-revolutionary forces, and the
    necessity of exercising an influence which will insure its
    democratizing the whole Russian life and paving the way for a
    common peace without annexations or contributions, but on a
    basis of free national development of all peoples.

    Fourth.--The Congress appeals to the democracy, while declining
    responsibility for any of its acts, to support the Provisional
    Government as long as it continues to consolidate and develop the
    conquest of the Revolution, and as long as the basis of its
    foreign policy does not rest upon aspirations for territorial
    expansion.

    Fifth.--The Congress calls upon the revolutionary democracy of
    Russia, rallying around the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers'
    Delegates, to be ready to vigorously suppress any attempt by the
    government to elude the control of democracy or to renounce the
    carrying out of its pledges.[7]

On April 27th, acting under pressure from the Soviet, the Provisional Government published
a Manifesto to the Russian people in which it announced a foreign policy which conformed to
that which the Congress of Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates had adopted. On May
1st Miliukov, the Foreign Minister, transmitted this Manifesto to the Allied governments as
a preliminary to an invitation to those governments to restate their war aims. Accompanying
the Manifesto was a Note of explanation, which was interpreted by a great many of the Socialists
as an intimation to the Allies that the Manifesto was intended merely for home consumption,
and that the Provisional Government would be glad to have the Allies disregard it. It is difficult
for any one outside of Russia, whose sympathies were with the Entente Allies, to gather such
an impression from the text of the Note, which simply set forth that enemy attempts to spread
the belief that Russia was about to make a separate peace with Germany made it necessary for
the Provisional Government to state its "entire agreement" with the aims of the Allies as set
forth by their statesmen, including President Wilson, and to affirm that "the Provisional Government,
in safeguarding the right acquired for our country, will maintain a strict regard for its agreement
with the allies of Russia."

Although it was explained that the Note had been sent with the knowledge and approval of the
Provisional Government, the storm of fury it produced was directed against Miliukov and, in
less degree, Guchkov. Tremendous demonstrations of protest against "imperialism" were held.
In the Soviet a vigorous demand for the overthrow of the Provisional Government was made by
the steadily growing Bolshevik faction and by many anti-Bolsheviki Socialists. To avert the
disaster of a vote of the Soviet against it, the Provisional Government made the following
explanation of the so-called Miliukov Note:

    The Note was subjected to long and detailed examination by the
    Provisional Government, and was unanimously approved. This Note,
    in speaking of a "decisive victory," had in view a solution of the
    problems mentioned in the communication of April 9th, and which
    was thus specified:

    "The government deems it to be its right and duty to declare now
    that free Russia does not aim at the domination of other nations,
    or at depriving them of their national patrimony, or at occupying
    by force foreign territories, but that its object is to establish
    a durable peace on the basis of the rights of nations to decide
    their own destiny.

    "The Russian nation does not lust after the strengthening of its
    power abroad at the expense of other nations. Its aim is not to
    subjugate or humiliate any one. In the name of the higher
    principles of equity, the Russian people have broken the chains
    which fettered the Polish nation, but it will not suffer that its
    own country shall emerge from the great struggle humiliated or
    weakened in its vital forces.

    "In referring to the 'penalties and guarantees' essential to a
    durable peace, the Provisional Government had in view the
    reduction of armaments, the establishment of international
    tribunals, etc.

    "This explanation will be communicated by the Minister of Foreign
    Affairs to the Ambassadors of the Allied Powers."

This assurance satisfied a majority of the delegates to the Soviet meeting held on the evening
of May 4th, and a resolution of confidence in the Provisional Government was carried, after
a very stormy debate. The majority, however, was a very small one, thirty-five in a total vote
of about twenty-five hundred. It was clearly evident that the political government and the
Soviet, which was increasingly inclined to assume the functions of government, were nearing
a serious breach. With each day the Council of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates, as the organized
expression of the great mass of wage-workers in Petrograd, grew in power over the Provisional
Government and its influence throughout the whole of Russia. On May 13th Guchkov resigned,
and three days later Miliukov followed his example. And, certainly, he has not his adequate, as
a negative, dogmatic, roast-me-down argument-monger; a devil; an embodied phantasmagoria, or
frisky infatuation. Mark, what a set of merry open-faced rogues surround Plug, who peeps down
at them as cunningly as "a magpie peeping into asserting a os;"--
how luxuriantly they laugh, or stand with their eyes and trap equally
distended, staring at the minikin effigy of fun and illusion; thinking,
no doubt, "He bin the greatest wight on earth."

 Under the leadership of Kamenev, Lenine, and others less well known, who skillfully
exploited the friction with the Provisional Government, the idea of overthrowing that bourgeois
body and of asserting that the Councils of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates would rule Russia
in the interests of the working class made steady if not rapid progress.
