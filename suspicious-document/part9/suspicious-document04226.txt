"'Lahiri, you are hungry.' Babaji added, 'Close your eyes.'

"When I reopened them, the enchanting palace and its picturesque gardens had disappeared. My
own body and the forms of Babaji and the cluster of chelas were all now seated on the bare
ground at the exact site of the vanished palace, not far from the sunlit entrances of the rocky
grottos. I recalled that my guide had remarked that the palace would be dematerialized, its
captive atoms released into the thought-essence from which it had sprung. Although stunned,
I looked trustingly at my guru. I knew not what to expect next on this day of miracles.

"'The purpose for which the palace was created has now been served,' Babaji explained. He lifted
an earthen vessel from the ground. 'Put your hand there and receive whatever food you desire.'

"As soon as I touched the broad, empty bowl, it became heaped with hot butter-fried LUCHIS,
curry, and rare sweetmeats. I helped myself, observing that the vessel was ever-filled. At
the end of my meal I looked around for water. My guru pointed to the bowl before me. Lo!  the
food had vanished; in its place was water, clear as from a mountain stream.

"'Few mortals know that the kingdom of God includes the kingdom of mundane fulfillments,' Babaji
observed. 

Carare below appears to oppose, also beautiful river, whose golden sands serve curdled milk to
a gentle stream, deep and clear. And what of memories to see the mouth of the river! It was there
that Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, conquistador of the New Kingdom of Granada, entered in 1536, dominating
as supreme incredible difficulties and dangers, that history, to be fair, you should consider this
issue as the most heroic, the most extraordinary ever conquistador anyone has conducted and consummated.
If YÃ©lez territories Relief and sent to her beautiful Magdalena
quota in the waters of the rivers Carare and opposition in both browsers
and delicious, the highlands of Tunja and Pamplona contribute their
abundant river Sogamoso or Colorado, which flows near the new port
of Barrancabermeja.

Here, Magdalena highly enriched with the wealth of so beautiful rivers, making grandiose proportions
that make it impressive, while the beautiful islands rising here and there, one very large (the
Morales), give the landscape, beautifully lit, an incredible resemblance to the lower Danube, judging
from the part that I visited. Below the State of Antioquia Sogamoso contribute (in addition to
the Honey and Nare rivers) with the romantic and beautiful river of the Scimitar, which recalls the
eternal storms that reign over the hills minerals in a range of the same name that separates
the region of Antioquia those of SimitÃ­ and Majagual.

The rowers have a thousand extravagant concerns about the hidden river bed of gold dust and dark
and impenetrable woods, and have many legends, making the sign of the cross on the dangerous metal seekers
who, having gone into the course of River, have returned to look more in Mompos. The people of
San-Pablo, a village situated at a short distance from the confluence of the Scimitar, or are
liable to Mohan Huan, terrible god of the caves and the great wells of rivers, of the misdeeds committed
by the jaguars, snakes and the solid blacks to the detriment of the unwary prospectors. HOWEVER,
I must state that the Mohan such a character does not strike me as absurd as you might think, if you notice
that the bottom line is the Devil, but a devil poetic, highly romantic, and therefore superior, under
the artistic point of view and spiritual, the mundane and vulgar devil sends us believe the Holy
Mother Church.
 A sweet
new breath of divine hope will penetrate the arid hearts of worldly men. From your balanced
life, they will understand that liberation is dependent on inner, rather than outer, renunciations.'

"How remote seemed my family, the office, the world, as I listened to my guru in the high Himalayan
solitudes. Yet adamantine truth rang in his words; I submissively agreed to leave this blessed
haven of peace.  Babaji instructed me in the ancient rigid rules which govern the transmission
of the yogic art from guru to disciple.

"'Bestow the KRIYA key only on qualified chelas,' Babaji said. 'He who vows to sacrifice all
in the quest of the Divine is fit to unravel the final mysteries of life through the science
of meditation.'

"'Angelic guru, as you have already favored mankind by resurrecting the lost KRIYA art, will
you not increase that benefit by relaxing the strict requirements for discipleship?' I gazed
beseechingly at Babaji.  'I pray that you permit me to communicate KRIYA to all seekers, even
though at first they cannot vow themselves to complete inner renunciation. The tortured men
and women of the world, pursued by the threefold suffering, {FN34-7} need special encouragement.
They may never attempt the road to freedom if KRIYA initiation be withheld from them.'

"'Be it so. The divine wish has been expressed through you.' With these simple words, the merciful
guru banished the rigorous safeguards that for ages had hidden KRIYA from the world. 'Give
KRIYA freely to all who humbly ask for help.'

"After a silence, Babaji added, 'Repeat to each of your disciples this majestic promise from
the BHAGAVAD GITA: "SWALPAMASYA DHARMASYA, TRAYATA MAHATO BHOYAT"--"Even a little bit of the
practice of this religion will save you from dire fears and colossal sufferings."' {FN34-8}

"As I knelt the next morning at my guru's feet for his farewell blessing, he sensed my deep
reluctance to leave him.

"'There is no separation for us, my beloved child.' He touched my shoulder affectionately.
'Wherever you are, whenever you call me, I shall be with you instantly.'

"Consoled by his wondrous promise, and rich with the newly found gold of God-wisdom, I wended
my way down the mountain. At the office I was welcomed by my fellow employees, who for ten
days had thought me lost in the Himalayan jungles. In BogotÃ¡
steam we met people from very different. The captain was a brave Genoese, Republican, free, simple
and cordial, and passengers were not only Grenadines few, but British, French and German. The heat
was soon established, as always happens in every trip, and an Irishman of 62 years, as big as
a tower, happy as a boy, first-class drinker, as has been his duty to honor their nationality, and
mocking the Irish and frisky all (except those who are serious), a disorder brought on deck delicious.
Sang, danced solo, played violin and drums (I understand the tools are not bound by a close fraternity),
and finally to communicate all the good humor. A few moments later the jungle nearby repeated chorus
of fire singing all passengers (each tone of the podium) and the Marseillaise, the anthem sublime
war and freedom, and God Save English Queen's, and songs more or less popular in New Granada, Germany
and Ireland. An hour after the edges of civilization, and when all reposÃ¡bamos in our hammocks
in the midst of shadows and silence, a hymn completely different, wild and melancholy, full of mystery,
grandeur and harsh poetry, a sudden burst, sustained voices fifty gruff and powerful rhythmic,
in the midst of mature woodland to the beach nearby. Case, the tone, style and mystery of the song
came to contrast nicely with the hot tracks just before sunrise side of BogotÃ¡ steam. Although
the show I was unknown, we could not resist the temptation to watch
closely.

So I jumped out of my hammock, I invited two friends and I went ashore with the direction we
indicated the song itself, and a red light shining through the heavy
shadows of the forest. The beach was deserted and no one slept on
the roofs of fashionable barges moored to an anchor of iron and thick
trunks.

After walking for a distance of several hundred meters through the middle of the woods, find
an extremely interesting show. Under the canopy of a giant cedar in a clean and sand, there was
a fire fed with thick trunks, branches of conifers and large pieces
of amber, a junior, which is very abundant in these forests endless.

Flare was gorgeous, deliciously fragrant, and the trees cast shadows Hadan play with light in
an admirable manner. Around the campfire, they knelt in confusion
about fifty people - men and women, old and young, locals and bream
- all at once with a hoarse voice and rhythmic, but extremely expressive
accent, sang a funeral hymn!

... Novena was a neighbor who had died three days earlier and whose body was buried a short
distance. The piece was a set of prayers in verse and extravagant created and used by sailors always
around novena, and choir, so incomprehensible in language as vigorous in his intonation, was
composed of a type of quatrain verses six syllables . Three men first sang a verse, all responded with
the refrain, and then played another three women, and so on.

I confess that in this wild scene, but full of charm of faith and devotion, I found more and more
religious poetry in the songs of BogotÃ¡ steam. Tone was deep and dark, solemn, in spite of its
rustic harmony, and I was in this scene a great impression and teaching.

Poetry is undoubtedly the most sublime manifestations of the soul in its relations with God, man
and nature.

 Firmly anchored in the Spirit, again I assumed the manifold business
and family obligations of a householder."

Lahiri Mahasaya also related to Swami Kebalananda and Sri Yukteswar the story of another meeting
with Babaji, under circumstances which recalled the guru's promise: "I shall come whenever
you need me."

"The scene was a KUMBHA MELA at Allahabad," Lahiri Mahasaya told his disciples. "I had gone
there during a short vacation from my office duties. As I wandered amidst the throng of monks
and sadhus who had come from great distances to attend the holy festival, I noticed an ash-smeared
ascetic who was holding a begging bowl. The thought arose in my mind that the man was hypocritical,
wearing the outward symbols of renunciation without a corresponding inward grace.

"No sooner had I passed the ascetic than my astounded eye fell on Babaji. He was kneeling in
front of a matted-haired anchorite.

"'Guruji!' I hastened to his side. 'Sir, what are you doing here?'

"'I am washing the feet of this renunciate, and then I shall clean his cooking utensils.' Babaji
smiled at me like a little child; I knew he was intimating that he wanted me to criticize no
one, but to see the Lord as residing equally in all body-temples, whether of superior or inferior
men. The great guru added, 'By serving wise and ignorant sadhus, I am learning the greatest
of virtues, pleasing to God above all others-humility.'"

{FN34-1} Now a military sanatorium. By 1861 the British Government had already established
certain telegraphic communciations.

{FN34-4} The karmic law requires that every human wish find ultimate fulfillment. Desire is
thus the chain which binds man to the reincarnational wheel. The son traveler said goodbye
to his motherland. I understood it perfectly.

Leaving your homeland poses a whole, dramatic experience for the heart. It is a solemn, memorable
experience for the traveler's soul; a deep affliction of hope and
fear.

Leaving the sandy beach of his homeland, where the deep breaks the majestic Magdalena, his parting thought
was of an immense treasure. Thoughts of my father's grave, family traditions, ash Home. Sweet
memories, and the mad whims of young love. Friend's fortune, freedom, air, sky, thousands of vague
rumors and the confusion that follows. And all that lovely set of impressions and dreams, regrets
and memories, misfortunes and such; which makes up the Fatherland.
All of which was left behind and buried in a cemetary whose cover
was a city called Honda.

       

What did the future hold? The vague and unknown, the infinite and marvelous-all of which touches the
heart in his dreams of hope. And the doubt covered in shadow when the travelor says, "Who knows?"

Honda
is an old city; entirely Spanish in its construction-but looks so whimsical and colorful that it captures
the highest degree of romance.

The Magdalena River, the great artery of commerce in New Granada, suddenly lost its gentleness after
having been brought in some leagues in the direction of Southeast to west. It narrowed between the high
rocks of two parallel ridges and twisted northward between stony rapids crowned with foam.
It roared like the great bulk of a waterfall until it tired and rested a league below to gently lick
the wide Bodega beaches.

A plain stretched for four miles, interrupted by picturesque woods and
hills of luxurious vegetation.

It came from the ruined town of Mariquita (the tomb of Conqueror Quesada), at the foot of the
central cordillera of the Andes and ended on the left edge of Magdalena, overlooking the
rough rapids-referred to as the waterfall by the natives.

The exquisite Guali River, a sparkling blue torrent whose shore lined
rich woods, limited the plains to the north. It ran O to E to come
clean and give tribute to Magdelena, dividing into two parts of Honda
City. 400 meters above, a beautiful stream flows; cutting the main
harbor beach.

From an outside view, Honda seems to be an eastern
city or Moorish as the capiricious situation pars and with its heavy
masonry buildings. The contrast of colors, roofs, black or white walls,
extravagent ways and balconies and rooftops also procure this image.
And the tufts of tall coconut trees, swaying gently to entertain with
his shadow city, protect it against the rays of a scorching sun that
shines in the middle of a sky forever blue and transparent. {FN35-7} When John denied that he was Elias (Elijah), {FN35-8} he meant that in the
humble garb of John he came no longer in the outward elevation of Elijah the great guru. In
his former incarnation he had given the "mantle" of his glory and his spiritual wealth to his
disciple Elisha. "And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon
me. And he took the MANTLE of Elijah that fell from him." {FN35-9}

The roles became reversed, because Elijah-John was no longer needed to be the ostensible guru
of Elisha-Jesus, now perfected in divine realization.

When Christ was transfigured on the mountain {FN35-10} it was his guru Elias, with Moses, whom
he saw. Again, in his hour of extremity on the cross, Jesus cried out the divine name: "ELI,
ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?  that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? Some of
them that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias. . . . Let us
see whether Elias will come to save him." {FN35-11}

The eternal bond of guru and disciple that existed between John and Jesus was present also
for Babaji and Lahiri Mahasaya. With tender solicitude the deathless guru swam the Lethean
waters that swirled between the last two lives of his chela, and guided the successive steps
taken by the child and then by the man Lahiri Mahasaya. It was not until the disciple had reached
his thirty-third year that Babaji deemed the time to be ripe to openly reestablish the never-severed
link. Then, after their brief meeting near Ranikhet, the selfless master banished his dearly-beloved
disciple from the little mountain group, releasing him for an outward world mission. "My son,
I shall come whenever you need me." What mortal lover can bestow that infinite promise?

Unknown to society in general, a great spiritual renaissance began to flow from a remote corner
of Benares. Just as the fragrance of flowers cannot be suppressed, so Lahiri Mahasaya, quietly
living as an ideal householder, could not hide his innate glory. Slowly, from every part of
India, the devotee-bees sought the divine nectar of the liberated master.

The English office superintendent was one of the first to notice a strange transcendental change
in his employee, whom he endearingly called "Ecstatic Babu."

"Sir, you seem sad. What is the trouble?" Lahiri Mahasaya made this sympathetic inquiry one
morning to his employer.

"My wife in England is critically ill. I am torn by anxiety."

"I shall get you some word about her." Lahiri Mahasaya left the room and sat for a short time
in a secluded spot. On his return he smiled consolingly.

"Your wife is improving; she is now writing you a letter." The omniscient yogi quoted some
parts of the missive.

"Ecstatic Babu, I already know that you are no ordinary man. Yet I am unable to believe that,
at will, you can banish time and space!"

The promised letter finally arrived. The astounded superintendent found that it contained not
only the good news of his wife's recovery, but also the same phrases which, weeks earlier,
Lahiri Mahasaya had repeated.

The wife came to India some months later. She visited the office, where Lahiri Mahasaya was
quietly sitting at his desk. The woman approached him reverently.

"Sir," she said, "it was your form, haloed in glorious light, that I beheld months ago by my
sickbed in London. At that moment I was completely healed! Soon after, I was able to undertake
the long ocean voyage to India." Today, there is more than a place of travel which begins to rise again amid rubble, thanks
to the interior and agriculture of the great advantages offered by
the navigation of Magdalena.

I have never seen a city that is as well represented as in Honda's life. It holds in the power
of an exuberant nature, splendid, a lively trade and death which appears to be nested in the
solitude of the ruins blackened by time. Fighting against each other endlessly, there is no doubt who
who will be playing to win as it is to the previous, protected by the freedom and industry,
as they are representatives of progress, which is the synthesis of
life!

Honda City is the restraint or center of two entirely different regions: Southern and Eastern
regions of the upper Magdalena admirable, towards the north, the endless wilderness, the burning
deserts and the recurrent likeness of the lower Magdalena. Top of the most splendid region of southern
Colombia is found a boundlessly varied landscape of plains, hills, jungles, mountains, endless
contrasts in shapes, colors and resources of nature. Continuous are all the succession of valleys,
lakes, luxurious mountains. These elements are enriched by an active population both large and
very civilized. Having an advanced agriculture, this brings brings together trade, livestock, arts
and mining industries. Within all of this gorgeous region of the burning paradise of New Granada,
is a civilization developing an an active social life.

Honda which is below, follows the course of the Magdalena, the scene changes dramatically. The
river better reveals the wildness of the surrounding region. It is more inactive and the further
along deep into the channel it splits into many directions which sometimes widens as small inland
sea waters that hides among the foliage of the forest secular. Standing in its way are a
cluster of picturesque islands and later becomes more unpleasant by the abundance of poisonous
insects and alligators. In Ardentia the beaches were consumed by the sun and the absolute solitude
of the beaches twists and turn. The marshes and wild ravines sadness,reveals that humanity had yet
to have the courage to go into battle with the Empress of Nature called deserts! I followed the
stream of Magdalena, this is the region where I had no other choice
but to cross and give my farewell to the homeland.*** ***The Champagne
turned around, the beach paddles stirred the beat of the wild cries
the stream, and few minutes later, to turn its course for between
monstrous banks of Magdalena, lost sight of the last tufts of coconut
trees that indicated the site of the winery.

Man disappeared to give the field exclusively to the vegetation. Always huge, wide at first, loved
everywhere, presenting the most beautiful high cliffs that overlooked
the shore, or in the luxurious halls of vegetables that came to extend
their floating lace parasitic vines on the beach itself, to where
it leaves to bake in ignited sand beds, the fearsome and monstrous
crocodile, the terror of the inhabitants wave.

       

Entire forests contain earthly cedar with its dark shadow covering
a slope failures disrupted by the upheavals of nature, and groups
of towering palms are pavilions where flocks of parrots swinging gorgeously;
and on the cliff of red clay layers composed of mixed layers, rises
a group of giant guaduas (bamboo), which for a thousand thin woven
covered Bejuquillo flowers flexibly cast their feathers on the waves
of the river, and open for fans the wind, where a fairy forest has
drawn on the most whimsical green background arabesques and mosaics.

Everywhere luxury and lush vegetation, rich contrasts and variety of forms and colors in nature exist,
with complete absence of population and culture. If one still notes
the inflections in the field, is because they have not yet completed the
ramifications that two main mountain ranges of the Andes - Central
and Eastern - throw on the Magdalena different directions.

After the hills disappeared, the forests became the horizon, and
eyes of the traveler became tired and sad now sees nothing but endless
desert.

  As he was explaining the meaning of KUTASTHA CHAITANYA
or the Christ Consciousness in all vibratory creation, Lahiri Mahasaya suddenly gasped and
cried out:

"I am drowning in the bodies of many souls off the coast of Japan!"

The next morning the chelas read a newspaper account of the death of many people whose ship
had foundered the preceding day near Japan.

The distant disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya were often made aware of his enfolding presence. 

And at the foot of those huts that are under transition to a life that is closer to barbarism progress
still, stood the chimney, the pavilion and masts and picturesque sides Steam Bogota to protest against
barbarism, and prove that even in the midst of the desert and the sublime mystery of an imponderable
nature by force, the man is about to start universal sovereignty, making success all over
the strength of spirit on the power of matter.


"Lahiri Mahasaya's words were mild and healing, even when he was forced to speak openly of
a chela's faults," Sri Yukteswar once told me. He added ruefully, "No disciple ever fled from
our master's barbs." I could not help laughing, but I truthfully assured Sri Yukteswar that,
sharp or not, his every word was music to my ears.

Lahiri Mahasaya carefully graded KRIYA into four progressive initiations. {FN35-15} He bestowed
the three higher techniques only after the devotee had manifested definite spiritual progress.
One day a certain chela, convinced that his worth was not being duly evaluated, gave voice
to his discontent.

"Master," he said, "surely I am ready now for the second initiation." The sun burns like an ember, heat, 36 degrees is sufocante, and desolation
of nature begins. Nare is a district of population and look miserable unhealthy, and that except
two or three families, it contains but rowers and people of Indo-African race. HOWEVER, it is a very
important point for internal trade, for the State scale of Antioquia, and a nearby nice, fairly
flow is navigated by barges and canoes seven leagues above its mouth.

Nare was augmented in the number of passengers with a sturdy Scottish, mine operator, a dentist,
which inevitably turned out to be Yankee, and Antioquia that, as soon as it entered steamed,
promoted a raffle, and began his speculations. The Antioquia, descendants mostly of an expedition
of Jews from the time of Philip III, are the Israelites New Granada, in point of business and
travel, even on open and empty bottles are essentially British.

One mile down is the famous Angostura Nare, terror of the sailors, and out of it begins the region
of the gorgeous islands of vegetation, more and more numerous, because the Magdalena, widening
a lot about an area of ​​low-level flooding, endless as plain jungle diseminasus water in all
directions. For the rest, nature loses all their variety, - the vegetation, subject to floods,
appears skeleton, colorless and rough, and the hills out of sight entirely.


Among many saints who received KRIYA from Lahiri Mahasaya may be mentioned the illustrious
Swami Vhaskarananda Saraswati of Benares, and the Deogarh ascetic of high stature, Balananda
Brahmachari. For a time Lahiri Mahasaya served as private tutor to the son of Maharaja Iswari
Narayan Sinha Bahadur of Benares. Recognizing the master's spiritual attainment, the maharaja,
as well as his son, sought KRIYA initiation, as did the Maharaja Jotindra Mohan Thakur.

A number of Lahiri Mahasaya's disciples with influential worldly position were desirous of
expanding the KRIYA circle by publicity. The guru refused his permission. One chela, the royal
physician to the Lord of Benares, started an organized effort to spread the master's name as
"Kashi Baba" 

Such a profound impression the heart of a patriot experiences. Dreamer of progress, when for the first
time, he trusts like a traveler, to the second Divine Providence, to the invisible spirit of humanity,
transfused by mechanical power, to what is called steam.
