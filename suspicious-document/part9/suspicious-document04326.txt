At this place, while loitering to procure information and guides for their future journey to
Santa Cruz del Quiche, they got acquainted with Sr. Pedro Velasquez, of San Salvador, who describes
himself as a man of family and education, although a trader in indigo; and his intermediate
destination, prior to his return to the capital, happening also to be the same city, he kindly
proffered to the two Americans his superior knowledge of the country, or any other useful service
he could render them; and he was accordingly very gladly received as their friend and companion
on the way. It is from a copy of a manuscript journal of this gentleman, that the translator
has obtained the only information as yet brought to the United States concerning the remarkable
results of the exploring expedition which he will proceed to describe, or of the fate of Messrs.
Huertis and Hammond, its unfortunate originators and conductors, or of those extraordinary
living specimens of a sui generis race of beings, hitherto supposed to be either fabulous or
extinct, which are at once its melancholy trophies and its physiological attesters. And it
is from Senor Velasquez alone that the public can receive any further intelligence upon this
ardently interesting subject, beyond that which his manuscript imperfectly affords.

In order, however, to avoid an anticipatory trespass upon the natural sequence of the narrative,
it may be proper to state, that prior to his departure in their company from Coban, Senor Velasquez
had received from his fellow travellers no intimation whatever concerning the ulterior object
of their journey, and had neither seen nor heard of those volumes describing the stupendous
vestiges of ancient empire, in his native land, which had so strongly excited the emulous passion
of discovery in their minds. 

Therefore we learn of no further expedition in this portion of the nature until nearly a quattrocento
after; and, yet so, the one thought of direct away ships have particularly for the purpose.# 8. As it
become often the tide of discovery from Australia; for those who say of the ugly earth and poor
Dampier had elsewhere see would ne'er woolgather of the labour and cost of a seafaring to so
lively and sudden point as Australia look to be by the specification
in his authority

. And being, as it evidently appears, a man of unusual intelligence and scholastic
acquirements, he had doubtless felt, as he states, a profound but hopeless curiosity concerning
their origin and history. He had even seen and consecutively examined the numerous and ornate
monuments of Copan; but it was not until he had proceeded to the second stage of the journey
from Coban to Quiche, that he was shown the engravings in the first volume of Stevens's Central
America, in which they are so faithfully depicted. He recognized many of them as old acquaintances,
and still more as new ones, which had escaped his more cursory inspection; and in all he could
trace curious details which, on the spot, he regretted the want of time to examine. He, moreover,
knew the surly Don Gregorio, by whom Mr. Stevens had been treated so inhospitably, and several
other persons in the vicinity of the ruins whom he had named, and was delighted with the vraisemblance
of his descriptions. The Senor confesses that these circumstances inspired him with unlimited
confidence in that traveller's statements upon other subjects; and when Mr. Huertis read to
him the further account of the information given to Mr. Stevens by the jolly and merry, but
intelligent old Padre of Quiche, respecting other ruined cities beyond the Sierra Madre, and
especially of the living city of independent Candones, or unchristianized Indians, supposed
to have been seen from the lofty summit of that mountain range, and was told by Messrs. Huertis
and Hammond that the exploration of this city was the chief object of their perilous expedition,
the Senor adds, that his enthusiasm became enkindled to at least as high a fervor as theirs,
and that, "with more precipitancy than prudence, in a man of his maturer years and important
business pursuits, he resolved to unite in the enterprise, to aid the heroic young men with
his experience in travel and knowledge of the wild Indians of the region referred to, and to
see the end of the adventure, result as it may."

He was confirmed in this resolution by several concurring facts of which his companions were
now told for the first time. He intimately knew and had several times been the guest of the
worthy Cura of Quiche, from whom Mr. Stevens received assurances of the existence of the ruined
city of the ancient Aztecs, as well as the living city of the Candones, in the unsubjugated
territory beyond the mountains. And he was induced to yield credence to the Padre's confident
report of the latter, because his account of the former had already been verified, and become
a matter of fact and of record. He, Senor Velasquez, himself, during the preceding summer,
joined a party of several foreigners and natives in exploring an ancient ruined city, of prodigious
grandeur and extent, in the province of Vera Paz, but little more than 150 miles to the east
of Guatimala, (instead of nearly 200, as the Padre had supposed,) which far surpassed in magnificence
every other ruin, as yet discovered, either in Central America or Mexico. It lay overgrown
with huge timber in the midst of a dense forest, far remote from any settlement, and near the
crater of a long extinct volcano, on whose perpendicular walls, 300 or 400 feet high, were
aboriginal paintings of warlike and idolatrous processions, dances, and other ceremonies, exhibiting
like the architectural sculptures on the temples, a state of advancement in the arts incomparably
superior to all previous examples. And as the good Padre had proved veracious and accurate
on this matter, which he knew from personal observation, the Senor would not uncharitably doubt
his veracity on a subject in which he again professed to speak from the evidence of his own
eye-sight.

The party thus re-assured, and more exhilarated than ever with the prospect of success, proceeded
on their journey with renewed vigor. Although the Senor modestly abstains from any allusion
to the subject, in the MSS. which have reached us, it cannot be doubted that Messrs. Huertis
and Hammond considered him an invaluable accession to their party. He was a guide on whom they
could rely; he was acquainted with the dialects of many of the Indian tribes through which
they would have to pass; was familiar with the principal stages and villages on their route,
and knew both the places and persons from whence the best information, if any, concerning the
paramount object of their journey, could be obtained.

It appears, also, from an incidental remark in his journal, that Senor Velasquez would have
been at their right hand in a fight, in the event of any hostile obstruction on their way.
As a volunteer, he had held a command under Morazan, during the sanguinary conflicts of the
republic, and had been a soldier through several of the most arduous campaigns, in the fierce
struggle between the general and Carrera. He was thus, apparently, in all respects, precisely
such an auxiliary as they would have besought Providence to afford them, to accomplish the
hazardous enterprise they had so daringly projected and commenced.

Unfortunately for the public, the Senor's journal, fragmentary throughout, is especially meagre
concerning the incidents of travel between the capital of Vera Paz and Santa Cruz del Quiche.
At this period he appears to have left the task of recording them almost entirely to his two
friends, whose memoranda, in all probability, are forever lost. Some of those incidents appear,
even from his brief minutes of them, to have been of the most imminent and critical importance.
Thus under the date of February 2nd, 1849, he says, "on the bank of a branch of the Salamo,
attacked in the night by about thirty Indian robbers, several of whom had fire-arms. Sr. Hammond,
sitting within the light of the fire, was severely wounded through the left shoulder; they
had followed us from the hacienda, six leagues, passed us to the north and lay in ambush; killed
four, wounded three; of the rest saw no more; poor Juan, shot through the body, died this morning;
lost two mules."

After this, there is nothing written until the 16th, when they had arrived at a place called
San Jose, where he says, "Good beef and fowls; Sr. Huertis much better; Sr. Hammond very low
in intermittent fever; fresh mules and good ones." Next on the 5th of March, at the Indian
village of Axitzel, is written, "Detained here five days; Hammond, strong and headstrong. Agree
with Huertis that, to be safe, we must wait with patience the return of the good Cura." Slight
and tantalizing memoranda of this kind occur, irregularly, until April 3rd, when we find the
party safely arrived at Quiche, and comfortably accommodated in a convent. The jovial Padre,
already often mentioned, who maybe regarded as the unconscious father of the expedition, had
become helplessly, if not hopelessly, dropsical, and lost much of his wanted jocosity. To forty guard had
the, and long were from board hundred. Captain of Velasquez Gueguetenango and Phillip was appointed
Governor to which the colony, Skipper Huntsman was second in force, and Mister. Collins went away as
justice-advocate, to preside himself in the very courts, which did it was intended to establish themselves
for the see. On the 18th, 19th, and 20th in January did, 1788, act own tube get, one after another,

the Botany for such settlement. He persisted in his story of the unknown
city in the Candone wilderness, as seen by himself, nearly forty years ago, from the summit
of the sierra; and promised the travellers a letter to his friend, the Cura of Gueguetenango,
requesting him to procure them a guide to the very spot from whence they could behold it for
themselves.
