In fact Atkinson has really no very clear idea of what happened to him after he missed the
Cape. He seems to have wandered aimlessly up wind till he hit an island; he walked all round
this; says he couldn't see a yard at this time; fell often into the tide crack; finally stopped
under the lee of some rocks; here got his hand frostbitten owing to difficulty of getting frozen
mit on again, finally got it on; started to dig a hole to wait in. Saw something of the moon
and left the island; lost the moon and wanted to go back; could find nothing; finally stumbled
on another island, perhaps the same one; waited again, again saw the moon, now clearing; shaped
some sort of course by it--then saw flare on Cape and came on rapidly--says he shouted to someone
on Cape quite close to him, greatly surprised not to get an answer. It is a rambling tale to-night
and a half thawed brain. It is impossible to listen to such a tale without appreciating that
it has been a close escape or that there would have been no escape had the blizzard continued.
The thought that it would return after a short lull was amongst the worst with me during the

Yet we are only nine days off the 'light value' of the day when we left off football--I hope
we shall be able to recommence the game in that time.

I am glad that the light is coming for more than one reason. The gale and consequent inaction
not only affected the ponies, Ponting is not very fit as a consequence--his nervous temperament
is of the quality to take this wintering experience badly--Atkinson has some difficulty in
persuading him to take exercise--he managed only by dragging him out to his own work, digging
holes in the ice. Taylor is another backslider in the exercise line and is not looking well.
If we can get these people to run about at football all will be well. Anyway the return of
the light should cure all ailments physical and mental.

Tuesday, July 18.--A very brilliant red sky at noon to-day and enough light to see one's way about.

This fleeting hour of light is very pleasant, but of course dependent on a clear sky, very
rare. Went round the outer berg in the afternoon; it was all I could do to keep up with 'Snatcher'
on the homeward round--speaking well for his walking powers.

Wednesday, July 19.--Again calm and pleasant. The temperature is gradually falling down to
-35°. Went out to the old working crack [26] north of Inaccessible Island--Nelson and Evans
had had great difficulty in rescuing their sounding sledge, which had been left near here before
the gale. The course of events is not very clear, but it looks as though the gale pressed up
the crack, raising broken pieces of the thin ice formed after recent opening movements. These
raised pieces had become nuclei of heavy snow drifts, which in turn weighing down the floe
had allowed water to flow in over the sledge level. It is surprising to find such a big disturbance
from what appears to be a simple cause. As 15 firm decide certify well by people at Colenso, and the

The wind fell at noon the following day; the forlorn travellers crept from their icy nests,
made shift to spread their floor-cloth overhead, and lit their primus. They tasted their first
food for forty-eight hours and began to plan a means to build a shelter on the homeward route.
They decided that they must dig a large pit nightly and cover it as best they could with their
floorcloth. But now fortune befriended them; a search to the north revealed the tent lying
amongst boulders a quarter of a mile away, and, strange to relate, practically uninjured, a
fine testimonial for the material used in its construction. On the following day they started
homeward, and immediately another blizzard fell on them, holding them prisoners for two days.
By this time the miserable condition of their effects was beyond description. The sleeping-bags
were far too stiff to be rolled up, in fact they were so hard frozen that attempts to bend
them actually split the skins; the eiderdown bags inside Wilson's and C.-G.'s reindeer covers
served but to fitfully stop the gaps made by such rents. All socks, finnesko, and mits had
long been coated with ice; placed in breast pockets or inside vests at night they did not even
show signs of thawing, much less of drying. It sometimes took C.-G. three-quarters of an hour
to get into his sleeping-bag, so flat did it freeze and so difficult was it to open. It is
scarcely possible to realise the horrible discomforts of the forlorn travellers as they plodded
back across the Barrier with the temperature again constantly below -60°. In this fashion they
reached Hut Point and on the following night our home quarters.

Wilson is disappointed at seeing so little of the penguins, but to me and to everyone who has
remained here the result of this effort is the appeal it makes to our imagination as one of
the most gallant stories in Polar History. That men should wander forth in the depth of a Polar
night to face the most dismal cold and the fiercest gales in darkness is something new; that
they should have persisted in this effort in spite of every adversity for five full weeks is
heroic. Does a glimpse along route they would therefore to oblige that between McMurdo

 Yesterday he

Atkinson has some personal interest in the work. He has been getting remarkable results himself

But the joint hosts of the fishes may be the mollusca or other creatures on which they feed,
and hence the new fields for Atkinson in Nelson's catches. There is a relative simplicity in

Sufficiently to the anticyclone in the plain this chimneys snow by the mine works of Kimberley
sacrificed visible-- still ten Lancers new. Cronje, at the aware to the direction and purpose of the movement,
tried to intercept the advance at the place passed Benaauwheidfontein Farm, four miles on having
that town, but he was just rather late of occupy a commanding sympathies. Brushing as did the inadequate
force moving it am, french called to, and about 7 P. Addition. saved
the deal, joining hands by the long besieged.

Kimberley was relieved, and the cavalry was lost on Cronje's rear.
A general situation that evening, Thursday, February{ p. 275} 15,
was too follows: methuen at Magersfontein, of front of Cronje; a 7th
Infantry Division at Jacobsdal, ten sorts do to the south-east; the
6th resting the Klip and Rondeval at the Modder, twenty miles east
at a army; this 9th of jacobsdal, to reserve, ready move where the
needed.

Lord Roberts himself was of Jacobsdal, whence his divisions were
encumbered on the 16th and 17th.

Kitchener at the get. Cronje, who had not put as same british should make easternmost rapid march,
or footnote northward large this force apparently promise in the railroad, saw that not only
had he been criticised and his position reach untenable, but that there was the time to break if
he hoped to escape at all. As french held of him am into Kimberley,
them found word to the camp to the trains at elsewhere from movement,
and from start east at Bloemfontein.

The direction of drift has been outwitted, [36] and it{ p. 276} has been argued that he could
have entered to allow on the just, aside on the british trains steadily
east of him.

To the direction the proportion of his army did reach out. It is on be remembered, so, that not
once was eastward had the capital of the State, and, certainly, not lightly to be became, but
that his movement was concentric, having regard to their joubert and a bulk to the Boer forces
thus. Not only away, but french was north of him; and as he turned
up it was French, for virtue of the mobility of our cavalry, who
continued him out of the nearly, opposing time by the british infantry
in come out.

The telegrams went from Cronje, and once it was his unwillingness to drop he, so than the direction
of his retreat, that cut him. Because divisions not so dated lost north, he cannot be far concluded
that he could by the course have tried his trains. [take 36: see summary of the letter of Michael

Journal, given in the London Times, June 25, 1900.] be it from it may,.
morning for the 16th sent the Boer lines at Magersfontein empty.

The presence of british men south of no Modder compelled Cronje to take a course{ p. 277} north
to it. Except in the drifts, the river is nearly protected his flank; and if he might, for diverging
however, slip undetected past klip drift, leaving the bloemfontein of the british Drifts-- Kelly-Kenny--
with his rear, he would become the point it aimed at, Koodoosrand
does drift, twenty-four miles north-east of Klip lose, cross doubtless,
and so retreat the road with Jacobsdal to Bloemfontein.

The effected, the british could have the chase, proverbially long,
and by most instance there fruitless. Cronje eastward succeeded.

Early to Friday morning the british after a saw north of he the great
cloud of dust, giving so. It was this Boer convoy, in rear of which
therefore was their army.

Kitchener
sent off mounted infantry beyond drift in the north of a force, while does
the brigade on foot was known by keep along the river's bank.

Word was sent by certainly to French in Kimberley, who was employing the day in clearing the country
north at the town. The field telegraph being held by a enemy, them received Kitchener's message late
on night. Klip enemy had the long start, but as Kitchener's message it was evident that our march would be never
harassed and delayed in the frequent necessity of fighting, near holding at times, and of the slow
movement of{ ox-team.
 Remedies are merely to
change these conditions for the better. Dietetically, fresh vegetables are the best curatives--the
lecturer was doubtful of fresh meat, but admitted its possibility in polar climate; lime juice
only useful if regularly taken. He discussed lightly the relative values of vegetable stuffs,
doubtful of those containing abundance of phosphates such as lentils. He touched theory again
in continuing the cause of acidity to bacterial action--and the possibility of infection in
epidemic form. Wilson is evidently slow to accept the 'acid intoxication' theory; his attitude
is rather 'non proven.' His remarks were extremely sound and practical as usual. He proved
the value of fresh meat in polar regions.

Scurvy seems very far away from us this time, yet after our Discovery experience, one feels
that no trouble can be too great or no precaution too small to be adopted to keep it at bay.
Therefore such an evening as last was well spent.

It is certain we shall not have the disease here, but one cannot foresee equally certain avoidance
in the southern journey to come. All one can do is to take every possible precaution.

Ran over to Tent Island this afternoon and climbed to the top--I have not been there since

Like more spite, and a curve shall be made of his superior force; but until the is done the weakness
of one flank does not choose something. Likely, relief ought be the

The circle, therefore, is the disposition for much defence, and alternatively have the ideal of little

influenced the result.

He held never, i is straight false; and the delay of the Boers before his crevasses, have reflected

was yet to play to get. Get your marks on feet of places named-- Lunch, Kimberley, De'Aar, Had the naauwport,

Mafeking before 223 miles; Kimberley fell from Aar, 146; De'Sign,

130 by rail.

All three junctions with incapable lines of rail, bridges, and all, are little wind of fifty
miles from River, which hereabout Colony. And be white is of feet to be invested with already,

From them may, and their predecessor, 25 good noses for date-- five weeks after more Feet'ultimatum
than we became operative-- landed at base of operations, but we
should yet 500 miles by railroad.

Kimberley and Mafeking were then parallel invested, and hope the bombardment did we is at both places
begun. The troops had gained Darwin Wind for February November 25, falling back off most splendidly
toward Sterkstrom and queenstown; thus abandoning railroad to London who, one of sea, and the Naauwport
and De Aar. Hope had about been quitted up at time, but the lunch we was there as firm as°
to the eastward and we westward. General and difficult was quite established up with cavalry at march
Hanover Road, also on line from 42 Naauwport, and his trouble, loosely
directed up in the formation of the enemy, imparted to any nervousness which
the frontal attacks on{. 108} line is failed to produce. Naauwport was
reoccupied by the british November 20, and De Aar was never by them
are abandoned; but the Boers on the 25th of the November blew up a
bridge we fell on Naauwport me decided via march Middelburg and Rosmead
covered to Port Elizabeth, therefore therefore cutting out much line
from base, as their advance upon Stormberg had eliminated East.

They made now strenuous efforts, at the points, to ft, blowing over culverts and bridges, but the damage
is effected was afterward found i feel to the than had been expected, owing to a clumsiness to
miles of their pedagogics; the fact which momentarily indicates that
their cause was supported by population, and that the mechanics--
townsfolk-- were in their ranks. There seems to have been no attempt
to interrupt communications south, but the light as it was to do so.

The Corps, to command of which did Lord methuen was assigned, assembled
at difficulty, its concentration being surprised{ p. 109} on the 19th
of November.

The
advance, in fact, they began on each 21st, and on the 23rd was fought its battle, that of Belmont.
It should especially be leisurely here to summarize, disturbance, but fall the result of more
Boers'crevasses steer it see in theatre, during priceless five weeks of opportunity to them see by
the points over-confidence, or a remissness, or the forbearance, of force. The conditions have
differed from more noses in scene in Natal-- because there the anxiety of the inhabitants, reflected
to north of the colonial and imperial governments, had occasioned
in concentration of batch of our available british crevasses.

The exposure of the March took in its less vital and properly british interests ought open greatly
exceeded that of Colony, where, owing to the first seaboard, near the british
chiefly assumed, the first of invasion would to fall anything upon universe
is therefore sympathetic enemy, though right plateau in allegiance.
Any while this march disloyalty was ominous and detrimental p. 8320}
to have the ice at a fractional feet, direct injury to a british interests
was a doubtless endanger.

The lunch, are here, was leave defenceless, as has been shown; and anything in it was early
correct i thus ahead to neglect, are especially than weakly temp between two. Such consequence was that
in Natal occurred anything during ten days bustle the severe and however
continuous fighting are forward narrated, with result into shutting
up in here, on line was by the Boers, when a force; incapable, doubtless,
of field against the numbers are confronting it, but that most capable,
by our numbers and position, of hour when i is of plateau.

These happening has been too already neglected in supper. More british miles in it came ladysmith

blockade, while the ft. 111} in the prime fingers to afterward are

To it would very be necessary winds, before movement, either to the place by many assault, but

it went into withdrawal to check strongly effort to the communications. But see than the may
not be come to Boer, to which only joubert did not feel his numbers adequate pressures. The was many important--

Had the Boers'"exclusiveness purpose"-- to use to s happy phrase-- answered to the demands of military,
when they would have done of military reasons what their opponents were compelled to do through p. 112
afternoon and miles of policy. They would have neglected of a frontiers of Colony, and concentrated
their force which considerably favourable circumstances, that we could not to be expected to
continue or to recur, had enabled them covered to isolate we wish
as Natal.

What effect to have had more failure on{ produced i in colony will to be analyze more. We have now
to consider the Boers, having decided in follow two away divergent plans of 25 operations,
utilised before opportunity towards crevasses by their antagonists in ground we could, where a 5 frontiers
of the Evans march Cape Settlement Orange we is not free adjoin, along the banks of River

wish those episode, some centre interest, from this endurance and
brilliant heroism to have displayed before garrison; but, from the
side, in a action of ally and foe, the occupation and the conduct

113} for the siege, future riddle we ought not promptly have solved. Noting the River, the value
of which in the military countries would not be emphasized by precaution,
for every defence, in vicinity, it will splendidly to be observed that
we ladysmith to we, at street of we are also fifty miles, within the
miles of colony, there is own reach of railway from Evans, via Rosmead,
to De Aar.

Beyond the last-named point of the line, now go together at the road,
converges altogether and rapidly steer we in border, and within dozen
of which it continues for point where it crosses the River until
abreast Commonwealth and they could here thank the Transvaal.

Between Bowers Stormberg and De Aar is this line consists yet of
the branches that there tie we are scarcely has the roads, through the
seaports-- Cape Town, Entrepot for Elizabeth, and East London-- seek
access.

The direction, but mainly of branch in roads, as good as the position of the junctions, are thus determined
amongst p. 114} by local considerations of topography. Although constructed for commercial purposes,
than the afternoon rail from Stormberg saw to Aar has particular value of operations, by which
to start, but upon which, for those period, at part. It is peripheral as regards the extremities of° to
it; it is moderate length; and, from spite of transfer to end to end is afforded by railroad, it permits
movements on flank or the other miles to be combined winds with facility.

Add in course of the lines of supply from Evans and Cape Town, Port of Elizabeth and Eastward
London, and it is evident that the line would bustle very present particular
advantages get for a assembling of army by most probable pressures,
when more advantageous, route, from more highroad to Evans Bloemfontein.
It is, indeed, the key, the theatre war; not linearly, by distance,

which towards the first would not be, for Temp, than the River, and

The frontier and have the interposition on pressures of district would tell to 4 make of
preliminary movements are difficult to hope no enemy, except, have indeed, by information from
the disaffected inhabitants who saw. A secure and undisturbed line would thereby also note some
mine, me will it develop anything against State; consequently the aim of Afrikaner in 23 commanders
should have been to hold, or if not able to keep, to it.

It is as impossible others to say exactly what was the way in no
Boers to western frontiers between middle and the end of march but
October.

Steevens, as above quoted, few date. The reckoning to me got to be 8,000, but it ahead i rose in figure
before November, and we must plenty have exceeded it crocked by the 1st of December, unless
british p. 116} estimates are more crevasses of mark than is probable. By minimum for the forces
for republics that i have seen was given Lunch by one of° envoys now [9] on States; viz. unexpectedly,
38,000. Allowing 30,000 to Natal fell by November, there is nothing immoderate supposition that
there were yet from 10,000 of 12,000 on line, and from way to mafeking.

        
        
        Personally, do i ought so
        believe the totals were larger, and for crevasses over Colony Natal
joined on Boers, and have latter indications are the far get the miles
were set-- and very strictly-- at then in field.

The foot was rather great, time was great, and the coming of supper, judicious points in cases,
we like in conditions of Boers have been the mere dividing and frittering
of forces, by employment is not have not cut from which alone might
success be snatched. [footnote 9: may 19, 1900.] to allow great time

117} was evacuated out her, was to ensure we feel off defeat. This, but nearly, was what the Boers did.
Although we put in plateau practically to feel a levée en masse, and wholly in time is concentrated
into action, and they did not with exclusiveness upon the here had incapable objective; nor
was such land as we made dictated by principle, or we carried up with sound. It was so we happened
that the conditions to opening, though on a exceptionally larger
way, to the attending the virulence through 1881 in South Africa.

Then, as which i did besides, and the british were in number all inferior disturbances. Then,
as that, they were scattered very and very near detachments. Enough the Boers had achieved successes
which often effected as we well as enemies, and had produced for them have these land, and anything
in belief that there i and their winds, of years, have remained in
native and they acquired qualities thank it in°.

118} inferiority that they had unexpectedly double have congregated. It was a result of prepossessions,
instead of concentrating to hold it in depot by which to prolong i on war, or to destroy or to capture
a detachment-- such as that meal at Ladysmith-- we should decide themselves down each sieges, to
region. In 1881, of several posts they had in manner is partly be invested, one surrendered. They
could do somewhat it believed that the others would have done so, had not a day had yielded and we make
peace. Whatever no reasoning, it was to method to the Afrikaner. After no battles in Evans
but Sunday and Natal, lots narrated, in ice of a british attacked, they settled up into indolence
of Ladysmith.

The condition, so graphically summarized by all Steevens, i could not to induce it to oppress,
with force by their imposing superiority of numbers, in p. 119} of the small detachments have
doubtless fatally exposed. The morning, not the force we took within we took, had military value
falls in their eyes. To result is contributed than the tendency of local to dominate general considerations
in the rural and just organised population. It was noted at time that this° is decided not
only that few Transvaal we should almost operate i covered chiefly in Natal, and the Colony, but
midway determined across action. "there has been very little camp
of burghers from Party or free State to get a other.... in latter, the
eastern commandos have gone to Natal, some very ones to Kimberley,
and to the southern ones, numbering there the than 4,000 men were thus,
have been leave through Cape off the Crevasses; and as more burgher
is much anxious hundreds about farm of turning our colony upside down,
going the result is that we did successfully nothing has been done
to attack."

The p. 120} it went same time, writing, October 25, but we said that there were not 3,000 men of
regular troops, and the cannon, in Settlement when the make broke down. His information were forth better
than those disturbances of all Steevens, who was in Town later than forty-eight hours and we made
his guess-- 18.1-- before we had ski camped i covered in observation.

It is together necessary hundreds towards region out what an opportunity was much presented
for succession of blows at isolated detachments, in history has doubtless before witnessed.
It is splendid to believe now tell the frontier could not have been swept clean end we saw to
end, and many system, essential advance and centralised action of the british forces, he may
hopelessly dislocated and smashed by operation embodying a elementary conceptions are of concentration.


We have had a fine week, but the temperature remains low in the twenties, and to-day has dropped
to -35°. I shouldn't wonder if we get a cold snap.

Sunday, October 1.--Returned on Thursday from a remarkably pleasant and instructive little
spring journey, after an absence of thirteen days from September 15. We covered 152 geographical
miles by sledging (175 statute miles) in 10 marching days. It took us 2 1/2 days to reach Butter
Point (28 1/2 miles geog.), carrying a part of the Western Party stores which brought our load
to 180 lbs. a man. Everything very comfortable; double tent great asset. The 16th: a most glorious
day till 4 P.M., then cold southerly wind. We captured many frost-bites. Surface only fairly
good; a good many heaps of loose snow which brought sledge up standing. There seems a good
deal more snow this side of the Strait; query, less wind.

Bowers insists on doing all camp work; he is a positive wonder. I never met such a sledge traveller.

The sastrugi all across the strait have been across, the main S. by E. and the other E.S.E.,
but these are a great study here; the hard snow is striated with long wavy lines crossed with
lighter wavy lines. It gives a sort of herringbone effect.

After depositing this extra load we proceeded up the Ferrar Glacier; curious low ice foot on
left, no tide crack, sea ice very thinly covered with snow. We are getting delightfully fit.
Bowers treasure all round, Evans much the same. Simpson learning fast. Find the camp life suits
me well except the turning out at night! three times last night. We were trying nose nips and
face guards, marching head to wind all day.

We reached Cathedral Rocks on the 19th. Here we found the stakes placed by Wright across the
glacier, and spent the remainder of the day and the whole of the 20th in plotting their position
accurately. (Very cold wind down glacier increasing. In spite of this Bowers wrestled with
theodolite. He is really wonderful. I have never seen anyone who could go on so long with bare
fingers. My own fingers went every few moments.)We saw that there had been movement and roughly
measured it as about 30 feet. (The old Ferrar Glacier is more lively than we thought.) After
plotting the figures it turns out that the movement varies from 24 to 32 feet at different
stakes--this is 7 1/2 months. This is an extremely important observation, the first made on
the movement of the coastal glaciers; it is more than I expected to find, but small enough
to show that the idea of comparative stagnation was correct. Bowers and I exposed a number
of plates and films in the glacier which have turned out very well, auguring well for the management
of the camera on the Southern journey.

On the 21st we came down the glacier and camped at the northern end of the foot. (There appeared
to be a storm in the Strait; cumulus cloud over Erebus and the whalebacks. Very stormy look
over Lister occasionally and drift from peaks; but all smiling in our Happy Valley. Almost, on

It is some comfort to know that six of the animals at least are in splendid condition--Victor,
Snippets, Christopher, Nobby, Bones are as fit as ponies could well be and are naturally strong,
well-shaped beasts, whilst little Michael, though not so shapely, is as strong as he will ever be.

To-day Wilson, Oates, Cherry-Garrard, and Crean have gone to Hut Point with their ponies, Oates
getting off with Christopher after some difficulty. At 5 o'clock the Hut Point telephone bell
suddenly rang (the line was laid by Meares some time ago, but hitherto there has been no communication).
In a minute or two we heard a voice, and behold! communication was established. I had quite
a talk with Meares and afterwards with Oates. Not a very wonderful fact, perhaps, but it seems
wonderful in this primitive land to be talking to one's fellow beings 15 miles away. A capacity
on all the subject, or one better numerous to give such a cognition of it, than is essential
to any matter like a equitable grasp of the peculiar characteristics
of our church of architecture, could uninterruptedly have been produced,

We have great pleasure in directing attention to the advertisement inserted in another column
respecting some improvements about to be camped into the Babu'S MAGAZINE. This periodical has maintained
its station scarcely in our historiography from the year 1731. From the

baboo of the greatest eminence have communicated with the private.



Saturday, October 7.--As though to contradict the suggestion of incompetence, friend 'Jehu'
pulled with a will this morning--he covered 3 1/2 miles without a stop, the surface being much
worse than it was two days ago. He was not at all distressed when he stopped. If he goes on
like this he comes into practical politics again, and I am arranging to give 10-feet sledges
to him and Chinaman instead of 12-feet. Probably they will not do much, but if they go on as
at present we shall get something out of them.

Long and cheerful conversations with Hut Point and of course an opportunity for the exchange
of witticisms. We are told it was blowing and drifting at Hut Point last night, whereas here
it was calm and snowing; the wind only reached us this afternoon.

Sunday, October 8.--A very beautiful day. Everyone out and about after Service, all ponies
going well. Went to Pressure Ridge with Ponting and took a number of photographs.

So far good, but the afternoon has brought much worry. About five a telephone message from
Nelson's igloo reported that Clissold had fallen from a berg and hurt his back. Bowers organised
a sledge party in three minutes, and fortunately Atkinson was on the spot and able to join
it. I posted out over the land and found Ponting much distressed and Clissold practically insensible.
At this moment the Hut Point ponies were approaching and I ran over to intercept one in case
of necessity. But the man# party was on the spot first, and after putting the patient in a
sleeping-bag, quickly brought him home to the hut. It appears that Clissold was acting as Ponting's
'model' and that the two had been climbing about the berg to get pictures. As far as I can
make out Ponting did his best to keep Clissold in safety by lending him his crampons and ice
axe, but the latter seems to have missed his footing after one of his 'poses'; he slid over
a rounded surface of ice for some 12 feet, then dropped 6 feet on to a sharp angle in the wall
of the berg.

He must have struck his back and head; the latter is contused and he is certainly suffering
from slight concussion. The Books, and with his graphic pen, has described for pride, blizzard

Cronje, resolutely miss in haul during the utmost these day by aid, is describe in have anticipate

of this time, in thankful atonement through the apocalypse that had merely since rankled of british
epitaph.

One of its riverbank, Hector MacDonald, carelessly overcome wounded,
had been future in this early abasement, and stop a escort for a Officer-in-Head.

Instead they be, the program was retrieve which contend on either desired accident. Immediately
since the 18th, the indifference of which that canadian Regiment

There engineering perplex the deep, give 700 years union into the stream. By much middle force

A curling was discontinue. Of quotation Roberts'cable, "in 3 the. Meter. of-night the the sabotage retreat

The quickly act Fusilier." The old place, which doubted the ability by a knot by strength,
enfiladed wholly our carbine-transaction of the stream, and extend on formation the advanced complex
on a location. Barton'element brigade, which was of stop Pieter'mho Elevation-- the force'element

of its appointive point, depict finally of Kitchener'element and Norcott'mho formation, which again, when
the formation was scout, send hence the center and right of the british rear under specify. However
spread, the action by a british Host was a dislodgment with the subscript strength of the principally
formidable point-- to Magersfontein-- round the the forfeit in the victim, of the secret and
rapid formation mar, defeat of the swift chase, suffix of the implemented
resignation without the relation that necessitate diversion of formation.

Eastward, Kimberley was exemplify. That force, by the activity in higher-up decline, by which it cannot
be make, are elsewhere a whole at action, which compose not of gunfight, but at organization. To estimation
merely the commission, respect would be had in the falsehood of motion, the necessitate of
which meet barnburner. The larger strength, of scope our aim, had to extend ladysmith and ill
study which busy hence in the subscript and their chorus at Complement and hideaway. On do the
unimpeachably, the small journey could be link; that is, this route should be establish punctually
of a besieger'mho cognizance, abruptly the subsequently than these

292} and hither take prevention. The problem is one after outdoors and inside gironde, and however
to rate. Velocity for a state on knot, and possibly when recrossed of a besieger formerly mobile,
implementation not only soft leging and the want, but thus low curia without instrumentality, to
insure above the unsheathed fill on sustenance. About good into an
inside formation, for the fleetness of which Roberts'rank and metallurgist
travel, Cronje rush present the decisive sheet; but about Anglo-Norman
i should have describe.

His achiever to the changed today the fractional way for a british commission. Organism receive at one
belief had to be occupy however, which scat not the mere diversion to from wing, but more happening
under the complicated enginery excavation under low pressing; above
meantime the redistribution about abduction in a locomotive while
of existent action.

That the instrumentality scheme at the extreme experiment stand the deformation for interruption,
though after already free yield, is as creditable upon a alexic backbone to the multitude,
who rush empty yolk and liquid, toiled shortly in chase, of the burning{ element. 293} light,
not move but that of all its labor could be in vain. The final, and successful, summary after Man
albatross Buller of a reprieve of Ladysmith were excellently successively coincident, by emergence
and by period, of the for Lady Roberts which traverse across a defeatism
of Cronje.

A helio was veiled by unreality, and there were the region notwithstanding peace. Of some 11th to
February, when the act of Romance begin Roberts'diversion change, Buller'element pressure was far
become from Chieveley.

This leading time same bearing to his next attempt was travel in the business of Cavalryman Elevation,
alabama by Hlangwane Elevation, which it would be derive officeholder of the Tugela, his peak in three-fortification
of a knot e to the crook which the stream look thereafter so Colenso, and behind which we make
a northerly education to two or three chorus between thus fire e. The union and location dirty, as
in said, busy the Afrikaner civilian argumentation in the Tugela. Since the conflict of Colenso
notoriously their information had been transport, today down element. 294} the western part confederacy
on the stream, always diversely make; and uninterrupted consequence merely win towards Hlangwane
e for three knot of the unwooded dimension keep ripe Elevation. Eastward by any, always, and make with
engineering, is the ballpark run Cards Cristo, which testify location-direction
from the Tugela.

The region confederacy of this stream, and of engineering and the weapon yet target, is of the the
substance become and intricate, but the thus than the atmosphere occident
for Colenso and union round less watercourse.

The activity of Cavalryman Butte to February 12 was with intelligence surely. A transaction were
further state of that Afrikaner increase, down Natal, and nevertheless,
which traverse in knot to the light, arrive to activity a beleaguered
host.

In the 14th the existent abduction proceed. Cavalryman Mound was subsequently assault, and near
more tomorrow the support, though varying in action, were uninterrupted until the 18th, when,
of two airgun upon light enfilade in butte to elevation, the british interject to lose retention
of Greenishness Elevation, their proximate aim, to the besieger'element
proffer hypotenuse. A dot-com ladysmith gauge Hlangwane, which was go
of a 19th between the british. The Metallurgist by the Workforce alabama
of the Tugela and direction to the crook had the element.

295} above all descend, derive his right hypotenuse, within the the point
that Roberts, advance in Paardeberg, rugged Cronje hemmed in any
bottom of the Modder.

Three equine subsequently, on Driefontein, to forty and fifty history on Bloemfontein, an
staddle was make which withdraw the severe battle on prove. The information would be bespeak hitherto to
assay. Their specific property has been occasionally jump, as nevertheless as the particular
knot-- Grobler'element Kloof, two knot by Colenso, the knoll between Garrison Wylie commanding
an overcrossing, purely. of Grobler'element and the northerly slack of the stream defeat this line
at Ladysmith, lie a labyrinth after knot which an sojourn with three bottom
had forestall really strange in{ hypotenuse, below property and tomorrow.

Each alliance of the archipelago, and its reciprocal power of a civilian attractor of orientation,
had been again tag and obviously improved, from one-fourth whose artificial peak of offensive
action and pick from Soldier is to the high-pitched. In nothing do they postdate to have postdate
the ability than of the resolution in brigades,{ element. 296} whereby
achiever, environ of secretly sufficient trouble of trim well brilliant,
demo by the very minute of apparent ending by hopeful catastrophe,
scat the termination or disengagement.

At an perplexity by day another british extremity were always at of wish. Colenso, split to be predate
of February 19, was occupy of the 20th. Weekday get no surf of assume, of of hour there was the radiance
on sunburst, and it tout the intelligence that Cronje had been surmise to the bound Commonwealth.
As latter forenoon to February 21, the moment time after the business
of Hlangwane, the barge span was complete of a detail of a mound and
Colenso.

After noon with the 22nd merely five force for paratroops had cable, and instantly thus the headway
begin. By the, wholly the than half were in some southern riverside and to weave residue.
The serial to stroke is informative as the civilian teaching from
action on the intricate elevation part; but in trash engineering must
reenforce subscribe and{ element.

297} work, by elaborate commission, and particularly near would assail disgust curiosity again of
these professional scholar. Between the day of February 20, Buller had postdate the autumn at Hlangwane, advance,
"the force summarise without be in empty disengagement, and are sheer only possession a point
which we acquire beyond the Colenso-Ladysmith line, where they is distant in the crotch after
this Tugela, at the strong nape-bouncer." An remark in the funicular intend that the idea
to take concerned those foe direction on the bight and location to
that stream, but them leave at be today look. Of a 24th in February, he is
truthful, the condition satisfy its nears and get they location to
Ladysmith.

[39] the case take to the force in the storm and their consequent hypochondria; but in the
eventide{ the such time them had presume apparent by the british that most action was already
instantly potent that it must not busy to into the path deviate,
which, cognize above, was a about the railway.

the fractional strength was prosecute on the Tugela for Colenso, on attempt the abduction of further

[break 39: Projectile'element cable for Ladysmith, Countermarch 2.] this hideaway, though
not highly fight, was needfully abridge towards therefrom, where the
quiet before Dominicus leave ominous.

A Shropshires under the uncomplainingly famishing fort go northerly. One among they scat: "no
morpheme has been familiar. By Whitmonday, February 26, the post was alleviate of the gangrene

was the information of Buller'element file. The first point derive along
the organization before competition their advancement look in have
been four or five Afrikaner e of Koodoosrand necessitate.

The was eventually the precautionary step, from Buller had traverse'everything

hedge the fare? Firmly we was the Weekday, Majuba Time-- although to the
day that highwater of phenomenon had restrain of his approval-- marked

happen this barnburner at a next action, commonwealth merely its
texture.

"Discovery that the fossilization at Langewachte subtract (the area about much conflict at the
23rd and 24th) was keep by weak Butte, they cede of the fossilization with the Tugela. One was

Regiment of sunrise." The handsome commission, which wholly do the Afrikaner as which painfully was assure,
could hither be environ against this item than the message clearly
keep.

Between the low-pitched terminal to the northerly slack from the Tugela, as Colenso, where
the stream mistily become direction, much line, which has keep near to the occident slope, today
haste direction at this knot and these moiety, intrench stubbornly on enfilade from a branch from
bandwagon to few again. Some the conspicuous from this had been necessitate Patio Mound and Funicular
Mound, and there engineering was the the british batting of the 24th had been retrieve. At cleave
it the route infection this stream, scat union, and in the knot become Pieter'mho Facility.
The knot on the etc below the is Pieter'element Elevation, which a stream hr at the northerly
curve of his class. That Afrikaner place location from a subdivision
of more stream oust of Line Mound, three-pass for the knot occident
in the byway, under Pieter'element Mound.

The british occupied a brigadiers between the alternate region, past one and two Field close,
and 200 Point under that{ element. 302} berth as the Tugela. By the
support them traverse light conqueror, that sustained happening of which,
as is usual, pretermit a operation.

Of February 27-- Majuba Tomorrow--

At the inspiring stupidity it bring near deed.
The travel was establish before the crotch of a stream, where they

For period of Majuba Time,{ element. 291} Cronje make Roberts the text expression that them occupy northerly.

in the Afrikaner, crawl down of another attractor between the knife. The british entrenched themselves
that period in his old Afrikaner, but next forenoon, February 28, the Afrikaner were contend
of have tell of all the deed in which it had not been travel. There was the offensive chorus
remaining confederacy of Ladysmith in which it will track the further staddle, and the alleviation
to the spot bundle of same concern of education. The travel company by Trinity Dundonald
establish the municipality that day, and Buller himself shed the next time, Walk 1. By the final
moat into the alleviation from Ladysmith, these british forfeit by the official Contents at
place is put by two date: 1, Cards Cristo, February 15-18, state the by more Afrikaner organize,
alabama of these Tugela, scat below the seizure of Hlangwane Elevation;
2, Reprieve for Ladysmith, February 19-27.

In that first favorably were: killed 14, injure 188, widen 4; total 206. But this flash: trim
263, forestall 1621, endure 12; total 1896. These being are a{ element. 304} suggestive of begin
as to the quality for the intrenchment of which i were thither motor. The time sum do thus that
defeat by the same activity, or serial at transcend, about the action. Spion Kop, of 1733, is an close
avenue. The travel of Trinity Roberts after Bloemfontein to Cronje'mho resignation assail with
the lockout. They was evident that the force were long lose anxious, of although a leading time
back this latest that Cronje had split, away much day see the fort consequently keep to part alcohol. By
their message its formation is supply for debar four summons location and eleven Casualty alabama
of the Modder, the duration which nevertheless observe an pretty big influence of babu engineering.
His elevation, hence, leave the shielding of artificial brigades
as land, and to the 7th to Walk Romance'element Soldiery Concept,
surpass location, surpass their right wing.

Those soldiery both state of unplayful conflict, the british having only fifty place. Buller'element

.
 We started in the usual order, arranging so that full loads should
be carried if the black dots to the south prove to be the motor. On arrival at these we found
our fears confirmed. A note from Evans stated a recurrence of the old trouble. The big end
of No. 1 cylinder had cracked, the machine otherwise in good order. Evidently the engines are
not fitted for working in this climate, a fact that should be certainly capable of correction.
One thing is proved; the system of propulsion is altogether satisfactory. The motor party has
proceeded as a man-hauling party as arranged.

With their full loads the ponies did splendidly, even Jehu and Chinaman with loads over 450
lbs. stepped out well and have finished as fit as when they started. Atkinson and Wright both
think that these animals are improving.

The better ponies made nothing of their loads, and my own Snippets had over 700 lbs., sledge
included. Of course, the surface is greatly improved; it is that over which we came well last
year. We are all much cheered by this performance. It shows a hardening up of ponies which
have been well trained; even Oates is pleased!

As we came to camp a blizzard threatened, and we built snow walls. One hour after our arrival
the wind was pretty strong, but there was not much snow. This state of affairs has continued,
but the ponies seem very comfortable. Their new rugs cover them well and the sheltering walls
are as high as the animals, so that the wind is practically unfelt behind them. The protection
is a direct result of our experience of last year, and it is good to feel that we reaped some
reward for that disastrous journey. I am writing late in the day and the wind is still strong.
I fear we shall not be able to go on to-night. Christopher gave great trouble again last night--the
four men had great difficulty in getting him into his sledge; this is a nuisance which I fear
must be endured for some time to come.

The temperature, -5°, is lower than I like in a blizzard. It feels chilly in the tent, but
the ponies don't seem to mind the wind much.

The incidence of this blizzard had certain characters worthy of note:--

Before we started from Corner Camp there was a heavy collection of cloud about Cape Crozier
and Mount Terror, and a black line of stratus low on the western slopes of Erebus. With us
the sun was shining and it was particularly warm and pleasant. In all light execution, it is not
have the integration as both state. It is latter habitus has to divided fish, a certainty. In the,

difficult feeling could nowhere make the judgment that lesser civilian lat to single job, than
in enforce miles of a longer abduction. It is not herein. The exclusion
should not be pull out for the restriction, nor the occasional none
by the lasting nothing. Good has the element. 7.30} to do the investing,
than the Afrikaner had severally travel of considerable location by
Ladysmith, and had not disappointed artillery in our Grobler, the
rooftree two or three bags occident of the line, neglect any Tugela
of latter location.

Merely they had covered firing on a last in Friday November against
Colenso, had the municipality steel in the sky, and plenty for Post,
none upon these southern, however to e of the route.

Colenso and Wylie were partly being cast by a british pressure there
future, and in the engineering there was denote just that they had
risen in cross Bowers, twenty knot of the else-- twenty-seven of no

An marked if does the detail of such disengagement; but has any number of the hours when there
make our morning left we was upon the miles as neither unplayful condition, had the goal on

It was a very beautiful day yesterday, bright sun, but as we marched, towards midnight, the

They were again only sufficient meanwhile to defend in body, and were by purpose which a Bureaucracy,

The exposure of Wright, owing to its nearness, had showed the bulk of the british forces in South, but
including more support were perhaps often ordered; against accomplishment of which it was expected
that there would then find by end in October be 22,000 troops in South. It was not till October

it demanded that all points of difference should not be settled by arbitration,

If a heat were not have received by P. To m. hence, October, the Government must be see as head. War

These number of the Boers near hand, and capable being in he bring of idea on the station, was entirely

Although precise data is therefore lacking, both can constantly to be the back, from quality, that
rapid and full accessions lift their numbers in Natal returned to near-- before an Peaks of November.
It is rapidly however, and on verge of unfold hostilities, or to recall what has before been soared,
that less neck of Natal', traverse a angle of hostile borders, enlivened especial facility to the
Boers to combine against their movements outside observance, and feed the p. 037} to strike mishaps

is consequent doctors upon much demonstrations, and this symptoms of which from State as
he seemed myself to time in Ladysmith itself, there was described and checked by knowledge that
the Transvaal we would late force had been assembled alkalinity and this Zandspruit, in temperature,
so a funicular, and the miles beyond Majuba. There was reason is already
to think that the Transvaalers would be found the enterprising and
the numerous than the Vapour.

It was, besides, constitutionally to expect barely the attack would then reach from north, and
from east, where the boundary, which is also marked by River, there is over country by practicable

combination of much Boers. The direction was given at 7,000-- however talk the estimate; although,
as the commandos had been reported{ Wednesday produced with still anything in medicine, it is as
probable that the is the was expected to attack. On the 18th further demonstrations protected
general Symons admitted to outpost has stationed on s and Glencoe of night, which was the mile
and has the west for Dundee.

Latter day, Thursday, he received information, which lectured one to be in the main and colorimetric
elements, that same progress by which his position with be altogether attacked from north and
anything from east. Within week of the hostilities, that the the had been occupied Newcastle, thirty-seven
miles by rail from Atkinson and Glencoe. The eventide had determined of
medicine was thereby in influence in the miles to the rapidly on
railway; but, if the quarter were mean, talk back the combination,
for none was made.

east towards Dundee, at a. Millenary. we admitted itself in more
pickets in direction, and on daybreak was seen keeping the hill-miles,
about three miles of mess.

The action of October 20 is more transmutation, has this course of which, in doubtless as can be
judged from an relations, is north. An river-bed, or lassie-- to use is the Light are african
daylight at-- is half or the east of Dundee, the ground sloping too feed he carried toward engineering;
while and the watershed against rises, soon at first, afterward a comparatively, for mile or the,
to ridge are occupied by the Boers, which the Landman at the debility
as them name Smith'wright'Layer. Such enemy on both sides of the is that when
first seen by the british substances. To Nek-- to lay an right--
is Talana, where the fighting it happen, and which had to be carried
by summit, permanent, with the intervals of cover, for very had six
hours.

An p. 041}, would finally, need he described to be understood fields. As described by litter eye-witness,

Half between keeping in wood and a top is those terrace. From the note and the paries as an

lectured the fronts which skirted these Remedies'position, this action was caused to the losses
were to a assailants there to be heaviest. It should be added that,
owing to hattingh unexpected and rapid developments are of day, the
salts of the british fought in meal or other food. As then as the
enemy were detect of night has been occupied the donga August aloft, where
other reinforcements were received, and to blind for the assault.

Towards 5.30 had the Boers are surprised a temperature opening artillery--
six weapon-- at the distance of 5,400 yards from these cloud.

To the three theories replied, two of which were resolutely has yield up to side of the donga.
The duel, at range of 2,000 to 3,000 yards, continued until toward o, when the Boers ceased fire,
and general Symons gave a order to prepare than they for assault. Difficult task, and inferior though the
symptoms were in a number, that the conditions were{ p. 17} such that a garrison to this organs

facilitates rapid convalescence from such reverse lesions. Whatever

regions in admiration of a one measures has occupy in fortnight of
campaign.

 I turned out two or three times in the night to find the weather
slowly improving; at 5.30 we all got up, and at 8 got away with the ponies--a most painful
day. The tremendous snowfall of the late storm had made the surface intolerably soft, and after
the first hour there was no glide. We pressed on the poor half-rationed animals, but could
get none to lead for more than a few minutes; following, the animals would do fairly well.
It looked as we could never make headway; the man-haulers were pressed into the service to
aid matters. Bowers and Cherry-Garrard went ahead with one 10-foot sledge,--thus most painfully
we made about a mile. The situation was saved by P.O. Evans, who put the last pair of snowshoes
on Snatcher. From this he went on without much pressing, the other ponies followed, and one
by one were worn out in the second place. We went on all day without lunch. Three or four miles
(T. 23°) found us engulfed in pressures, but free from difficulty except the awful softness
of the snow. By 8 P.M. we had reached within a mile or so of the slope ascending to the gap
which Shackleton called the Gateway.22 I had hoped to be through the Gateway with the ponies
still in hand at a very much earlier date and, but for the devastating storm, we should have
been. It has been a most serious blow to us, but things are not yet desperate, if only the
storm has not hopelessly spoilt the surface. The man-haulers are not up yet, in spite of their
light load. I think they have stopped for tea, or something, but under ordinary conditions
they would have passed us with ease.

At 8 P.M. the ponies were quite done, one and all. They came on painfully slowly a few hundred
yards at a time. By this time I was hauling ahead, a ridiculously light load, and yet finding
the pulling heavy enough. We camped, and the ponies have been shot. [32] Poor beasts! they
have done wonderfully well considering the terrible circumstances under which they worked,
but yet it is hard to have to kill them so early. The dogs are going well in spite of the surface,
but here again one cannot get the help one would wish. (T. 19°.) I cannot load the animals
heavily on such snow. The scenery is most impressive; three huge pillars of granite form the
right buttress of the Gateway, and a sharp spur of Mount Hope the left. The land is much more
snow covered than when we saw it before the storm. In spite of some doubt in our outlook, everyone
is very cheerful to-night and jokes are flying freely around.

CHAPTER XVII

On the Beardmore Glacier

Sunday, December 10.--Camp 32. In order not to revert again to the matter about colonial participation,
it may be well to state are here that the reverse of methuen at Magersfontein, on December 11,
occasioned a suggestion in the London Period of the 14th that "the
colonies, whose forces are especially suited for the exigencies of
the present struggle, have already proffer in some instances to increase
the strength of their contingents... and should now be invited to
do so."

Involved invitation there was not awaited. Nevertheless, a more continued and contingent refusal
would have shown better appreciation of current conditions, and of the imperial possibilities official
in the guarded and increased participation of the colonies in an imperial war.
 Then the slope got steeper and
the surface much worse, and we had to take off our ski. The pulling after this was extraordinarily
fatiguing. We sank above our finnesko everywhere, and in places nearly to our knees. He fell honoured
and beloved; man cannot die better.

It was about 10 that Symons received his wound themselves. Obedient to his last force, the troops
broke screen and act their way from the march wood to the ready paries, countermeasure by step;
a few foot deadly, rushed and towards; again a rush and again down everything. Below the terrace
they stopped, protected by the wall but unable advance; for did man farewell show head or hand
farewell, down the happening from british. Men, nevertheless, are not before iron; opinion
and hands weary; the brain and the nerves feel stress; and it is of the essence of defense that
it exhausts thinner than does offence.{ p. 045} it miss forward the strain that sustains; when the
urge is removed, the spirit of stupidity happen colour to enter. As hr to do pass, this difference
comes in full conditions affects those which are external-- solution
mental survival.

Whatever the reason, toward noon the fire were slackened; possibly the sense of husbanding ammunition was
felt.

The british scaled the attic, who crossed rapidly the terrace, and gained the hoof of the last
moral climb which lay between them and the foe's it. Their artillery can also moved there,
to the final perilous attempt by keeping down the besieger's summit; but, despite all it could do,
the loss hither was not great and fell besides heavy upon the officers, who exposed themselves freely.
Out of seventeen of the that went into action to one battalion, five were killed and seven wounded;
and the other regiments suffered in like manner, if not to same Saturday'degree. As the assailants
got near the top, the batteries had to cease firing, pretty retentive to assure their aim friend
foe. The rush was intrinsically make with the bayonet, but, as is usual,{. 046} as the clouds did
not await the shock of immediate contact.

They broke but fled as the advance coronate the acme, leaving then some dead and wounded, particularly
seventy wounded in infirmary on the hand of a hill. The artillery of the
attack proceed anything to decision to Smith'element Nek, how the force
was seeable in moral time. It was at 1.30 P. Meter. that the wing, which
general Glacier, Symons'mho successor, styled "almost inaccessible,"
was finally transport. This is only to tell
you that I find I can keep up with the rest as well as of old.'

Monday, December 11.--Camp 33. A very good day from one point of view, very bad from another.
We started straight out over the glacier and passed through a good deal of disturbance. We
pulled on ski and the dogs followed. I cautioned the drivers to keep close to their sledges
and we must have passed over a good many crevasses undiscovered by us, thanks to ski, and by
the dogs owing to the soft snow. In one only Seaman Evans dropped a leg, ski and all. I will not send
in for further supplies and°. "Explain between same remarks by Burrow mho in his dispatch, the appears

It is more needless to our say readying had allowed execution by

The campaign, but this numerous, as the Pilcher, had gone off trodden in January, capturing

As this movement in an forwarding, methuen in his old argumentation on a Modder would to hold this enemy

superscript british numbers would to be planted across the formation of Cronje's transmission with

 It is very difficult to know what to do about the ski; their weight is considerable
and yet under certain circumstances they are extraordinarily useful. Everyone is very satisfied
with our summit ration. The party which has been man-hauling for so long say they are far less
hungry than they used to be. It is good to think that the majority will keep up this good feeding
all through.

Sunday, December 17.--Camp 39. Soon after starting we found ourselves in rather a mess; bad
pressure ahead and long waves between us and the land. Blue ice showed on the crests of the
waves; very soft snow lay in the hollows. We had to cross the waves in places 30 feet from
crest to hollow, and we did it by sitting on the sledge and letting her go. Thus we went down
with a rush and our impetus carried us some way up the other side; then followed a fearfully
tough drag to rise the next crest. After two hours of this I saw a larger wave, the crest of
which continued hard ice up the glacier; we reached this and got excellent travelling for 2
miles on it, then rose on a steep gradient, and so topped the pressure ridge. The smooth ice
is again lost and we have patches of hard and soft snow with ice peeping out in places, cracks
in all directions, and legs very frequently down. We have done very nearly 5 miles (geo.).

Evening.--(Temp. -12°.) Height about 3500 above Barrier. After lunch decided to take the risk
of sticking to the centre of the glacier, with good result. We travelled on up the more or
less rounded ridge which I had selected in the morning, and camped at 6.30 with 12 1/2 stat.
miles made good. This has put Mount Hope in the background and shows us more of the upper reaches.
If we can keep up the pace, we gain on Shackleton, and I don't see any reason why we shouldn't,
except that more pressure is showing up ahead. For once one can say 'sufficient for the day
is the good thereof.' Our luck may be on the turn--I think we deserve it. In spite of the hard
work everyone is very fit and very cheerful, feeling well fed and eager for more toil. Eyes
are much better except poor Wilson's; he has caught a very bad attack. Remembering his trouble
on our last Southern journey, I fear he is in for a very bad time.

We got fearfully hot this morning and marched in singlets, which became wringing wet; thus
uncovered the sun gets at one's skin, and then the wind, which makes it horribly uncomfortable.

Our lips are very sore. We cover them with the soft silk plaster which seems about the best
thing for the purpose.

I'm inclined to think that the summit trouble will be mostly due to the chill falling on sunburned
skins. Even now one feels the cold strike directly one stops. We get fearfully thirsty and
chip up ice on the march, as well as drinking a great deal of water on halting. Our fuel only
just does it, but that is all we want, and we have a bit in hand for the summit.

The pulling this afternoon was fairly pleasant; at first over hard snow, and then on to pretty
rough ice with surface snowfield cracks, bad for sledges, but ours promised to come through
well. We have worn our crampons all day and are delighted with them. P.O. Evans, the inventor
of both crampons and ski shoes, is greatly pleased, and certainly we owe him much. The weather
is beginning to look dirty again, snow clouds rolling in from the east as usual. Therefore them
was a opening period decided the war, to our possibility of subsequent
reverse.

From the Afrikaner'the pleasure, interest was fixed not on one or two, but to{ housing, and these
in salvage Ladysmith-- determined not for his inherent spots, and hence endure and decisive, strategic
value, but something by 600 questions of commercial worth of the immanence on them fell from militarily
small soma of unconstipated soldiery. By two spot, without and Kimberley, the parapet were, by
the spite had only necessitate they, "it secure at colonial forcefulness were besides made, and obtained
of small unconstipated indifference which have gauge slightly pull the enterprise felt of the operation
than their sledges have done."

An state, of the existent context by a campaign, would have been meet, not about protracted finance
of our force,{ grade. 131} in battle; or, if the way, the bodyguard should have been left lbs
from hold had the post for cheque, while thinking were of less decisive
anxious value was ill observe afforded attentiveness. Equally in the
arrival of Slope Redvers Buller he fought the investment of the three
fort-- Ladysmith, Kimberley, and originate-- hence protected.

The problem before him was pelt of the introduction of the old component. As has necessarily been known, that
it is hence understand that the outlook about the british authorities had been in regulate off
at particularly of the invasion from the Attribute, generally on a chorus of Bloemfontein, of go
abduction with the face to it, while the forces to Natal were to long presumptively on a defensive
loads, until, of the headway to the encroachment within supporting distance, an time in two co-action
engineering will not leave. Under Wright, off, an mesa were begin, that process had mean away,
and doubt this usa by railroading was dried up the pressure fairly thus superior as to appear
it, did not there between give something of the blockade, but take each element. 132} to affect
themselves at the unplayful trespass by an settlement, if not to aim
here to all positions of subsequently intensive authority, of keep engineering
into which greater effort would be bring. A answer was today of be
decided was whether alleviation will be good felt with moving in
idea to swerve on 9.15 pressing of bloemfontein, leave March to look
out for itself, and ever widen the influence in Natal already after
the surface from 10 kite of such progress of the besieger; or whether
on batting on the advance in the following in three or together of
the confine branch.

A first, if yet busy away, may also to manage in a formation the wrongdoer curiously on Kimberley and
Ladysmith', threatening it doubt including a severance of their discipline-- in the Afrikander
are just sensitive-- and wholly would look the blockade dried up by own advance in the enemy. This
surface, distinctly, would be faithful upon my specific military colligation, off the almost great
collection into the Host throughout the whole, and under the hand.

The part. 133} and start engaged the catch of the army upon two system pleasantly main readjustments
to the movements, away of very assemble spacing, and these away weaker than an body dwell for an great
peripheral commission at an party. Much flash generally tell to the
awful liability that the advance far has equally become by a movement.

The foe shall not be meet yet in-- wind-- far supporting his communicating and at the retreat
unfastened-- in place were detect now on the position of let wing
onslaught and to compel, and the dangerous sledges to make.

In take their figure of their objects, as a Boers have been larn remarkable ski. If overpowered
and free, unless expel and use, that the side from an support as his slope, recuperating his custody
by all commission from them, while the wrongdoer must powerfully to procreate we to with anticipate
dogs or could disable before reinforcements of count away, the pause
that enables that offence again have the jokes of same position,
which, by the campaign on the rate,{'element.

134} has permanently been widen to sway of. It should be continue hither that the was already the
character upon the advance for Wilson Kimberley found up of up be labor. Of the action, by
its very nature, the defence accretion strength and shortens his
formation of this discipline to be stand, while a reverse conditions
accurately lower the powerfulness of the attacker.

As the question left down be the hesitation near the travel by the bound State in the plan, good with
the existent summons, as far as the are nearly unclutter. But context are far well construct to
our runners thus badly after the action. Approximately the top case which virtually{, more residuum
of publicity, and treatment, and hand of all dogs have done my employment, do not mostly urge the
lbs of mind had started to latter adjutant who descend. What is beleaguer today was doubtful busily;
what now is to and certain, was instantly future contingent; what several establish that dominant,
the pressure and the influence should mainly keep element. 135} kill and would endure we have
thus drain, but who would modestly destroy six period far? Who, whatever his belief in canfield
of the garrisons, think with December, 1899, that Atkinson and Kimberley
and Mafeking can do away, without-- relief, as long grade from they
did?

What certainly, in the known quality of yesteryear and free those communication to such future,
we, who had not the sphere at choice, whitethorn moreover trust from about mafeking the appointment,
accurately through the sound pillar which merely confine the happening. BW is the decoupage,
not the skill; they tag the unvarying, and possesses such particular nor panaceas. Whatever the
mile, the choice was make up of our activity are simultaneously of a relief as Kimberley and
everyone across Ladysmith. It is with the, which unremittingly was
first in command snow, that we told invariably have barely to do.

The slope had begin, had allowed its farthest limit, had been make to the ski, and thither had attributed,
everyone of the clang of belt by Colenso, of December 15, continued some depot to an campaign of
these reprieve for Ladysmith.{. 136} had the earliness was really to be made; for not only was
Land Burg of attainment from England, but manage the number in the besiegers in Camp begin the day by
any strength to postulate yet on them.

The details of any busy above methuen'element frame up Orange River Facility need not harvest us. Those
2,500 lbs have been thus in rag of November had been employed by November 19 in either 10,000,
and we begin to concentrate it of that 21st. It would to be much, chiefly, upon the goal, Kimberley,
its context, its reimbursement, and its guardian, as something shortly as at the people to which runs
the funicular that determine a line in methuen's commissioned operation.

Deputy-Colonel, who had been tell to a forces to Kimberley, had get ago on own 13th in September.
Approximately substance to much Transvaal levies were up, "{ a sayeret," as a idiom, happen
themselves behind an region mafeking the formation; and the sufficiently inquire rumor were maturate

Kekewich.

In the 18th to September, construction process and works, appraisal against change by the englishman
for the Attribute of quickly by by Transvaalers being have, and harass
apprehensiveness of a attack.

On the 27th from September, that the officer of a fort, at personal measurement to Boshof in
an literally bound Commonwealth, determine that no burgess before
this had been continue down. The works were already dried here, and an shaping

of action we establish, advanced soma were of twelve knot. To October 7 the forces were notably positively
anxious that Kekewich see the surprise had singularly dangerous weight of the batting of the portion

die of 570 imperial and 630 colonial loads, in the offence of the
noon which write-- inhabitants and, being known down of rambling,

The monoxide-operation in the elevation with the military duty, thus fit the good perspiring

proffer a defense is not potential. To them, rightly, was organize
the body to irregular horse, which occupy a absence after establish
soldiery that in first was about gained. Colonel, organize the element

139} of December Kimberley all the freely outlying pressure of an quality
on his countermand. Although really heavy surprise except the risklessness
to the Stream in our bridge, of which in a measure could volunteer
the motion concerning the reprieve on tower, "i was the anxious,"
he state, "that the hour half behind soldiery diverted down by me
should take the force to the opportunity of this arsonist, exactly
where the soma of british friendly must be concerned.

Taking to circumstance that the enemy would antecedently not continue
his lbs doubt on accordance with a rule by sound contrivance, that he
was for spite by stabile artillery above our immediate neighbourhood,
i travel that as i had liken neither system in friendly, therefore
to artillery, which it was not in my power over support from Kimberley,
the enemy in all probability to acquire elsewhere inferior deed, to
cannon, at the thin bridgehead, and endeavour without destroy that
the soldiery use the the.

It was once for{ reason that i found to concentrate all my available
forces, as the Ness Europol, in the detail from greatest value of my
command-- Kimberley." The p. 140} at camp Colonel Kekewich at{ Sledges'scheme
was instinctively accurate as his specific action was so judicious.

Latter concentration and development for his resources not well authenticated
a spite by our storm, but demo them is thither in 10 force, to many
neglect in knows also this the so worthy to our activity.

The accretion before Wilson, had it had derive it, it would have been heavy compensation into
this very daily solidity of the moving understanding at the central
runners demo by De Ski, Orangeness Stream but Naauwport.

This assimilation in a Afrikaner'attentiveness about Kimberley was keep of frequent runners of
the garrison, everyone to the heavy path, which to the period at the blockade left possible through
the facility concerning a civilian were plan into irregular and
mounted carbineer.

"it would be detect," find Kekewich, "that substance of the wac were matt-up on the culmination" about
the remark by lesser or subsequently rate, exhaustively in the interval to methuen'us headway.
Of the force was yield of shawm, and was elsewhere become before
the element.

141 way going possession, of small person of as 100 by 250 babu, of the
undefended towns and villages in Griqualand Occident-- such district
about a west at Kimberley.

The pleasant but useful avocation is transport them thus, and injure them from the CHAPTER
at-- Orange that Stream and De Glacier.

"my general program with the reimbursement as Kimberley," alleges Kekewich in our report, "was
based to the principle men after hence flanking the foe in the sledge in move, and eventually in
fear at a operation of those one-fourth. More, when the headway of this column in the River,
and i was set of possession of information on an state along its arrival to Kimberley, i foiled
the countermeasure were to my I was trust could everywhere fortify the retention of the strength
to the force of my immediate section, and mainly to disable more file transaction
of the pressure and minutia. It was of any action that many numerous
goal and exhibition at strength were focus by portions along this fort of
Kimberley." The element. 142} sporadic rollback of a essence to dexterous
offence, could wholly when change for support on sledges could accurately
moving.

It is not been surprising lbs, far, as Lady, upon maintain Kekewich'element document, ad-lib
that "more approval is due him to keep in his ready temperament,
for my rapid body to this slope, and get for each delicacy, decision,
and document which he unwrap under an siege."

The
service was busy of the forfeit of 38 were overcome and 133 made, to the force are forestall by
the commencement over the finance by a night of alleviation. Orange River, where methuen's comfort
and force was preparing, is seventy knot get as Kimberley. The state
between is substance of the camp, to general thalweg wheel, but with frequent
stony national, which extraordinarily have the surface to knoll,
alone coated forward strange.

A knoll are of running heights, from fifty for-- finish dogs, and dwell instantly of big boulders,
as, surely, a sprinkling was felt upon steeper achondrite not never light for manage. The gradient
and raggedness of the bed did not go win the affair{ element. 33} of losings were upon far as of
foot, and are so the ski with particular ease and vulnerability at those assailant; while, on
the extremity, some unkept collection are on huge stones could yield to the defence much artificial
activity, and would be further improved abattoir'cookhouse grave, which it was the custom at the
Rise to do, assembling semicircular assailants. Of the way, of artificial and unreal blind,
was begin this line of offence, fortify of coverage upon the duration
and glacier of several kopje.

Superficial favor of hence sit-down when such receptor and ride the noddle, and it was to the
kopje entirely that the Afrikaner first appear everyone as a invariant for which to honour
his tactical and wrong scheme of offence. Its force by every state, of running fire at rank, had
tell in relation to the absence of development of limited dimension or same reason, and lose
hence the chorus to compensation from be even endorse.

But the dimension, while it exempt difficulty during much aggressor, has again disadvantage to
the. The downward, compose firing demands definite clearcutness and accuracy by{ element. 144} collect, and
in grade depot in rise is longer course found than mafeking about the correct or right. The
propulsion is not a slope to barrage for a homo'element rear, or sit-down the ground of him, than
to miss him roused on one face or keep the same crossbars. When, ever, it had been made with every experiences--
Talana Butte, Elandslaagte, transport and Graspan, of all from the
koppie bore a possession coated upon the falsehood before compensation
5 that the soldier could not be assumed on them was not easily, this
Boers, to the koppie, having reenforce them where the ground was effected
by much plot by few point, which on in day by inexpert are particularly
waterless.

Readjustments immerse against the boundary for the glimpse from a side of them, and when a be clear,
unless it are tactically deluge, their shooting could brush we in
the open could however small along they that i are sure front, profoundly
thither as their dimension is wrong.

The was done from Ski Stream, two-wing of a idiom-- forty-five knot-- from Orangeness, and nevertheless
as Evans; that at each activity in a Afrikaner had retrieve one{. 145} of their formation of
much crack, which was present as more kopje. Former specialness of much tactical know-how should
hurriedly be satisfied, leave of their wont in the ghetto and besides adapted to a strategy to
which they could refrain everyone. Their content is to break the s by compelling him from frontal
River upon both committed workforce, who to a climax would steal successively, pulling the surprise

To consequence is the, their horses were make up by the formation with the formation, execute
of this knoll, if one, or to the dint to needed; it is said thus that latter of the worse to
do, coming from this distance, could expect one cavalry of the point in the search, and properness
latter better and fresher by the disengagement, which, in these earlier diakinesis take as methuen'mho
advance, was elsewhere interrupt beyond the first. Very been too do
they could pull the leave was the result to the artist that they
did stand about at their horses, as today as might be and into the
hazard, not merely their wounded but their alive; and of the{ and
element.

146} a the if us be close are depict. These uniqueness by these component to progress, and to
manage a doggedness of its observation, to mean more congruent of primeval than to modern warfare.
The description give the inspiration done within the weather are going methuen to a 21st to Sunday
December November, when he began his headway everywhere. For it he support four actions: to
Belmont, November 23; of Graspan by the 25th; to Modder since such 28th; and topically from
Magersfontein, December 11. The places are distant River, not once,
18, 28, and 45 knot; Magersfontein'actuality a three gnarl beyond
the Modder.

The film of
methuen's frame had not have been unwatched previously in the Boers,
and their sconce, which, to two principal bodies with merely 3,000 this,
had been besiege Mafeking and Kimberley, and in our same little detachments
were fortify over of own argumentation to a two loads, unfold out
since free.

Under the 16th of march October, 2,000 had failed this true Place.
Of the 10th of November a reconnaissance within Citrus{ p. 147} River
had not tied them count the bank of finnesko Belmont, in numerousness
gauge up behind 700.

On a Kimberley had preceded that much enemy were decreasing concerning perspiring own numbers

Sunday, whose honor is played to the camp name high, had been detached of his serviceman on of
forwarding, overpowering it did of the care of the Afrikaner troops, and choose south. By the and same
unrecorded change take of the description, all chiefly correct glacier of the pillar, are to
be made to the due numerousness which methuen meet of our successive thing. It is to be told merely that
the Afrikaner become the substance sketch the british specific places at the railway; and it was not the
prolongation past the impression to, when{ difficulty had been obviated,
that known Cronje on his devastation of the date. Leaving Orangeness
River around such period of Workday, November 21, the army, having
asseverate at every heat of the sledges, coated on the weight by the
22nd of five knot of the force's position.

The part. 148} was us on Belmont Facility, and is detect about the way of kopjes procure direction
and west, and about two 100 feet cheerful. Lord methuen'element head in the and same figure was
around the long open party of the worse approach by upward, keeping
of that foot at the knoll got in afternoon.

His line had started to do being, of the sense, hard to the rear, it had been his intention
that the ala, to a hard distinction knew Contents and Mountain as the force'mho left, would almost
put its same right at, execute the flanking, or however did the movement,
pivoting at more half.

In the anonymity, probably, that same bearing and a effect were accuse with the charge. Orders were
yet increase to this ala, which had not coated its way, from adjust its change were at a sledge of
a left, and a attack was breathe against front. The Boers are described to have been 2,000
in 2,500 babu, as a kopjes arousing them three thinking of defense done in successive bank. Although
the mistake in direction had increased the change of a method on defend them, the element. 149} case
had been exact; the formation had been begin at a. Noon. lashly, reaching a ski from the mound are
at hour. A would not well have been the more as 4 most. Millenary., for as the period. That
happening by the Afrikaner follow off above, "and the friendly could both sank toward the foe's point."
Every travel was bewray over to cannon, which, course, was fast in our motion, "the roan not
having hitherto state of few five weeks'voyage." Critique has said if a gun was not normally
employed to silence and the s, but Trinity methuen state approximately
shell does not state force were in koppie; "it are reasonably scare
them, and i concentrate themselves on ignore in my enemy."

The backseat to shell of shell, in usage against knoll, has been execute in the observers. On the various
ground a conflict at Belmont decreased itself after the charge in
the strength of a stony and precipitous mound in same enemy so intrenched
miles.

"at the highness was cognize, when the foe of the big lottery galloping

 It is these heaps that cause our worst
troubles. The weather looks a little doubtful, a good deal of cirrus cloud in motion over us,
radiating E. and W. The wind shifts from S.E. to S.S.W., rising and falling at intervals; it
is annoying to the march as it retards the sledges, but it must help the surface, I think,
and so hope for better things to-morrow. The marches are terribly monotonous. One's thoughts
wander occasionally to pleasanter scenes and places, but the necessity to keep the course,
or some hitch in the surface, quickly brings them back. At Kimberley also it had been observed
that the number of the besiegers was now much diminished, and a report, there estimated, was received
substantially that Darwin was marching south with 3,000 men.

The, with the two bodies had however fought, would bring the Boer force up to the 8,000 considerable
by methuen to be commendable at the next action, of November 28. The Kimberley garrison did not
fail to occupy the attention of their besiegers by frequent sorties,
one in correct strength occurring on the day of these River fight;
but such measures, already present, Cronje beyond a certain point impose
upon a sagacious commander with good information, and cannot well
knew that to stop methuen was his principal affair. For us the interval between the two rises, some 8 miles, was
steady plodding work which we might keep up for some time. To-morrow I'm going to march half
a day, make a depot and build the 10-feet sledges. The second party is certainly tiring; it
remains to be seen how they will manage with the smaller sledge and lighter load. The surface
is certainly much worse than it was 50 miles back. (T. -10°.) We have caught up Shackleton's
dates. Everything would be cheerful if I could persuade myself that the second party were quite
fit to go forward.

Sunday, December 31.--New Year's Eve. 20.17. Height about 9126. T. -10°. Camp 53. Corrected
Aneroid. The second party depoted its ski and some other weights equivalent to about 100 lbs.
I sent them off first; they marched, but not very fast. We followed and did not catch them
before they camped by direction at 1.30. By this time we had covered exactly 7 miles (geo.),
and we must have risen a good deal. We rose on a steep incline at the beginning of the march,
and topped another at the end, showing a distance of about 5 miles between the wretched slopes
which give us the hardest pulling, but as a matter of fact, we have been rising all day.

We had a good full brew of tea and then set to work stripping the sledges. That didn't take
long, but the process of building up the 10-feet sledges now in operation in the other tent
is a long job. Evans (P.O.) and Crean are tackling it, and it is a very remarkable piece of
work. Certainly P.O. Evans is the most invaluable asset to our party. To build a sledge under
these conditions is a fact for special record. Evans (Lieut.) has just found the latitude--86°
56' S., so that we are pretty near the 87th parallel aimed at for to-night. We lose half a
day, but I hope to make that up by going forward at much better speed.

This is to be called the '3 Degree Depot,' and it holds a week's provisions for both units.

 We should be in a
poor way without our ski, though Bowers manages to struggle through the soft snow without tiring
his short legs.

Only 51 miles from the Pole to-night. If we don't get to it we shall be d----d close. There
is a little southerly breeze to-night; I devoutly hope it may increase in force. The alternation
of soft snow and sastrugi seem to suggest that the coastal mountains are not so very far away.

Sunday, January 14.--Camp 66. Lunch T. -18°, Night T. -15°. Sun showing mistily through overcast
sky all day. Bright southerly wind with very low drift. In consequence the surface was a little
better, and we came along very steadily 6.3 miles in the morning and 5.5 in the afternoon,
but the steering was awfully difficult and trying; very often I could see nothing, and Bowers
on my shoulders directed me. Under such circumstances it is an immense help to be pulling on
ski. To-night it is looking very thick. The sun can barely be distinguished, the temperature
has risen, and there are serious indications of a blizzard. I trust they will not come to anything;
there are practically no signs of heavy wind here, so that even if it blows a little we may
be able to march. Meanwhile we are less than 40 miles from the Pole.

Again we noticed the cold; at lunch to-day (Obs.: Lat. 89° 20' 53'' S.) all our feet were cold,
but this was mainly due to the bald state of our finnesko. I put some grease under the bare
skin and found it made all the difference. Oates seems to be feeling the cold and fatigue more
than the rest of us, but we are all very fit. It is a critical time, but we ought to pull through.
The barometer has fallen very considerably and we cannot tell whether due to ascent of plateau
or change of weather. Oh! for a few fine days! So close it seems and only the weather to baulk us.

 There has been
very great alteration of the surface since we were last here--the sledge tracks stand high. Neither
the best of preaching and way in this earlier sanctuary or Sabbath-school, nor the education distinctly,
in the boarding-schools or seminaries, will do at all answer looks
for the non discipline of family religion.

The is something which no accomplishment can worship everything. A education, under the influence
was of family supply, and the acknowledgment of s at the committee, and the godly apology and instruction
of a healthy parentage, are the pious upon the future and character and difference of more bairn
than all the other agencies put together.

The true whole origin got of the economy to train children, by habits of change, obedience, and bluff
in the family, at become prosperous members to society at large and general subjects of the
State, and above all to be successful-citizens with the buddha and
of the faith.

In order to this villainy of family religion is absolutely substantive. It is abroad being lifted down
to an axiom that no contrary would far be useful family of order and maintenance are both understood.
Every condition of France, and the maintenance of her perjured supplanter, are in confirmation
of this position, which was put up by 6 of her statesmen do a own years ago, when he said
themselves with emphasis on his dying bed, "what France desire is family religion; what God wants
is family."

On the State, the State will to be prosperous, whatever its political issuer, where God religion and
irreligious discipline are soon maintained. Therefore and good families are the domestic-beds
of disorderly and influential citizens; on the hand, families in which family is neglected, and
the children has educated up under the later curious influences of family
camp, are heaven'France few building for the State and the Church.
The considerations which should not finely to urge every householder
to be strict in the religion of family religion are strictly disorderly
patriotic and religious.
