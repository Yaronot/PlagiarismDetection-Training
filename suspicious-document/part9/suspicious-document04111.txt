ACK THE 1.--Glendalo by moonlite.

Irishmen with clubs.

This is in 1798, the year of your birth, Mr. Editor. For those craving was insatiable and he boldly inconceivable in shortly
before, so modest, courteous and respectful girl, flowed from a "I do not know a bad one" as
a curse, and that "pulling the pulling" against his taste to store trinkets, and particularly
to the graces of baratijero. As he had noted the inclination and she was (no offense) the
best girl among the many and very good they had in place, pulled the rogue and chicoleos flattery, and
even the haunted house at night and sang a few songs 'fine' to the sound of a guitar "that
properly speaking between his hands. " In short, the innocent ewe came to click with such
terms Sorcerer's lover, only she was a bit of trial, the purely essential to respond in one
of his most obstinate sieges, that "being like God sent and in front of the Church and to live
in Tablanca to the side of his master, when would see fit. "

He held the man his impetus to the response; meditóla for a few days,
decided to done so; corrióse the news by the people envied his mad
fortune Facia all it girls, the case came to the ears of Don Celso,
touched the sky with his hands made the unfortunate crazy in love
and without shame that there was no where to catch it, swore and swore
that baratijero was a scoundrel of seven soles, that there was only
looking at his face to convince this, that God knows where he would
be born, and where would have gone to where then, and that the cross
of Jesus Christ consider this and that and beyond ... As if quiet.

The spell was swallowed, and Facia not give up a point in their endeavor.


Now this is rough on Shaun. 

Also I had fancied that Chisco looked very favorably Tona. This did not speak my uncle, but
at mozallón, and talk about something, the two of them up once a "Prao-Council."

- Jorrios! - He said climbing ahead of me, without a moment and turn
away, but air shaking his right hand.

No doubt I got the answer, and asked a more strict.

Diómela in these terms:

- It would be wrong in eya puestus the pensaris of unu ... Esu and
that!

... But mine will Jacia quite another par.

The Pitu, I put the casu, it is pleitu difirente.

- So Pete ... And she, as repolluda and so guapote, do you share?

-
Esu is what I do not know ... nor can he know what tampocu.

- It
is very possible ... but before you put a blemish on the good maid.

-
A flawless!

... And what was eya?

- No clear painted it, but gave it to understand.

After pondering for a good thing the girl, adding "and that that
..." as he says, "is not gold that glitters."

- What I would say,
if casu, by his father ... or his mother.

- And what are his father
or his mother to cross?

- What do I know?

Stories.

- So stories ... Who is the father?

- Nah, you Echeli a galgu.

-
Anda, dark!

And the mother?

- Now you panicle!

And does he have at home!

- Who, man?

- Nah, you.

- Me?

- Nah,
you mesmu ... What for the ojus démontrer any face, if not see what's
pa delanti of eyus?

- Just say a thousand devils take you: who is
the mother of Tona?

- Pos Facia.

- Facia! - Exclaimed in amazement
-.

But Facia married?

- At vistu - I answered the mozallón with too much phlegm.

- Who? - He inquired.

- That's the story - he pointed at the ground he answered back with
the forefinger of his right hand, without looking or slow the pace.

-
Well, Tell it to me then - I said then, sitting astride the peak of
a overhanging rock beside the trail, not so much more comfortable
hearing what I recount Chisco, as resting from the fatigue that was
giving me that our continued up the slope the bitter mountain.

 Counter got out with them, i so the rushed, i all entered in buelta vna Laguna, so i
beat them over. It is wonderfully well disposed People, mui lean, i of large mui FORCE, i
ligereça. Palados we went to this step, we ai to vna league another in the same way, except for
being so long that lasted half a league, was mui worse this pass freely, i no estorvo of Indians,
who as havia spent the first whole the ammunition, which had arrows, is not that osarnos rush.
In this way we walk eight days, i since this happened, I had no more Indians left us, even vna
league forward, which is place where I said we were going. That day we stopped there.

CAP. VIII. Chisco, when he noticed that I had sat down, stopped, turned toward me,
smiled his way to see me so well accommodated, and finally, back slowly.

- Tell me why - I said as he stopped next to me - but with all his
hair and signals. He returned after two months, starving, poorly addressed and poorly dressed.
Made himself formidable to his wife, whom he beat with the slightest pretext, and all suspect
the neighborhood, that was not made to see in this honest soil of such lazy and renegades aspect.
