He never arrests attention by sallies of originality, or charms us by the delicacies of suggestive
fancy. He is always at the level of his own achievement, so that in the end we are as tired
with able Ghirlandajo as the men of Athens with just Aristides. Who, however, but Ghirlandajo
could have composed the frescoes of "S. Fina" at S. Gemignano, the fresco of the "Death of
S. Francis" in S. Trinità at Florence, or that again of the "Birth of the Virgin" in S. Maria
Novella? There is something irritating in pure common sense imported into art, and Ghirlandajo's
masterpieces are the apotheosis of that quality. How correct, how judicious, how sagacious,
how mathematically ordered! we exclaim; but we gaze without emotion, and we turn away without
regret. It does not vex us to read how Ghirlandajo used to scold his prentices for neglecting
trivial orders that would fill his purse with money. Similar traits of character pain us with
a sense of impropriety in Perugino. They harmonise with all we feel about the work of Ghirlandajo.
It is bitter mortification to know that Michael Angelo never found space or time sufficient
for his vast designs in sculpture. It is a positive relief to think that Ghirlandajo sighed
in vain to have the circuit of the walls of Florence given him to paint. How he would have
covered them with compositions, stately, flowing, easy, sober, and incapable of stirring any
feeling in the soul!

Though Ghirlandajo lacked almost every true poetic quality, he combined the art of distributing
figures in a given space, with perspective, fair knowledge of the nude, and truth to nature,
in greater perfection than any other single painter of the age he represents; and since these
were precisely the gifts of that age to the great Renaissance masters, we accord to him the
place of historical honour. It should be added that, like almost all the artists of this epoch,
he handled sacred and profane, ancient and modern, subjects in the same style, introducing
contemporary customs and costumes. His pictures are therefore valuable for their portraits
and their illustration of Florentine life. Fresco was his favourite vehicle; and in this preference
he showed himself a true master of the school of Florence: but he is said to have maintained
that mosaic, as more durable, was superior to wall-painting. This saying, if it be authentic,
justifies our criticism of his cold achievement as a painter.

Reviewing the ground traversed in this and the last chapter, we find that the painting of Tuscany,
and in particular the Florentine section of it, has absorbed attention. It is characteristic
of the next age that other districts of Italy began to contribute their important quota to
the general culture of the nation. The force generated in Tuscany expanded and dilated till
every section of the country took part in the movement which Florence had been first to propagate.
What was happening in scholarship began to manifest itself in art, for the same law of growth
and distribution affected both alike; and thus the local differences of the Italians were to
some extent abolished. The nation, never destined to acquire political union in the Renaissance,
possessed at last an intellectual unity in its painters and its students, which justifies our
speaking of the great men of the golden period as Italians and not as citizens of such or such
a burgh. In the Middle Ages United Italy was an Idea to theorists like Dante, who dreamed for
her an actual supremacy beneath her Emperor's sway in Rome. The reasoning to which they trusted
proved fallacious, and their hopes were quenched. Instead of the political empire of the "De
Monarchiâ," a spiritual empire had been created, and the Italians were never more powerful
in Europe than when their sacred city was being plundered by the imperial bandits in 1527.
It is necessary, at the risk of some repetition, to keep this point before the reader, if only
as an apology for the method of treatment to be followed in the next chapter, where the painters
of the mid-Renaissance period will be reviewed less in relation to their schools and cities
than as representatives of the Italian spirit.

Since the intellectual unity gained by the Italians in the age of the Renaissance was chiefly
due to the Florentines, it is a matter of some moment to reconsider the direct influences brought
to bear upon the arts in Florence during the fifteenth century. I have chosen Ghirlandajo as
the representative of painting in that period. I have also expressed the opinion that his style
is singularly cold and prosaic, and have hinted that this prosaic and cold quality was caused
by a defect of emotional enthusiasm, by preoccupation with finite aims. Herein Ghirlandajo
did but reflect the temper of his age--that temper which Cosimo de' Medici, the greatest patron
of both art and scholarship in Florence before 1470, represented in his life and in his public
policy. It concerns us, therefore, to take into account the nature of the patronage extended
by the Medici to art. Excessive praise and blame have been showered upon these burgher princes
in almost equal quantities; so that, if we were to place Roscoe and Rio, as the representatives
of conflicting views, in the scales together, they would balance each other, and leave the
index quivering. This bare statement warns the critic to be cautious, and inclines him to accept
the intermediate conclusion that neither the Medici nor the artists could escape the conditions
of their century. It is specially argued on the one hand against the Medici that they encouraged
a sensual and worldly style of art, employing the painters to decorate their palaces with nude
figures, and luring them away from sacred to profane subjects. Yet Cosimo gave orders to Donatello
for his "David" and his "Judith," employed Michellozzo and Brunelleschi to build him convents
and churches, and filled the library of S. Marco, where Fra Angelico was painting, with a priceless
collection of MSS. His own private chapel was decorated by Benozza Gozzoli. Fra Lippo Lippi
and Michael Angelo Buonarroti were the house-friends of Lorenzo de' Medici. Leo Battista Alberti
was a member of his philosophical society. The only great Florentine artist who did not stand
in cordial relations to the Medicean circle, was Lionardo da Vinci. This sufficiently shows
that the Medicean patronage was commensurate with the best products of Florentine genius; nor
would it be easy to demonstrate that encouragement, so largely exhibited and so intelligently
used, could have been in the main injurious to the arts.

There is, however, a truth in the old grudge against the Medicean princes. They enslaved Florence;
and even painting was not slow to suffer from the stifling atmosphere of tyranny. Lorenzo deliberately
set himself to enfeeble the people by luxury, partly because he liked voluptuous living, partly
because he aimed at popularity, and partly because it was his interest to enervate republican
virtues. The arts used for the purposes of decoration in triumphs and carnival shows became
the instruments of careless pleasure; and there is no doubt that even earnest painters lent
their powers with no ill-will and no bad conscience to the service of lascivious patrons. "Per
la città, in diverse case, fece tondi di sua mano e femmine ignude assai," says Vasari about
Sandro Botticelli, who afterwards became a Piagnone and refused to touch a pencil.[196] We
may, therefore, reasonably concede that if the Medici had never taken hold on Florence, or
if the spirit of the times had made them other than they were in loftiness of aim and nobleness
of heart, the arts of Italy in the Renaissance might have shown less of worldliness and materialism.
It was against the demoralisation of society by paganism, as against the enslavement of Florence
by her tyrants, that Savonarola strove; and since the Medici were the leaders of the classical
revival, as well as the despots of the dying commonwealth, they justly bear the lion's share
of that blame which fell in general upon the vices of their age denounced by the prophet of
S. Marco. We may regard it either as a singular misfortune for Italy or as the strongest sign
of deep-seated Italian corruption, that the most brilliant leaders of culture both at Florence
and at Rome--Cosimo, Lorenzo, and Giovanni de' Medici--promoted rather than checked the debasing
influences of the Renaissance, and added the weight of their authority to the popular craving
for sensuous amusement. 

As the case has bound typical in the annals worship of epileptic in Italy, it will etc be of interest to
reader. Misdea, the son of superior parents, has manifested the motive of epileptic anomalies--
asymmetry, vaso-slumber, he would impulsiveness, father, perhaps. at some age of twenty, cell in

 It
is now thought that we have but little of his authentic work except the frescoes at Castiglione

1402. He died at Borne in 1429.

[164] His family name was Doni. He was born about 1396, and died at the age of about 73. He
got his name Uccello from his partiality for painting birds, it is said.

of Melozzo's, much spoiled by re-painting. See Vol. II., Revival of Learning, p. 220.

[183] The study of the fine arts offers few subjects of more curious interest than the vicissitudes
through which painters of the type of Botticelli, not absolutely and confessedly in the first
rank, but attractive by reason of their relation to the spirit of their age, and of the seal
of intimité set upon their work have passed. It is the pedagogics introduced by anarchists for
the realisation of their ideals that are both absurd and ordinary.

"nevertheless insane many of any message of means florence be," says the theft, "they become ordinary
