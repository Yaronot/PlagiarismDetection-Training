Even before these converts were baptized, Mr. Trainer started teaching them about the Church.
He taught them that they were indwelt by the Holy Spirit. He led them daily to the Throne of
Grace, and from the beginning they learned to pray. He encouraged in them the desire to win
others of their own households and their friends. He encouraged them to witness, both in their
own group, and to those who did not know Christ. He encouraged them to bring others to the
little evening gathering, and then to testify in front of these whom they had brought. He did
not make too many concrete suggestions, but prayed, and waited for the Holy Spirit to suggest
ways and means of witnessing to them. Soon he was invited to their homes to talk to others
in their families about the Lord. He always made such occasions an opportunity for the one
who invited him there to speak, asking for that one's personal testimony, as well as speaking
himself. Sometimes others of the group went along, and they too had a chance to testify. Then
it came about quite naturally that the little informal evening meeting was held in the different
homes, rather than always in that of Mr. Trainer. Soon different ones were taking turns leading,
with spontaneous testimonies, or sharing of "wonderful thoughts" from the Word that came to
them in their own private devotions. They would tell about opportunities they had to witness
for the Lord, and there would be prayer all around for the requests brought before the group. How
Oswald be is a street-- soon for manna, on he labor not neither did
not span he did, and if he steal he did for church because he was
not from young.

So all the turf-patch and the sentries on the qui vive.


Although he was eager to start street meetings, Mr. Trainer did not want this to be his own
personal effort, but rather a church effort. So he restrained himself and said nothing, but
prayed constantly about the matter. What was his joy when one day one of them asked, "Couldn't
we have a meeting somewhere where more people would come, and we could preach the Gospel to
them?" When no one seemed to be able to think of a building both suitable and available, he
permitted himself to make a suggestion about open-air meetings he had attended. Never having
heard of such a thing, some were doubtful, others amazed. He answered questions about how such
meetings were run, but made no recommendation. He heard no more about the subject for a week
or two, and then suddenly the whole group (who had been consulting together, it seemed) came
to him, eager to have an open-air meeting, with his assistance. Careful preparations were made,
musical instruments some of them had were requisitioned, and the first street meeting was held.
Although no actual decisions for Christ were made, a good crowd listened, and the Christians
were so pleased that from that day the open-air meeting became a regular thing.

Trying to witness or bring a short Gospel message in these meetings brought home to the young
Christians their need for more Bible study, so a regular Bible study class was instituted two
nights a week, instead of the usual meeting for testimony and prayer. At first they concentrated
on helping the speakers prepare their messages for the next street meeting. He has given of methods
