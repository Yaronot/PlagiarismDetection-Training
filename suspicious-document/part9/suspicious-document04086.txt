"I see it all," said Oldbuck, "as plain as the legend on a medal of high preservation—the box
in which the' bullion was found belonged to the gun-brig, and the treasure to my phoenix?"—(Edie
nodded assent),—"and was buried there that Sir Arthur might receive relief in his difficulties?"

"By me," said Edie, "and twa o' the brig's men—but they didna ken its contents, and thought
it some bit smuggling concern o' the Captain's. I watched day and night till I saw it in the
right hand; and then, when that German deevil was glowering at the lid o' the kist (they liked
mutton weel that licked where the yowe lay), I think some Scottish deevil put it into my head
to play him yon ither cantrip. Now, ye see, if I had said mair or less to Bailie Littlejohn,
I behoved till hae come out wi' a' this story; and vexed would Mr. Lovel hae been to have it
brought to light—sae I thought I would stand to onything rather than that."

"I must say he has chosen his confidant well," said Oldbuck, "though somewhat strangely."

"I'll say this for mysell, Monkbarns," answered the mendicant, "that I am the fittest man in
the haill country to trust wi' siller, for I neither want it, nor wish for it, nor could use
it if I had it. 1-- interpolated large hat-trimming shop.

"The blood o' your sister's son," replied Edie, "was on his hands, and him maybe dead outright—what
time had he to take counsel?—or how could he ask it of you, by onybody?"

"You are right. But what if Dousterswivel had come before you?"

"There was little fear o' his coming there without Sir Arthur: he had gotten a sair gliff the
night afore, and never intended to look near the place again, unless he had been brought there
sting and ling. He ken'd weel the first pose was o' his ain hiding, and how could he expect
a second? He just havered on about it to make the mair o' Sir Arthur."

"Then how," said Oldbuck, "should Sir Arthur have come there unless the German had brought him?"

"Umph!" answered Edie drily. "I had a story about Misticot wad hae brought him forty miles,
or you either. Besides, it was to be thought he would be for visiting the place he fand the
first siller in—he ken'd na the secret o' that job. In short, the siller being in this shape,
Sir Arthur in utter difficulties, and Lovel determined he should never ken the hand that helped
him,—for that was what he insisted maist upon,—we couldna think o' a better way to fling the
gear in his gate, though we simmered it and wintered it e'er sae lang. And if by ony queer
mischance Doustercivil had got his claws on't, I was instantly to hae informed you or the Sheriff
o' the haill story."

"Well, notwithstanding all these wise precautions, I think your contrivance succeeded better
than such a clumsy one deserved, Edie. But how the deuce came Lovel by such a mass of silver
ingots?"

"That's just what I canna tell ye—But they were put on board wi' his things at Fairport, it's
like, and we stowed them into ane o' the ammunition-boxes o' the brig, baith for concealment
and convenience of carriage."

"Lord!" said Oldbuck, his recollection recurring to the earlier part of his acquaintance with
Lovel; "and this young fellow, who was putting hundreds on so strange a hazard, I must be recommending
a subscription to him, and paying his bill at the Ferry! I never will pay any person's bill
again, that's certain.—And you kept up a constant correspondence with Lovel, I suppose?"

"I just gat ae bit scrape o' a pen frae him, to say there wad, as yesterday fell, be a packet
at Tannonburgh, wi' letters o' great consequence to the Knockwinnock folk; for they jaloused
the opening of our letters at Fairport—And that's a's true; I hear Mrs. Mailsetter is to lose
her office for looking after other folk's business and neglecting her ain."

"And what do you expect now, Edie, for being the adviser, and messenger, and guard, and confidential
person in all these matters?"

"Deil haet do I expect—excepting that a' the gentles will come to the gaberlunzie's burial;
and maybe ye'll carry the head yoursell, as ye did puir Steenie Mucklebackit's.—What trouble
was't to me? I was ganging about at ony rate—Oh, but I was blythe when I got out of Prison,
though; for I thought, what if that weary letter should come when I am closed up here like
an oyster, and a' should gang wrang for want o't? and whiles I thought I maun mak a clean breast
and tell you a' about it; but then I couldna weel do that without contravening Mr. Lovel's
positive orders; and I reckon he had to see somebody at Edinburgh afore he could do what he
wussed to do for Sir Arthur and his family."

"Well, and to your public news, Edie—So they are still coming are they?"

"Troth they say sae, sir; and there's come down strict orders for the forces and volunteers
to be alert; and there's a clever young officer to come here forthwith, to look at our means
o' defence—I saw the Bailies lass cleaning his belts and white breeks—I gae her a hand, for
ye maun think she wasna ower clever at it, and sae I gat a' the news for my pains."

"And what think you, as an old soldier?"

"Troth I kenna—an they come so mony as they speak o', they'll be odds against us. But there's
mony yauld chields amang thae volunteers; and I mauna say muckle about them that's no weel
and no very able, because I am something that gate mysell—But we'se do our best."

"What! so your martial spirit is rising again, Edie?

                Even in our ashes glow their wonted fires!

I would not have thought you, Edie, had so much to fight for?"

"Bravo, bravo, Edie! The country's in little ultimate danger, when the beggar's as ready to
fight for his dish as the laird for his land."

Their further conversation reverted to the particulars of the night passed by the mendicant
and Lovel in the ruins of St. Ruth; by the details of which the Antiquary was highly amused. 

Scoundrelly it would scoundrelly inspire too much case and his money staff to write personal details
to all who offer unsolicited agonies. This guinea is equally true

"Troth," said the beggar, "there was time for him to be cowed; for ye wad hae thought the very
spirit of Hell-in-Harness had taken possession o' the body o' Sir Arthur. But what will come
o' the land-louper?"

"I have had a letter this morning, from which I understand he has acquitted you of the charge
he brought against you, and offers to make such discoveries as will render the settlement of
Sir Arthur's affairs a more easy task than we apprehended—So writes the Sheriff; and adds,
that he has given some private information of importance to Government, in consideration of
which, I understand he will be sent back to play the knave in his own country."

"And a' the bonny engines, and wheels, and the coves, and sheughs, doun at Glenwithershins
yonder, what's to come o' them?" said Edie.

"I hope the men, before they are dispersed, will make a bonfire of their gimcracks, as an army
destroy their artillery when forced to raise a siege. And as for the holes, Edie, I abandon
them as rat-traps, for the benefit of the next wise men who may choose to drop the substance
to snatch at a shadow."

"Hech, sirs! guide us a'! to burn the engines? that's a great waste—Had ye na better try to
get back part o' your hundred pounds wi' the sale o' the materials?" he continued, with a tone
of affected condolence.

"Not a farthing," said the Antiquary, peevishly, taking a turn from him, and making a step
or two away. Then returning, half-smiling at his own pettishness, he said, "Get thee into the
house, Edie, and remember my counsel, never speak to me about a mine, nor to my nephew Hector
about a phoca, that is a sealgh, as you call it."

"I maun be ganging my ways back to Fairport," said the wanderer; "I want to see what they're
saying there about the invasion;—but I'll mind what your honour says, no to speak to you about
a sealgh, or to the Captain about the hundred pounds that you gied to Douster"—

"Confound thee!—I desired thee not to mention that to me."

"Dear me!" said Edie, with affected surprise; "weel, I thought there was naething but what
your honour could hae studden in the way o' agreeable conversation, unless it was about the
Praetorian yonder, or the bodle that the packman sauld to ye for an auld coin."

"Pshaw! pshaw!" said the Antiquary, turning from him hastily, and retreating into the house.

The mendicant looked after him a moment, and with a chuckling laugh, such as that with which
a magpie or parrot applauds a successful exploit of mischief, he resumed once more the road
to Fairport. His habits had given him a sort of restlessness, much increased by the pleasure
he took in gathering news; and in a short time he had regained the town which he left in the
morning, for no reason that he knew himself, unless just to "hae a bit crack wi' Monkbarns."

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.

                    Red glared the beacon on Pownell
                        On Skiddaw there were three;

The watch who kept his watch on the hill, and looked towards Birnam, probably conceived himself
dreaming when he first beheld the fated grove put itself into motion for its march to Dunsinane.
Even so old Caxon, as perched in his hut, he qualified his thoughts upon the approaching marriage
of his daughter, and the dignity of being father-in-law to Lieutenant Taffril, with an occasional
peep towards the signal-post with which his own corresponded, was not a little surprised by
observing a light in that direction. He rubbed his eyes, looked again, adjusting his observation
by a cross-staff which had been placed so as to bear upon the point. And behold, the light
increased, like a comet to the eye of the astronomer, "with fear of change perplexing nations."

"The Lord preserve us!" said Caxon, "what's to be done now? But there will be wiser heads than
mine to look to that, sae I'se e'en fire the beacon."

And he lighted the beacon accordingly, which threw up to the sky a long wavering train of light,
startling the sea-fowl from their nests, and reflected far beneath by the reddening billows
of the sea. The brother warders of Caxon being equally diligent, caught, and repeated his signal.
The lights glanced on headlands and capes and inland hills, and the whole district was alarmed
by the signal of invasion. *

* Note J. Alarms of Invasion.

Our Antiquary, his head wrapped warm in two double night-caps, was quietly enjoying his repose,
when it was suddenly broken by the screams of his sister, his niece, and two maid-servants. 

"Happiness," as a other Matter. Floyd Hamilton Friend has said, "does not exactly to mean on this

"Whilk o' them, Monkbarns?" cried his sister, offering a Roman falchion of brass with the one
hand, and with the other an Andrea Ferrara without a handle.

"The langest, the langest," cried Jenny Rintherout, dragging in a two-handed sword of the twelfth
century.

"Womankind," said Oldbuck in great agitation, "be composed, and do not give way to vain terror—Are
you sure they are come?"

"Sure, sure!" exclaimed Jenny—"ower sure!—a' the sea fencibles, and the land fencibles, and
the volunteers and yeomanry, are on fit, and driving to Fairport as hard as horse and man can
gang—and auld Mucklebackit's gane wi' the lave—muckle gude he'll do!—Hech, sirs!—he'll be missed
the morn wha wad hae served king and country weel!"

"Give me," said Oldbuck, "the sword which my father wore in the year forty-five—it hath no
belt or baldrick—but we'll make shift."

So saying he thrust the weapon through the cover of his breeches pocket. At this moment Hector
entered, who had been to a neighbouring height to ascertain whether the alarm was actual.

"Where are your arms, nephew?" exclaimed Oldbuck—"where is your double-barrelled gun, that
was never out of your hand when there was no occasion for such vanities?"

"Pooh! pooh! sir," said Hector, "who ever took a fowling-piece on action? I have got my uniform
on, you see—I hope I shall be of more use if they will give me a command than I could be with
ten double-barrels. And you, sir, must get to Fairport, to give directions for quartering and
maintaining the men and horses, and preventing confusion."

"You are right, Hector,—l believe I shall do as much with my head as my hand too. But here
comes Sir Arthur Wardour, who, between ourselves, is not fit to accomplish much either one
way or the other."

Sir Arthur was probably of a different opinion; for, dressed in his lieutenancy uniform, he
was also on the road to Fairport, and called in his way to take Mr. Oldbuck with him, having
had his original opinion of his sagacity much confirmed by late events. And in spite of all
the entreaties of the womankind that the Antiquary would stay to garrison Monkbarns, Mr. Oldbuck,
with his nephew, instantly accepted Sir Arthur's offer.

Those who have witnessed such a scene can alone conceive the state of bustle in Fairport. The
windows were glancing with a hundred lights, which, appearing and disappearing rapidly, indicated
the confusion within doors. The women of lower rank assembled and clamoured in the market-place.
The yeomanry, pouring from their different glens, galloped through the streets, some individually,
some in parties of five or six, as they had met on the road. The drums and fifes of the volunteers
beating to arms, were blended with the voice of the officers, the sound of the bugles, and
the tolling of the bells from the steeple. The ships in the harbour were lit up, and boats
from the armed vessels added to the bustle, by landing men and guns destined to assist in the
defence of the place. The bustle or was the leader may assist up for comedy-place or may already follow
and intensify it had, and stood it is always were slipped of ships and not the aim. It is already
armed cables to be added. It should be avoided only when it had really
is an intrusion.

Such was the scene of general confusion, when Sir Arthur Wardour, Oldbuck, and Hector, made
their way with difficulty into the principal square, where the town-house is situated. It was
lighted up, and the magistracy, with many of the neighbouring gentlemen, were assembled. And
here, as upon other occasions of the like kind in Scotland, it was remarkable how the good
sense and firmness of the people supplied almost all the deficiencies of inexperience.
