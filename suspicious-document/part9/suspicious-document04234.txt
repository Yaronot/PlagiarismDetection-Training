CHAPTER X.

Within a few minutes after Hermas had flung himself out of window into the roadway, Phoebicius
walked into his sleeping-room.  Sirona had had time to throw herself on to her couch; she was
terribly frightened, and had turned her face to the wall.  Did he actually know that some one
had been with her?  And who could have betrayed her, and have called him home?  Or could he
have come home by accident sooner than usual?

It was dark in the room, and he could not see her face, and yet she kept her eyes shut as if
asleep, for every fraction of a minute in which she could still escape seeing him in his fury
seemed a reprieve; and yet her heart beat so violently that it seemed to her that he must hear
it, when he approached the bed with a soft step that was peculiar to him.  She heard him walk
up and down, and at last go into the kitchen that adjoined the sleeping-room.  In a few moments
she perceived through her half- closed eyes, that he, had brought in a light; he had lighted
a lamp at the hearth, and now searched both the rooms.

As yet he had not spoken to her, nor opened his lips to utter a word.

Now he was in the sitting-room, and now--involuntarily she drew herself into a heap, and pulled
the coverlet over her head--now he laughed aloud, so loud and scornfully, that she felt her
hands and feet turn cold, and a rushing crimson mist floated before her eyes.  Then the light
came back into the bed-room, and came nearer and nearer.  She felt her head pushed by his hard
hand, and with a feeble scream she flung off the coverlet and sat up.

Still he did not speak a word, but what she saw was quite enough to smother the last spark
of her courage and hope, for her husband's eyes showed only the whites, his sallow features
were ashy-pale, and on his brow the branded mark of Mithras stood out more clearly than ever.
In his right hand he held the lamp, in his left Hermas' sheepskin.

As his haggard eye met hers he held the anchorite's matted garment so close to her face, that
it touched her.  Then he threw it violently on the floor, and asked in a low, husky voice,
"What is that?"

She was silent.  He went up to the little table near her bed; on it stood her night-draught
in a pretty colored glass, that Polykarp had brought her from Alexandria as a token, and with
the back of his hand he swept it from the table, so that it fell on the dais, and flew with
a crash into a thousand fragments.  She screamed, the greyhound sprang up and barked at the
Gaul.  He seized the little beast's collar, and flung it so violently across the room, that
it uttered a pitiful cry of pain.  The dog had belonged to Sirona since she was quite a girl,
it had come with her to Rome, and from thence to the oasis; it clung to her with affection,
and she to it, for Iambe liked no one to caress and stroke her so much as her mistress.  She
was so much alone, and the greyhound was always with her, and not only entertained her by such
tricks as any other dog might have learned, but was to her a beloved, dumb, but by no means
deaf, companion from her early home, who would prick its ears when she spoke the name of her
dear little sisters in distant Arelas, from whom she had not heard for years; or it would look
sadly in her face, and kiss her white hands, when longing forced tears into her eyes.

In her solitary, idle, childless existence Iambe was much, very much, to her, and now as she
saw her faithful companion and friend creep ill- treated and whining up to her bed--as the
supple animal tried in vain to spring up and take refuge in her lap, and held out to his mistress
his trembling, perhaps broken, little paw, fear vanished from the miserable young woman's heart--she
sprang from her couch, took the little dog in her arms, and exclaimed with a glance, which
flashed with anything rather than fear or repentance: "You do not touch the poor little beast
again, if you take my advice."

"I will drown it to-morrow morning," replied Phoebicius with perfect indifference, but with
an evil smile on his flaccid lips.  "So many two- legged lovers make themselves free to my
house, that I do not see why I should share your affections with a quadruped into the bargain.
How came this sheepskin here?"  Sirona vouchsafed no answer to this last question, but she
exclaimed in great excitement, "By God--by your God--by the mighty Rock, and by all the gods!
if you do the little beast a harm, it will be the last day I stop in your house."

"Hear her!"  said the centurion, "and where do you propose to travel to? The desert is wide
and there is room and to spare to starve in it, and for your bones to bleach there.  How grieved
your lovers would be--for their sakes I will take care before drowning the dog to lock in its
mistress."

"Only try to touch me," screamed Sirona beside herself, and springing to the window.  "If you
lay a finger on me, I will call for help, and Dorothea and her husband will protect me against
you."

"Hardly," answered Phoebicius drily.  "It would suit you no doubt to find yourself under the
same roof as that great boy who brings you colored glass, and throws roses into your window,
and perhaps has strewed the road with them by which he found his way to you to-day.  But there
are nevertheless laws which protect the Roman citizen from criminals and impudent seducers.
You were always a great deal too much in the house over there, and you have exchanged your
games with the little screaming beggars for one with the grownup child, the rose-thrower-the
fop, who, for your sake, and not to be recognized, covers up his purple coat with a sheepskin!
Do you think, you can teach me anything about lovesick night- wanderers and women?

"I see through it all!  Not one step do you set henceforth across Petrus' threshold.  There
is the open window--scream--scream as loud as you will, and let all the people know of your
disgrace.  I have the greatest mind to carry this sheepskin to the judge, the first thing in
the morning.  I shall go now, and set the room behind the kitchen in order for you; there is
no window there through which men in sheepskin can get in to my house. You shall live there
till you are tamed, and kiss my feet, and confess what has been going on here to-night.  I
shall learn nothing from the senator's slaves, that I very well know; for you have turned all
their heads too--they grin with delight when they see you.  All friends are made welcome by
you, even when they wear nothing but sheepskin.  But they may do what they please--I have the
right keeper for you in my own hand. I am going at once--you may scream if you like, but I
should myself prefer that you should keep quiet.  As to the dog, we have not yet heard the
last of the matter; for the present I will keep him here.  If you are quiet and come to your
senses, he may live for aught I care; but if you are refractory, a rope and a stone can soon
be found, and the stream runs close below.  You know I never jest--least of all just now."

Sirona's whole frame was in the most violent agitation.  Her breath came quickly, her limbs
trembled, but she could not find words to answer him.

Phoebicius saw what was passing in her mind, and he went on, "You may snort proudly now; but
an hour will come when you will crawl up to me like your lame dog, and pray for mercy.  I have
another idea--you will want a couch in the dark room, and it must be soft, or I shall be blamed;
I will spread out the sheepskin for you.  You see I know how to value your adorer's offerings."

The Gaul laughed loud, seized the hermit's garment, and went with the lamp into the dark room
behind the kitchen, in which vessels and utensils of various sorts were kept.  These he set
on one side to turn it into a sleeping-room for his wife, of whose guilt he was fully convinced.

Who the man was for whose sake she had dishonored him, he knew not, for Miriam had said nothing
more than, "Go home, your wife is laughing with her lover."

While her husband was still threatening and storming, Sirona had said to herself, that she
would rather die than live any longer with this man. That she herself was not free from fault
never occurred to her mind.  He who is punished more severely than he deserves, easily overlooks
his own fault in his feeling of the judge's injustice.

Phoebicius was right; neither Petrus nor Dorothea had it in their power to protect her against
him, a Roman citizen.  If she could not contrive to help her self she was a prisoner, and without
air, light, and freedom she could not live.  During his last speech her resolution had been
quickly matured, and hardly had he turned his back and crossed the threshold, than she hurried
up to her bed, wrapped the trembling greyhound in the coverlet, took it in her arms like a
child, and ran into the sitting-room with her light burden; the shutters were still open of
the window through which Hermas had fled into the open.  With the help of a stool she took
the same way, let herself slip down from the sill into the street, and hastened on without
aim or goal--inspired only by the wish to escape durance in the dark room, and to burst every
bond that tied her to her hated mate--up the church-hill and along the road which lead over
the mountain to the sea.

Phoebicius gave her a long start, for after having arranged her prison he remained some time
in the little room behind the kitchen, not in order to give her time, collect his thoughts
or to reflect on his future action, but simply because he felt utterly exhausted.

The centurion was nearly sixty years of age, and his frame, originally a powerful one, was
now broken by every sort of dissipation, and could no longer resist the effects of the strain
and excitement of this night.

The lean, wiry, and very active man did not usually fall into these fits of total enervation
excepting in the daytime, for after sundown a wonderful change would come over the gray-headed
veteran, who nevertheless still displayed much youthful energy in the exercise of his official
duties.  At night his drooping eyelids, that almost veiled his eyes, opened more wildly, his
flaccid hanging under-lip closed firmly, his long neck and narrow elongated head were held
erect, and when, at a later hour, he went out to drinking-bouts or to the service in honor
of Mithras, he might often still be taken for a fine, indomitable young man.

But when he was drunk he was no longer gay, but wild, braggart, and noisy.  It frequently happened
that before he left the carouse, while he was still in the midst of his boon-companions, the
syncope would come upon him which had so often alarmed Sirona, and from which he could never
feel perfectly safe even when he was on duty at the head of his soldiers.

 Petrus had heard nothing but good of Paulus, and yet he measured
him now with no friendly eye, for all that wore the aspect of extravagance repelled his temperate
and methodical nature.  Paulus was made conscious of what was passing in the senator's mind
when, without vouchsafing a single word, he took the key from his hand.  It was not a matter
of indifference to him, that this man should think ill of him, and he said, with some embarrassment:

"We do not usually go among people without a sheepskin, but I have lost mine."

Hardly had he uttered the words, when Phoebicius came back with Hermas' sheepskin in his hand,
and cried out to Petrus:

"This I found on my return home, in our sleeping-room."

"And when have you ever seen Polykarp in such a mantle?"  asked Dorothea.

"When the gods visit the daughters of men," replied the centurion, "they have always made choice
of strange disguises.  Why should not a perfumed Alexandrian gentleman transform himself for
once into one of those rough fools on the mountain?  However, even old Homer sometimes nodded--and
I confess that I was in error with regard to your son.  I meant no offence, senator!  You have
lived here longer than I; who can have made me a present of this skin, which still seems to
be pretty new--horns and all."

Petrus examined and felt the skin, "This is an anchorite's garment," he said; "the penitents
on the mountain are all accustomed to wear such."

"It is one of those rascals then that has found his way into my house!" exclaimed the centurion.
"I bear Caesar's commission, and I am to exterminate ill vagabonds that trouble the dwellers
in the oasis, or travellers in the desert.  Thus run the orders which I brought with me from
Rome.  I will drive the low fellows together like deer for hunting, for they are all rogues
and villains, and I shall know how to torture them until I find the right one."

"The emperor will ill-requite you for that," replied Petrus.  "They are pious Christians, and
you know that Constantine himself--"

"Constantine!"  exclaimed the centurion scornfully.  "Perhaps he will let himself be baptized,
for water can hurt no one, and he cannot, like the great Diocletian, exterminate the masses
who run after the crucified miracle-monger, without depopulating the country.  Look at these
coins; here is the image of Caesar, and what is this on the other side?  Is this your Nazarene,
or is it the old god, the immortal and invincible sun? And is that man one of your creed, who
in Constantinople adores Tyche and the Dioscuri Castor and Pollux?  The water he is baptized
with to-day he will wipe away to-morrow, and the old gods will be his defenders, if in more
peaceful times he maintains them against your superstitions."

"But it will be a good while till then," said Perrus coolly.  "For the present, at least, Constantine
is the protector of the Christians.  I advise you to put your affair into the hands of Bishop
Agapitus."

"That he may serve me up a dish of your doctrine, which is bad even for women," said the centurion
laughing; "and that I may kiss my enemies' feet?  They are a vile rabble up there, I repeat
it, and they shall be treated as such till I have found my man.  I shall begin the hunt this
very day."

"And this very day you may end it, for the sheepskin is mine."

It was Paulus who spoke these words in a loud and decided tone; all eyes were at once turned
on him and on the centurion.

Petrus and the slaves had frequently seen the anchorite, but never without a sheepskin similar
to that which Phoebicius held in his hand. The anchorite's self-accusation must have appeared
incredible, and indeed scarcely possible, to all who knew Paulus and Sirona; and nevertheless
no one, not even the senator, doubted it for an instant.  Dame Dorothea only shook her head
incredulously, and though she could find no explanation for the occurrence, she still could
not but say to herself, that this man did not look like a lover, and that Sirona would hardly
have forgotten her duty for his sake.  She could not indeed bring herself to believe in Sirona's
guilt at all, for she was heartily well disposed towards her; besides--though it, no doubt,
was not right--her motherly vanity inclined her to believe that if the handsome young woman
had indeed sinned, she would have preferred her fine tall Polykarp--whose roses and flaming
glances she blamed in all sincerity--to this shaggy, wild-looking graybeard.

Quite otherwise thought the centurion.  He was quite ready to believe in the anchorite's confession,
for the more unworthy the man for whom Sirona had broken faith, the greater seemed her guilt,
and the more unpardonable her levity; and to his man's vanity it seemed to him easier--particularly
in the presence of such witnesses as Petrus and Dorothea--to bear the fact that his wife should
have sought variety and pleasure at any cost, even at that of devoting herself to a ragged
beggar, than that she should have given her affections to a younger, handsomer, and worthier
man than himself.  He had sinned much against her, but all that lay like feathers on his side
of the scales, while that which she had done weighed down hers like a load of lead.  He began
to feel like a man who, in wading through a bog, has gained firm ground with one foot, and
all these feelings gave him energy to walk up to the anchorite with a self-control, of which
he was not generally master, excepting when on duty at the head of his soldiers.

He approached the Alexandrian with an assumption of dignity and a demeanor which testified
to his formerly having taken part in the representations of tragedies in the theatres of great
cities.  Paulus, on his part, did not retreat by a single step, but looked at him with a smile
that alarmed Petrus and the rest of the bystanders.  The law put the anchorite absolutely into
the power of the outraged husband, but Phoebicius did not seem disposed to avail himself of
his rights, and nothing but contempt and loathing were perceptible in his tone, as he said:

"A man who takes hold of a mangy dog in order to punish him, only dirties his hand.  The woman
who betrayed me for your sake, and you--you dirty beggar--are worthy of each other.  I could
crush you like a fly that can be destroyed by a blow of my hand if I chose, but my sword is
Caesar's, and shall never be soiled by such foul blood as yours; however, the beast shall not
have cast off his skin for nothing, it is thick, and so you have only spared me the trouble
of tearing it off you before giving you your due.  You shall find no lack of blows.  Confess
where your sweetheart has fled to and they shall be few, but if you are slow to answer they
will be many.  Lend me that thing there, fellow!"

With these words he took a whip of hippopotamus hide out of a camel- driver's band, went close
up to the Alexandrian, and asked: "Where is Sirona?"

"Nay, you may beat me," said Paulus.  "However hard your whip may fall on me, it cannot be
heavy enough for my sins; but as to where your wife is hiding, that I really cannot tell you--not
even if you were to tear my limbs with pincers instead of stroking me with that wretched thing."

There was something so genuinely honest in Paulus' voice and tone, that the centurion was inclined
to believe him; but it was not his way to let a threatened punishment fail of execution, and
this strange beggar should learn by experience that when his hand intended to hit hard, it
was far from "stroking."  And Paulus did experience it, without uttering a cry, and without
stirring from the spot where he stood.

When at last Phoebicius dropped his weary arm and breathlessly repeated his question, the ill-used
man replied, "I told you before I do not know, and therefore I cannot reveal it."

Up to this moment Petrus, though he had felt strongly impelled to rush to the rescue of his
severely handled fellow-believer, had nevertheless allowed the injured husband to have his
way, for he seemed disposed to act with unusual mildness, and the Alexandrian to be worthy
of all punishment; but at this point Dorothea's request would not have been needed to prompt
him to interfere.

He went up to the centurion, and said to him in an undertone, "You have given the evil-doer
his due, and if you desire that he should undergo a severer punishment than you can inflict,
carry the matter--I say once more--before the bishop.  You will gain nothing more here.  Take
my word for it, I know the man and his fellow-men; he actually knows nothing of where your
wife is hiding, and you are only wasting the time and strength which you would do better to
save, in order to search for Sirona. I fancy she will have tried to reach the sea, and to get
to Egypt or possibly to Alexandria; and there--you know what the Greek city is--she will fall
into utter ruin."

"And so," laughed the Gaul, "find what she seeks--variety, and every kind of pleasure.  For
a young thing like that, who loves amusement, there is no pleasant occupation but vice.  But
I will spoil her game; you are right, it is not well to give her too long a start.  If she
has found the road to the sea, she may already--Hey, here Talib!"  He beckoned to Polykarp's
Amalekite messenger.  "You have just come from Raithu; did you meet a flying woman on the way,
with yellow hair and a white face?"

The Amalekite, a free man with sharp eyes, who was highly esteemed in the senator's house,
and even by Phoebicius himself, as a trustworthy and steady man, had expected this question,
and eagerly replied:

"At two stadia beyond el Heswe I met a large caravan from Petra, which rested yesterday in
the oasis here; a woman, such as you describe, was running with it.  When I heard what had
happened here I wanted to speak, but who listens to a cricket while it thunders?"

"Had she a lame greyhound with her?"  asked Phoebicius, full of expectation.

"She carried something in her arms," answered the Amalekite.  "In the moonlight I took it for
a baby.  My brother, who was escorting the caravan, told me the lady was no doubt running away,
for she had paid the charge for the escort not in ready money, but with a gold signet-ring."

The Gaul remembered a certain gold ring with a finely carved onyx, which long years ago he
had taken from Glycera's finger, for she had another one like it, and which he had given to
Sirona on the day of their marriage.

"It is strange!"  thought he,  "what we give to women to bind them to us they use as weapons
to turn against us, be it to please some other man, or to smooth the path by which they escape
from us.  It was with a bracelet of Glycera's that I paid the captain of the ship that brought
us to Alexandria; but the soft-hearted fool, whose dove flew after me, and I are men of a different
stamp; I will follow my flown bird, and catch it again."  He spoke the last words aloud, and
then desired one of the senator's slaves to give his mule a good feed and drink, for his own
groom, and the superior decurion who during his absence must take his place, were also worshippers
of Mithras, and had not yet returned from the mountain.

Phoebicius did not doubt that the woman who had joined the caravan--which he himself had seen
yesterday--was his fugitive wife, and he knew that his delay might have reduced his earnest
wish to overtake her and punish her to the remotest probability; but he was a Roman soldier,
and would rather have laid violent hands on himself than have left his post without a deputy.
When at last his fellow-worshippers came from their sacrifice and worship of the rising sun,
his preparations for his long journey were completed.

Phoebicius carefully impressed on the decurion all he had to do during his absence, and how
he was to conduct himself; then he delivered the key of his house into Petrus' keeping as well
as the black slave-woman, who wept loudly and passionately over the flight of her mistress;
he requested the senator to bring the anchorite's misdeed to the knowledge of the bishop, and
then, guided by the Amalekite Talib, who rode before him on his dromedary, he trotted hastily
away in pursuit of the caravan, so as to reach the sea, if possible, before its embarkation.

As the hoofs of the mule sounded fainter and fainter in the distance, Paulus also quitted the
senator's courtyard; Dorothea pointed after him as he walked towards the mountain.  "In truth,
husband," said she, "this has been a strange morning; everything that has occurred looks as
clear as day, and yet I cannot understand it all.  My heart aches when I think what may happen
to the wretched Sirona if her enraged husband overtakes her.  It seems to me that there are
two sorts of marriage; one was instituted by the most loving of the angels, nay, by the All-merciful
Himself, but the other it is not to be thought of!  How can those two live together for the
future?  And that under our roof!  Their closed house looks to me as though ruined and burnt-out,
and we have already seen the nettles spring up which grow everywhere among the ruins of human
dwellings."

CHAPTER XII.

The path of every star is fixed and limited, every plant bears flowers and fruit which in form
and color exactly resemble their kind, and in all the fundamental characteristics of their
qualities and dispositions, of their instinctive bent and external impulse, all animals of
the same species resemble each other; thus, the hunter who knows the red-deer in his father's
forest, may know in every forest on earth how the stag will behave in any given case.  The
better a genus is fitted for variability in the conformation of its individuals, the higher
is the rank it is entitled to hold in the graduated series of creatures capable of development;
and it is precisely that wonderful many-sidedness of his inner life, and of its outward manifestation,
which assigns to man his superiority over all other animated beings.

Some few of our qualities and activities can be fitly symbolized in allegorical fashion by
animals; thus, courage finds an emblem in the lion, gentleness in the dove, but the perfect
human form has satisfied a thousand generations, and will satisfy a thousand more, when we
desire to reduce the divinity to a sensible image, for, in truth, our heart is as surely capable
of comprehending "God in us,"--that is in our feelings-- as our intellect is capable of comprehending
His outward manifestation in the universe.

Every characteristic of every finite being is to be found again in man, and no characteristic
that we can attribute to the Most High is foreign to our own soul, which, in like manner, is
infinite and immeasurable, for it can extend its investigating feelers to the very utmost boundary
of space and time.  Hence, the roads which are open to the soul, are numberless as those of
the divinity.  Often they seem strange, but the initiated very well know that these roads are
in accordance to fixed laws, and that even the most exceptional emotions of the soul may be
traced back to causes which were capable of giving rise to them and to no others.

Blows hurt, disgrace is a burden, and unjust punishment embitters the heart, but Paulus' soul
had sought and found a way to which these simple propositions did not apply.

He had been ill-used and contemned, and, though perfectly innocent, ere he left the oasis he
was condemned to the severest penance.  As soon as the bishop had heard from Petrus of all
that had happened in his house, he had sent for Paulus, and as he could answer nothing to the
accusation, he had expelled him from his flock--to which the anchorites belonged-- forbidden
him to visit the church on week-days, and declared that this his sentence should be publicly
proclaimed before the assembled congregation of the believers.

And how did this affect Paulus as he climbed the mountain, lonely and proscribed?

A fisherman from the little seaport of Pharan, who met him half-way and exchanged a greeting
with him, thought to himself as he looked after him, "The great graybeard looks as happy as
if he had found a treasure."  Then he walked on into the valley with his scaly wares, reminded,
as he went, of his son's expression of face when his wife bore him his first little one.

Near the watch-tower at the edge of the defile, a party of anchorites were piling some stones
together.  They had already heard of the bishop's sentence on Paulus, the sinner, and they
gave him no greeting.  He observed it and was silent, but when they could no longer see him
he laughed to himself and muttered, while he rubbed a weal that the centurion's whip had left
upon his back, "If they think that a Gaul's cudgel has a pleasant flavor they are mistaken,
however I would not exchange it for a skin of Anthyllan wine; and if they could only know that
at least one of the stripes which torments me is due to each one of themselves, they would
be surprised!  But away with pride!  How they spat on Thee, Jesus my Lord, and who am I, and
how mildly have they dealt with me, when I for once have taken on my back another's stripes.
Not a drop of blood was drawn!  I wish the old man had hit harder!"

He walked cheerfully forward, and his mind recurred to the centurion's speech that he could
if he list, "tread him down like a worm," and he laughed again softly, for he was quite aware
that he was ten times as strong as Phoebicius, and formerly he had overthrown the braggart
Arkesilaos of Kyrene and his cousin, the tall Xenophanes, both at once in the sand of the Palaestra.
Then he thought of Hermas, of his sweet dead mother, and of his father, and--which was the
most comforting thought of all--of how he had spared the old man this bitter sorrow.

On his path there grew a little plant with a reddish blossom.  In years he had never looked
at a flower or, at any rate, had never wished to possess one; to-day he stooped down over the
blossom that graced the rock, meaning to pluck it.  But he did not carry out his intention,
for before he had laid his hand upon it, he reflected:

"To whom could I offer it?  And perhaps the flowers themselves rejoice in the light, and in
the silent life that is in their roots.  How tightly it clings to the rock.  Farther away from
the road flowers of even greater beauty blow, seen by no mortal eye; they deck themselves in
beauty for no one but for their Creator, and because they rejoice in themselves.  I too will
withdraw from the highways of mankind; let them accuse me!  So long as I live at peace with
myself and my God I ask nothing of any one.  He that abases himself--aye, he that abases himself!--My
hour too shall come, and above and beyond this life I shall see them all once more; Petrus
and Dorothea, Agapitus and the brethren who now refuse to receive me, and then, when my Saviour
himself beckons me to Him, they will see me as I am, and hasten to me and greet me with double
kindness."

He looked up, proud and rejoicing as he thought thus, and painted to himself the joys of Paradise,
to which this day he had earned an assured claim.  He never took longer and swifter steps than
when his mind was occupied with such meditations, and when he reached Stephanus' cave he thought
the way from the oasis to the heights had been shorter than usual.

He found the sick man in great anxiety, for he had waited until now for his son in vain, and
feared that Hermas had met with some accident--or had abandoned him, and fled out into the
world.  Paulus soothed him with gentle words, and told him of the errand on which he had sent
the lad to the farther coast of the sea.

We are never better disposed to be satisfied with even bad news than when we have expected
it to be much worse; so Stephanus listened to his friend's explanation quite calmly, and with
signs of approval.  He could no longer conceal from himself that Hermas was not ripe for the
life of an anchorite, and since he had learned that his unhappy wife--whom he had so long given
up for lost--had died a Christian, he found that he could reconcile his thoughts to relinquishing
the boy to the world.  He had devoted himself and his son to a life of penance, hoping and
striving that so Glycera's soul might be snatched from damnation, and now he knew that she
herself had earned her title to Heaven.

"When will he come home again?"  he asked Paulus.

"In five or six days," was the answer.  "Ali, the fisherman--out of whose foot I took a thorn
some time since--informed me secretly, as I was going to church yesterday, that the Blemmyes
are gathering behind the sulphur- mountains; when they have withdrawn, it will be high time
to send Hermas to Alexandria.  My brother is still alive, and for my sake he will receive him
as a blood-relation, for he too has been baptized."

"He may attend the school of catechumens in the metropolis, and if he-- if he--"

"That we shall see," interrupted Paulus.  "For the present it comes to this, we must let him
go from hence, and leave him to seek out his own way.  You fancy that there may be in heaven
a place of glory for such as have never been overcome, and you would fain have seen Hermas
among them. It reminds me of the physician of Corinth, who boasted that he was cleverer than
any of his colleagues, for that not one of his patients had ever died.  And the man was right,
for neither man nor beast had ever trusted to his healing arts.  Let Hermas try his young strength,
and even if he be no priest, but a valiant warrior like his forefathers, even so he may honestly
serve God.  But it will be a long time before all this comes to pass.  So long as he is away
I will attend on you--you still have some water in your jar?"

"It has twice been filled for me," said the old man.  "The brown shepherdess, who so often
waters her goats at our spring, came to me the first thing in the morning and again about two
hours ago; she asked after Hermas, and then offered of her own accord to fetch water for me
so long as he was away.  She is as timid as a bird, and flew off as soon as she had set down
the jug."

"She belongs to Petrus and cannot leave her goats for long," said Paulus. "Now I will go and
find you some herbs for a relish; there will be no more wine in the first place.  Look me in
the face--for how great a sinner now do you take me?  Think the very worst of me, and yet perhaps
you will hear worse said of me.  But here come two men.  Stay! one is Hilarion, one of the
bishop's acolytes, and the other is Pachomius the Memphite, who lately came to the mountain.
They are coming up here, and the Egyptian is carrying a small jar.  I would it might hold some
more wine to keep up your strength."

The two friends had not long to remain in ignorance of their visitor's purpose.  So soon as
they reached Stephanus' cave, both turned their backs on Paulus with conspicuously marked intention;
nay the acolyte signed his brow with the cross, as if he thought it necessary to protect himself
against evil influences.

The Alexandrian understood; he drew back and was silent, while Hilarion explained to the sick
man that Paulus was guilty of grave sins, and that, until he had done full penance, he must
remain excluded as a rotten sheep from the bishop's flock, as well as interdicted from waiting
on a pious Christian.

"We know from Petrus," the speaker went on, "that your son, father, has been sent across the
sea, and as you still need waiting on, Agapitus sends you by me his blessing and this strengthening
wine; this youth too will stay by you, and provide you with all necessaries until Hermas comes
home."

With these words he gave the wine-jar to the old man, who looked in astonishment from him to
Paulus, who felt indeed cut to the heart when the bishop's messenger turned to him for an instant,
and with the cry, "Get thee out from among us!" disappeared.  How many kindly ties, how many
services willingly rendered and affectionately accepted were swept away by these words--but
Paulus obeyed at once.  He went up to his sick friend, their eyes met and each could see that
the eyes of the other were dimmed with tears.

"Paulus!" cried the old man, stretching out both his hands to his departing friend, whom he
felt he could forgive whatever his guilt; but the Alexandrian did not take them, but turned
away, and, without looking back, hastily went up the mountain to a pathless spot, and then
on towards the valley--onwards and still onwards, till he was brought to a pause by the steep
declivity of the hollow way which led southwards from the mountains into the oasis.

The sun stood high and it was burning hot.  Streaming with sweat and panting for breath he
leaned against the glowing porphyry wall behind him, hid his face in his hands and strove to
collect himself, to think, to pray--for a long time in vain; for instead of joy in the suffering
which he had taken upon himself, the grief of isolation weighed upon his heart, and the lamentable
cry of the old man had left a warning echo in his soul, and roused doubts of the righteousness
of a deed, by which even the best and purest had been deceived, and led into injustice towards
him.  His heart was breaking with anguish and grief, but when at last he returned to the consciousness
of his sufferings physical and mental, he began to recover his courage, and even smiled as
he murmured to himself:

"It is well, it is well--the more I suffer the more surely shall I find grace.  And besides,
if the old man had seen Hermas go through what I have experienced it would undoubtedly have
killed him.  Certainly I wish it could have been done without--without--aye, it is even so--without
deceit; even when I was a heathen I was truthful and held a lie, whether in myself or in another,
in as deep horror as father Abraham held murder, and yet when the Lord required him, he led
his son Isaac to the slaughter.  And Moses when he beat the overseer--and Elias, and Deborah,
and Judith.  I have taken upon myself no less than they, but my lie will surely be forgiven
me, if it is not reckoned against them that they shed blood."

These and such reflections restored Paulus to equanimity and to satisfaction with his conduct,
and he began to consider, whether he should return to his old cave and the neighborhood of
Stephanus, or seek for a new abode.  He decided on the latter course; but first he must find
fresh water and some sort of nourishment; for his mouth and tongue were quite parched.

Lower down in the valley sprang a brooklet of which he knew, and hard by it grew various herbs
and roots, with which he had often allayed his hunger.  He followed the declivity to its base,
then turning to the left, he crossed a small table land, which was easily accessible from the
gorge, but which on the side of the oasis formed a perpendicular cliff many fathoms deep. 
Between it and the main mass of the mountain rose numerous single peaks, like a camp of granite
tents, or a wildly tossing sea suddenly turned to stone; behind these blocks ran the streamlet,
which he found after a short search.

Perfectly refreshed, and with renewed resolve to bear the worst with patience, he returned
to the plateau, and from the edge of the precipice he gazed down into the desert gorge that
stretched away far below his feet, and in whose deepest and remotest hollow the palmgroves
and tamarisk-thickets of the oasis showed as a sharply defined mass of green, like a luxuriant
wreath flung upon a bier.  The whitewashed roofs of the little town of Pharan shone brightly
among the branches and clumps of verdure, and above them all rose the new church, which he
was now forbidden to enter.  For a moment the thought was keenly painful that he was excluded
from the devotions of the community, from the Lord's supper and from congregational prayer,
but then he asked, was not every block of stone on the mountain an altar--was not the blue
sky above a thousand times wider, and more splendid than the mightiest dome raised by the hand
of man, not even excepting the vaulted roof of the Serapeum at Alexandria, and he remembered
the "Amen" of the stones, that had rung out after the preaching of the blind man.  By this
time he had quite recovered himself, and he went towards the cliff in order to find a cavern
that he knew of, and that was empty--for its gray-headed inhabitant had died some weeks since.
"Verily," thought he, "it seems to me that I am by no means weighed down by the burden of my
disgrace, but, on the contrary, lifted up.  Here at least I need not cast down my eyes, for
I am alone with my God, and in his presence I feel I need not be ashamed."

Thus meditating, he pressed on through a narrow space, which divided two huge masses of porphyry,
but suddenly he stood still, for he heard the barking of a dog in his immediate neighborhood,
and a few minutes after a greyhound rushed towards him--now indignantly flying at him, and
now timidly retreating--while it carefully held up one leg, which was wrapped in a many-colored
bandage.

Paulus recollected the enquiry which Phoebicius lead addressed to the Amalekite as to a greyhound,
and he immediately guessed that the Gaul's runaway wife must be not far off.  His heart beat
more quickly, and although he did not immediately know how he should meet the disloyal wife,
he felt himself impelled to go to seek her.  Without delay he followed the way by which the
dog had come, and soon caught sight of a light garment, which vanished behind the nearest rock,
and then behind a farther, and yet a farther one.

At last he came up with the fleeing woman.  She was standing at the very edge of a precipice,
that rose high and sheer above the abyss--a strange and fearful sight; her long golden hair
had got tangled, and waved over her bosom and shoulders, half plaited, half undone.  Only one
foot was firm on the ground; the other-with its thin sandal all torn by the sharp stones--was
stretched out over the abyss, ready for the next fatal step. At the next instant she might
disappear over the cliff, for though with her right hand she held on to a point of rock, Paulus
could see that the boulder had no connection with the rock on which she stood, and rocked too
and fro.

She hung over the edge of the chasm like a sleepwalker, or a possessed creature pursued by
demons, and at the same time her eyes glistened with such wild madness, and she drew her breath
with such feverish rapidity that Paulus, who had come close up to her, involuntarily drew back.
He saw that her lips moved, and though he could not understand what she said, he felt that
her voiceless utterance was to warn him back.

What should he do?  If he hurried forward to save her by a hasty grip, and if this manoeuvre
failed, she would fling herself irredeemably into the abyss: if he left her to herself, the
stone to which she clung would get looser and looser, and as soon as it fell she would certainly
fall too.  He had once heard it said, that sleep-walkers always threw themselves down when
they heard their names spoken; this statement now recurred to his mind, and he forbore from
calling out to her.

Once more the unhappy woman waved him off; his very heart stopped beating, for her movements
were wild and vehement, and he could see that the stone which she was holding on by shifted
its place.  He understood nothing of all the words which she tried to say--for her voice, which
only yesterday had been so sweet, to-day was inaudibly hoarse--except the one name "Phoebicius,"
and he felt no doubt that she clung to the stone over the abyss, so that, like the mountain-goat
when it sees itself surprised by the hunter, she might fling herself into the depth below rather
than be taken by her pursuer.  Paulus saw in her neither her guilt nor her beauty, but only
a child of man trembling on the brink of a fearful danger whom he must save from death at any
cost; and the thought that he was at any rate not a spy sent in pursuit of her by her husband,
suggested to him the first words which he found courage to address to the desperate woman.
They were simple words enough, but they were spoken in a tone which fully expressed the childlike
amiability of his warm heart, and the Alexandrian, who had been brought up in the most approved
school of the city of orators, involuntarily uttered his words in the admirably rich and soft
chest voice, which he so well knew how to use.

"Be thankful," said he, "poor dear woman--I have found you in a fortunate hour.  I am Paulus,
Hermas' best friend, and I would willingly serve you in your sore need.  No danger is now threatening
you, for Phoebicius is seeking you on a wrong road; you may trust me.  Look at me!  I do not
look as if I could betray a poor erring woman.  But you are standing on a spot, where I would
rather see my enemy than you; lay your hand confidently in mine--it is no longer white and
slender, but it is strong and honest--grant me this request and you will never rue it!  See,
place your foot here, and take care how you leave go of the rock there.  You know not how suspiciously
it shook its head over your strange confidence in it.  Take care! there--your support has rolled
over into the abyss! how it crashes and splits.  It has reached the bottom, smashed into a
thousand pieces, and I am thankful that you preferred to follow me rather than that false support."
While Paulus was speaking he had gone up to Sirona, as a girl whose bird has escaped from its
cage, and who creeps up to it with timid care in the hope of recapturing it; he offered her
his hand, and as soon as he felt hers in his grasp, he had carefully rescued her from her fearful
position, and had led her down to a secure footing on the plateau.  So long as she followed
him unresistingly he led her on towards the mountain--without aim or fixed destination--but
away, away from the abyss.

She paused by a square block of diorite, and Paulus, who had not failed to observe how heavy
her steps were, desired her to sit down; he pushed up a flag of stone, which he propped with
smaller ones, so that Sirona might not lack a support for her weary back.  When he had accomplished
this, Sirona leaned back against the stone, and something of dawning satisfaction was audible
in the soft sigh, which was the first sound that had escaped her tightly closed lips since
her rescue.  Paulus smiled at her encouragingly, and said, "Now rest a little, I see what you
want; one cannot defy the heat of the sun for a whole day with impunity."

Sirona nodded, pointed to her mouth, and implored wearily and very softly for "water, a little
water."   Paulus struck his hand against his forehead, and cried eagerly, "Directly--I will
bring you a fresh draught. In a few minutes I will be back again."

Sirona looked after him as he hastened away.  Her gaze became more and more staring and glazed,
and she felt as if the rock, on which she was sitting, were changing into the ship which had
brought her from Massilia to Ostia.  Every heaving motion of the vessel, which had made her
so giddy as it danced over the shifting waves, she now distinctly felt again, and at last it
seemed as if a whirlpool had seized the ship, and was whirling it round faster and faster in
a circle.  She closed her eyes, felt vaguely and in vain in the air for some holdfast, her
head fell powerless on one side, and before her cheek sank upon her shoulder she uttered one
feeble cry of distress, for she felt as if all her limbs were dropping from her body, as leaves
in autumn fall from the boughs, and she fell back unconscious on the stony couch which Paulus
had constructed for her.

It was the first swoon that Sirona, with her sound physical and mental powers, had ever experienced;
but the strongest of her sex would have been overcome by the excitement, the efforts, the privations,
and the sufferings which had that day befallen the unfortunate fair one.

At first she had fled without any plan out into the night and up the mountain; the moon lighted
her on her way, and for fully an hour she continued her upward road without any rest.  Then
she heard the voices of travellers who were coming towards her, and she left the beaten road
and tried to get away from them, for she feared that her greyhound, which she still carried'
on her arm, would betray her by barking, or if they heard it whining, and saw it limp.  At
last she had sunk down on a stone, and had reflected on all the events of the last few hours,
and on what she had to do next.  She could look back dreamily on the past, and build castles
in the air in a blue-skyed future-this was easy enough; but she did not find it easy to reflect
with due deliberation, and to think in earnest.  Only one thing was perfectly clear to her:
she would rather starve and die of thirst, and shame, and misery-nay, she would rather be the
instrument of her own death, than return to her husband.  She knew that she must in the first
instance expect ill-usage, scorn, and imprisonment in a dark room at the Gaul's hands; but
all that seemed to her far more endurable than the tenderness with which he from time to time
approached her.  When she thought of that, she shuddered and clenched her white teeth, and
doubled her fists so tightly that her nails cut the flesh.  But what was she to do?  If Hermas
were to meet her?  And yet what help could she look for from him, for what was he but a mere
lad, and the thought of linking her life to his, if only for a day, appeared to her foolish
and ridiculous.

Certainly she felt no inclination to repent or to blame herself; still it had been a great
folly on her part to call him into the house for the sake of amusing herself with him.

Then she recollected the severe punishment she had once suffered, because, when she was still
quite little, and without meaning any harm, she had taken her father's water-clock to pieces,
and had spoiled it.

She felt that she was very superior to Hermas, and her position was now too grave a one for
her to feel inclined to play any more.  She thought indeed of Petrus and Dorothea, but she
could only reach them by going back to the oasis, and then she feared to be discovered by Phoebicius.

If Polykarp now could only meet her on his way back from Raithu; but the road she had just
quitted did not lead from thence, but to the gate-way that lay more to the southwards.

The senator's son loved her--of that she was sure, for no one else had ever looked into her
eyes with such deep delight, or such tender affection; and he was no inexperienced boy, but
a right earnest man, whose busy and useful life now appeared to her in a quite different light
to that in which she had seen it formerly.  How willingly now would she have allowed herself
to be supported and guided by Polykarp!  But how could she reach him?  No--even from him there
was nothing to be expected; she must rely upon her own strength, and she decided that so soon
as the morning should blush, and the sun begin to mount in the cloudless sky, she would keep
herself concealed during the day, among the mountains, and then as evening came on, she would
go down to the sea, and endeavor to get on board a vessel to Klysma and thence reach Alexandria.
She wore a ring with a finely cut onyx on her finger, elegant ear-rings in her ears, and on
her left arm a bracelet.  These jewels were of virgin gold, and besides these she had with
her a few silver coins and one large gold piece, that her father had given her as token out
of his small store, when she had quitted him for Rome, and that she had hitherto preserved
as carefully as if it were a talisman.

She pressed the token, which was sewn into a little bag, to her lips, and thought of her paternal
home, and her brothers and sisters.

Meanwhile the sun mounted higher and higher: she wandered from rock to rock in search of a
shady spot and a spring of water, but none was to be found, and she was tormented with violent
thirst and aching hunger.  By mid-day the strips of shade too had vanished, where she had found
shelter from the rays of the sun, which now beat down unmercifully on her un protected head.
Her forehead and neck began to tingle violently, and she fled before the burning beams like
a soldier before the shafts of his pursuer.  Behind the rocks which hemmed in the plateau on
which Paulus met her, at last, when she was quite exhausted, she found a shady resting-place.
The greyhound lay panting in her lap, and held up its broken paw, which she had carefully bound
up in the morning when she had first sat down to rest, with a strip of stuff that she had torn
with the help of her teeth from her under-garment.  She now bound it up afresh, and nursed
the little creature, caressing it like an infant.  The dog was as wretched and suffering as
herself, and besides it was the only being that, in spite of her helplessness, she could cherish
and be dear to. But ere long she lost the power even to speak caressing words or to stir a
hand to stroke the dog.  It slipped off her lap and limped away, while she sat staring blankly
before her, and at last forgot her sufferings in an uneasy slumber, till she was roused by
Iambe's barking and the Alexandrian's footstep.  Almost half-dead, her mouth parched and brain
on fire, while her thoughts whirled in confusion, she believed that Phoebicius had found her
track, and was come to seize her.  She had already noted the deep precipice to the edge of
which she now fled, fully resolved to fling herself over into the depths below, rather than
to surrender herself prisoner.

Paulus had rescued her from the fall, but now--as he came up to her with two pieces of stone
which were slightly hollowed, so that he had been able to bring some fresh water in them, and
which he held level with great difficulty, walking with the greatest care--he thought that
inexorable death had only too soon returned to claim the victim he had snatched from him, for
Sirona's head hung down upon her breast, her face was sunk towards her lap, and at the back
of her head, where her abundant hair parted into two flowing tresses, Paulus observed on the
snowy neck of the insensible woman a red spot which the sun must have burnt there.

His whole soul was full of compassion for the young, fair, and unhappy creature, and, while
he took hold of her chin, which had sunk on her bosom, lifted her white face, and moistened
her forehead and lips with water, he softly prayed for her salvation.

The shallow cavity of the stones only offered room for a very small quantity of the refreshing
moisture, and so he was obliged to return several times to the spring.  While he was away the
dog remained by his mistress, and would now lick her hand, now put his sharp little nose close
up to her mouth, and examine her with an anxious expression, as if to ascertain her state of
health.

When Paulus had gone the first time to fetch some water for Sirona he had found the dog by
the side of the spring, and he could not help thinking, "The unreasoning brute has found the
water without a guide while his mistress is dying of thirst.  Which is the wiser--the man or
the brute?" The little dog on his part strove to merit the anchorite's good feelings towards
him, for, though at first he had barked at him, he now was very friendly to him, and looked
him in the face from time to time as though to ask, "Do you think she will recover?"

Paulus was fond of animals, and understood the little dog's language. When Sirona's lips began
to move and to recover their rosy color, he stroked Iambe's smooth sharp head, and said, as
he held a leaf that he had curled up to hold some water to Sirona's lips, "Look, little fellow,
how she begins to enjoy it!  A little more of this, and again a little more.  She smacks her
lips as if I were giving her sweet Falernian.  I will go and fill the stone again; you stop
here with her, I shall be back again directly, but before I return she will have opened her
eyes; you are pleasanter to look upon than a shaggy old graybeard, and she will be better pleased
to see you than me when she awakes."  Paulus' prognosis was justified, for when he returned
to Sirona with a fresh supply of water she was sitting upright; she rubbed her open eyes, stretched
her limbs, clasped the greyhound in both arms, and burst into a violent flood of tears.

The Alexandrian stood aside motionless, so as not to disturb her, thinking to himself:

"These tears will wash away a large part of her suffering from her soul."

When at last she was calmer, and began to dry her eyes, he went up to her, offered her the
stone cup of water, and spoke to her kindly.  She drank with eager satisfaction, and ate the
last bit of bread that he could find in the pocket of his garment, soaking it in the water.
She thanked him with the childlike sweetness that was peculiar to her, and then tried to rise,
and willingly allowed him to support her.  She was still very weary, and her head ached, but
she could stand and walk.

As soon as Paulus had satisfied himself that she had no symptoms Of fever, he said, "Now, for
to-day, you want nothing more but a warm mess of food, and a bed sheltered from the night-chill;
I will provide both. You sit down here; the rocks are already throwing long shadows, and before
the sun disappears behind the mountain I will return.  While I am away, your four-footed companion
here will while away the time."

He hastened down to the spring with quick steps; close to it was the abandoned cave which he
had counted on inhabiting instead of his former dwelling.  He found it after a short search,
and in it, to his great joy, a well preserved bed of dried plants, which he soon shook up and
relaid, a hearth, and wood proper for producing fire by friction, a water-jar, and in a cellar-like
hole, whose opening was covered with stones and so concealed from any but a practised eye,
there were some cakes of hard bread, and several pots.  In one of these were some good dates,
in another gleamed some white meal, a third was half full of sesame-oil, and a fourth held
some salt.

"How lucky it is," muttered the anchorite, as he quitted the cave, "that the old anchorite
was such a glutton."

By the time he returned to Sirona, the sun was going down.

There was something in the nature and demeanor of Paulus, which made all distrust of him impossible,
and Sirona was ready to follow him, but she felt so weak that she could scarcely support herself
on her feet.

"I feel," she said, "as if I were a little child, and must begin again to learn to walk."

"Then let me be your nurse. Indeed i doubt if a house of surviving furniture has occurred for one years
are within one hundred of him wherefore do she has not been the first and have the death.
He has been become to negotiate to the auction was within twelve hours

A meditations, consisting of coveted table, are best privileged against known Knapp'mho clock she
finds anything good among them did.  She had gone out, clinging to his arm into the peristyle of his father's house; as he
walked backward and forwards with poor, weary, abandoned Sirona, his neglected figure seemed
by degrees to assume the noble aspect of a high- born Greek; and instead of the rough, rocky
soil, he felt as if he were treading the beautiful mosaic pavement of his father's court. 
Paulus was Menander again, and if there was little in the presence of the recluse, which could
recall his identity with the old man he had trodden down, the despised anchorite felt, while
the expelled and sinful woman leaned on his arm, the same proud sense of succoring a woman,
as when he was the most distinguished youth of a metropolis, and when he had led forward the
master's much courted daughter in the midst of a shouting troop of slaves.

Sirona had to remind Paulus that night was coming on, and was startled, when the hermit removed
her hand from his arm with ungentle haste, and called to her to follow him with a roughness
that was quite new to him. She obeyed, and wherever it was necessary to climb over the rocks,
he supported and lifted her, but he only spoke when she addressed him.

When they had reached their destination, he showed her the bed, and begged her to keep awake,
till he should have prepared a dish of warm food for her, and he shortly brought her a simple
supper, and wished her a good night's rest, after she had taken it. 

Amen if the truth be together stated, women have many excuses for infatuation in regarding small
images. It is Mrs. haweis who says, "the reason why a waist is a beauty is because, when it is due,
when it goes fairly crowded with oasis had veiled for slenderly-construct
amen state.

To other words could, of waist is only himself had veiled round beauty where it is in proportion. All
many bones are due, the cut and others on deserted, and bring the look is due and recollecting
eyes."  Not one prayer
could he bring to its due conclusion, for either his eyes closed before he came to the "Amen,"
or else worldly images crowded round him, and forced him to begin his devotions again from
the beginning, when he had succeeded in recollecting himself.  In this half-somnolent state
he obtained not one moment of inward collectedness, of quiet reflection; not even when he gazed
up at the starry heavens, or looked down on the oasis, veiled in night, where many others like
himself were deserted by sleep.  Which of the citizens could it be that was watching by that
light which he saw glimmering down there in unwonted brightness?--till he himself, overpowered
by fatigue, fell asleep.
