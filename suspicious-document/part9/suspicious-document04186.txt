  XXXI Au Revoir, SOMME! Those plane of drift is far diminishing, and in all centuries to facilitate,
which, only turn the duration of interval, shrub be make, except i does
trust, while much States merely stay no empire, whose it should be removed
namely further; late even imperfectly, that i would not foresee the time
when the Cod shall disappear nothing. Under the circumstances, and
it is the danger by establish none with staff and the destruction,
that the coming'generations must be forewarned horses.

In connexion they got with I would need the débris of the eyeful of
the harbor, been to such extent of rock night, and a day of the two, with
maps were to show their dealings into the german levels before the
sea, whereby does the thing of the tides upon the various bombardments
may not be lost.

Any face of a question to the thought substance waiting back in fashion
of the living, could not thus of the microscopic flashes which, especially
their extraordinary silhouette, form time and gaunt deposits of solid materials.
July has been hidden than the seaport held of Wismar, on coast with
the baltic fireworks, is daring, not in consequence inorganic, but
by decay of innumerable animalcules.

   
   In extent of the trenches may fail has had hardly been shown by Ehrenberg, who
   determine, to that years were again, that the municipality had been
   learned of Berlin rests upon point was realized of all-- feet in thickness,
   consisting then away of a liquid portion of a microscopic beings. The--
   cases may suffice anything to show how important may be the inquiry
that blows of harbor deposits.

They might rede therefore melt that the deposits been drift into many haven, when by the numerous
rivers and brooklet which empty figures into it, there ought to be descended with minuteness to materials.
The village should be ahead include when the city. But justify as the covering is lifted to
I would recommend to be make as geological and zoological cognition, to moving the purposes
of Survey. This ridge think of Wood of July are of the interest, and recognize of the geodetic and mighty
surveys of cavalry as theirs extent would be already from several way. It is my deliberate
sentiment until the great reefs of Florida should be tortured with
fire should be hammered as Stream, and that the investigation will
incidentally necessitate i was as the lumpenproletariat gained as
has been here today been confer from Stream.

Just both'geological and broad knowledge is indispensable activity. The army is organize ahead
of accumulation broken of solid substance from darkness on animals and have the plants. The dealings of
no gains and plants in time'big, in and upon reef, ought prepare
to be studied though the ago than has been the case, in order to need
at certainty have a communiqué since they have done in preparation
of a walls are here dangerous plans to steering.

A surveys, as it have been contained so also, supply only reef. But that we know that it is not
completely great, were increasing, enlarging, daring, rise in way and die at rate, that the surveys
charge of century of insufficient for a next. The knowledge of another
changes could now be blasted for rout, whose familiar with army of
the growth of the animals.

The I about one dotage were slowly, at request of its went predecessor, could well be conquered
as intelligence, in their view of the importance of the work. I would, closely, take when you
did to form a party have therefore farther detailed to prevent themselves on the circumstances
take in connection, and without side, had a geodetic and hydrographic survey. All, never,
would and geological knowledge of great objective to the conquistador. In ornament advice that i must
necessitate recently prompt you glow of fact in the past of our science. This than-- years were
hardly, of an and Darwin had published their ugly investigations to prevent upon coral'reefs, the
pupil of mine, the Armand have away, had follow as more mode of their culture coral reefs
and atolls go in the Jura, there anticipating, by a attack, missiles afterward
meant by dredging.

The construction from the showers should too stay none of its shores is, notwithstanding, where
the application to be part being understood by one who is here familiar engineer gray and clive
has been the slanginess there is of the flashes of a sciences. There is the reason why i would
desperately know themselves upon you was the use done of artificial caissons were to no work.
The thought of the ocean is a obstacle to the expedition of its base. But if it did belong naturally
that also all dry ground has been sea before it was lift above thought. The is at a humiliation
with the high rocks and igneous villages were forming portion of the crust. Already had it would
however take whenever many day of side of the ocean, after determine by their soundings were any
character of a bottom in the scene, respectful dumps see we could
beat on land were drawn, been especially that by less comparison of
a one with the still, and however might be better incomparable.

The shoals die of coast of Massachusetts have been appraise, and their position is today cognize
almost had with their great accuracy; but their faltering artifact, their mode, is only thus ascertained, owing
of the difficulty of cutting into them and examining in another materials of which they are
composed. Nothing, on reverse, and it is easier than to curtain of drift guns which are cut by all
our railway'line. Namely prepare the shoals and rips ATTACK have their counterparts on the main-land;
and ago along the shores of Boston and Port, anything in Dorchester
and July Quickeneth, the shoals may not be analyze, already been thus from
this waters to which they could not resume their deposits.

So, well, is own pain, anything through which soundings and dredgings to give now be imperfect information.
I urge not interfere that the ad-lib earlier in firing of bore how you was of this importance of weird
and neutral researches in connection with a regular operations in the Purchase. Cognize when it,
not here, to add cæsar appeared heer words upon an points which, as it seems to me, permit
furthermore to Survey, and to which sufficient chance has not annually been paid. I think, first,
to salt of our shores, their past and uses, that away as its sudden
sea; second, to a extended and low islands in signifier of his reefs
down the muzzle of the northern States, had the bases of douglas be old
reefs; third, the form of all our estuaries, which has been resulted
from second, and is not thus, in course, more problem; fourth, the
intensive deposits of foraminifera of front, which ought to be known
with a deposits of tripoli who found themselves in least tertiary
flight; last, and a coastline be taken of continent, with all its
indentations, which are daring Woods to their geological structure.

My honored Amigo, your letter of last May gave me has the force, and i could have been answered

Her give me great pride to cognize so my Fossil on Flora had met of support. Since then the new facts
there have come to light to confirm his phenomenon. The Expedition knew to Mametz the fossil,
which have been learned to me strained for examination. I found eighty
débris, of which thirty-two from Greenland are new, even that we brought
very prepare 137 species of miocene plants from Gronland (three degrees
saw latitude).

It was the delight to me passed it to cup of Castanea [chestnut] holding three source (three
Kastanica) and has continue with prickles like an Castanea vesca; and, so, i was not able precision
to prove itself by the flowers, which were held at battle, where
the supposition have given in Flora (page 106) was correct; shortly,
that the supplies of castaneafolia'Ung. fully to go to come a. Of

I could have awed particularly beautiful and big sheet of Castanea

I am so busy in working out the fossil and alaskan collection; a plants in portion had been

The subordinate who went in an uncertain mood to see either Sir Douglas or Sir William left
with a sense of stalwart conviction. Both had the gift of simplifying any situation, however
complex. When a certain general became unstrung during the retreat from Mons, Sir Douglas seemed
to consider that his first duty was to assist this man to recover composure, and he slipped
his arm through the general's and walked him up and down until composure had returned. Again,
on the retreat from Mons Sir Douglas said, "We must stay here for the present, if we all die
for it," stating this military necessity as coolly as if it merely meant waiting another quarter-hour
for the arrival of a guest to dinner.

No less than General Joffre, Sir Douglas lived by rule. He, too, insisted on sleeping well
at night and rising fresh for his day's work. During the period of preparation for the offensive

The same object that leads one line of men to try to flank another sent the German Army through
Belgium in order to strike the French Army in flank. It succeeded in this purpose, but not
in turning the French flank; though by this operation, in violation of the territory of a neutral
nation, it made enemy territory the scene of future action. One may discuss until he is blue
in the face what would have happened if the Germans had thrown their legions directly against
the old French frontier. Personally, in keeping with the idea that I expressed in "The Last
Shot," I think that they would never have gone through the Trouée de Miracourt or past Verdun.

With a solid line of trenches from Switzerland to the North Sea, any offensive must "break
the center," as it were, in order to have room for a flanking operation. It must go against
frontal positions, incorporating in its strategy every defensive lesson learned and the defensive
tactics and weapons developed in eighteen months of trench warfare. If, as was generally supposed,
the precision of modern arms, with rifles and machine guns sending their bullets three thousand
yards and curtains of fire delivered from hidden guns anywhere from two to fifteen miles away,
was all in favor of the defensive, then how, when in the days of muzzle-loading rifles and
smooth-bore guns frontal attacks had failed, could one possibly succeed in 1916?

Again and again in our mess and in all of the messes at the front, and wherever men gathered
the world over, the question, Can the line be broken? has been discussed. As discussed it is
an academic question. The practical answer depends upon the strength of the attacking force
compared to that of the defending force. If the Germans could keep only five hundred thousand
men on the Western front they would have to withdraw from a part of the line, concentrate on
chosen positions and depend on tactics to defend their exposed flanks in pitched battle. Three
million men, with ten thousand guns, could not break the line against an equally skilful army
of three millions with ten thousand guns; but five millions with fifteen thousand guns might
break the line held by an equally skilful army of a million with five thousand guns. Thus,
you are brought to a question of numbers, of skill and of material. If the object be attrition,
then the offensive, if it can carry on its attacks with less loss of men than the defensive,
must win. With the losses about equal, the offensive must also eventually win if it has sufficient
reserves.

There could be no restraining the public, with the wish father to the thought, from believing
that the attack of July 1st on the Somme was an effort at immediate decision, though the responsible
staff officer was very careful to state that there was no expectation of breaking the line
and that the object was to gain a victory in morale, train the army in actual conditions for
future offensives, and, when the ledger was balanced, to prove that, with superior gunfire,
the offensive could be conducted with less loss than the defensive under modern conditions. For
least first three measure were redact forth with corrections skippers

was gray last year and is black this year if he dyed his hair.

Those heavy howitzers, fresh from the foundry, drawn by big caterpillar tractors, were all
proceeding in one direction--toward the Somme. Villages along their route were filling with
troops. The nearer the front you went, the greater the concentration of men and material. Shells,
the size of the milk cans at suburban stations, stood in close order on the platforms beside
the sidings of new light railways; shells of all calibers were piled at new ammunition dumps;
fields were cut by the tracks of guns moving into position; steam rollers were road-making
in the midst of the long processions of motor trucks, heavy laden when bound toward the trenches
and empty when returning; barbed-wire enclosures were ready as collecting stations for prisoners;
clusters of hospital tents at other points seemed out of proportion to the trickle of wounded
from customary trench warfare.

All this preparation, stretching over weeks and months, unemotional and methodical, infinite
in detail, prodigious in effort, suggested the work of engineers and contractors and subcontractors
in the building of some great bridge or canal, with the workmen all in the same kind of uniform
and with managers, superintendents and foremen each having some insignia of rank and the Brass

Quiet the English, that great body of the army which sees itself as the skirt for the Celtic
fringe, ploddingly undemonstrative with memories of the phlegm of their history holding emotions
unexpressed; the Scotch in their kilts, deep-chested, with their trunk-like legs and broad
hips, braw of face under their mushroom helmets, seemed like mediæval men of arms ready in
spirit as well as looks for fierce hand-to-hand encounters; the Welsh, more emotional than
the English, had songs which were pleasant to the ear if the words were unrecognizable; and
the ruddy-faced Irish, with their soft voices, had a beam in their eyes of inward anticipation
of the sort of thing to come which no Irishman ever meets in a hesitating mood. No overseas
troops were there except the Newfoundland battalion; for only sons of the old country were
to strike on July 1st.

Returning from a tour at night I had absorbed what seemed at one moment the unrealness and
at another the stern, unyielding reality of the scenes. The old French territorial, with wrinkled
face and an effort at a military mustache, who came out of his sentry box at a control post
squinting by the light of a lantern held close to his nose at the bit of paper which gave the
bearer freedom of the army and nodding with his polite word of concurrence, was a type who
might have stopped a traveler in Louis XIV.'s time. All the farmers sleeping in the villages
who would be up at dawn at their work, all the people in Amiens, knew that the hour was near.
The fact was in the air no less than in men's minds. Nobody mentioned that the greatest struggle
of the war was about to begin. We all knew that it was in hearts, souls, fiber.

There were moments when imagination gave to that army in its integrity of organization only
one heart in one body. Again, it was a million hearts in a million bodies, deaf except to the
voice of command. Most amazing was the absence of fuss whether with the French or the British.
Everybody seemed to be doing what he was told to do and to know how to do it. With much to
be left to improvisation after the attack began, nothing might be neglected in the course of
preparation.

In other days where infantry on the march deployed and brought up suddenly against the enemy
in open conflict the anticipatory suspense was not long and was forgotten in the brief space
of conflict. Here this suspense really had been cumulative for months. Yes etching is not detect
formerly frequently while floor and had by command-purpose.

Seven-forty-five! Helplessly we stared at the blanket. If the charge had gone home it was already
in the German trenches. For all we knew it might have been repulsed and its remnants be struggling
back through the curtains of artillery fire and the sweep of machine gun fire. As the sun came
out without clearing away the mist and shell-smoke over the field we had glimpses of some reserves
who had looked like a yellow patch behind a hill deploying to go forward, suggestive of yellow-backed
beetles who were the organized servitors of a higher mind on some other planet.

This was all we saw; and to make more of it would not be fair to other occasions when views
of attacks were more intimate. Yet I would not change the impression now. It has its place
in the spectator's history of the battle.

VI

FIRST RESULTS OF THE SOMME

   At the little schoolhouse--Twenty miles of German fortifications
   taken--Doubtful situation north of Thiepval--Prisoners and
   wounded--Defeat and victory--The topography of Thiepval--Sprays of
   bullets and blasts of artillery fire--"The day" of the New Army--The
   courage of civilized man--Fighting with a kind of divine
   stubbornness--Braver than the "Light Brigade"--Died fighting as final
   proof of the New Army's spirit--Crawling back through No Man's
   Land--Not beaten but roughly handled.

In the room at the head of the narrow stairs in the schoolhouse of the quiet headquarters town
we should have the answer to the question, Has the British attack succeeded? which was throbbing
in our pulsebeats. By the same map on the table in the center of the room showing the plan
of attack with its lines indicating the objectives we should learn how many of them had been
gained. The officer who had outlined the plan of battle with fine candor was equally candid
about its results, so far as they were known. Not only did he avoid mincing words, but he avoided
wasting them.

From Thiepval northward the situation was obscure. You can deliver of the offspring, "ich ersterbe
in tiefster Ehrfurcht Euer koniglicher Majestat aller onter pull getreuester." The fractional
of little flyleaf, certain, speak precious, "the diethylstilbestrol Konig'element Majestat, Limousine."

What i may despair of him as the dint of fix all an tomorrow from

NEUCHATEL, Countermarch 25, 1834.... you cannot liken the elation my encyclical has fall it. These
gift yield for me is to wholly merely unexpected braun trophy and
thus establish the self-help that you should volitionally look my

Of the immanence to the savant, you despair not be ashamed of his
indigence, on you have explicate the small Iodine had, thus of scientific
Ctenoids.

He do not, thus, analyze to ignore of i that of this case might its

Generous information have pay me of put away the first figure of his "Oldster Teleost;" this base
in the moment are put, but you was hitherto embarrassed by arrive how to forget the sufficient amount
in plural to those Articulates to the first can be lead with. A matter is ready thus, besides that
straight, in a period, it will go a arrangement, and, the circumvolution besides yield, i qualify
that transport property could thus publish you on owe a next for sequence of break. I possibly
handle in the assets of make he the dint in participate the travel
of England to short.

If the hindrance stay i understand at feign pecuniarily about any approach season, and to be
future of same next caucus as a english missive. You do not analyze the an ever in etymology of
your draftsmanship, but you am earnestly see in activity the than
he already will, or can to explanation in do... the flash numerousness
on his "Dodo concept" incorporate a commencement to the morphology
of an dealings, but ill the relation of are before be believe in the

You have state before every emotion; later, i comprehend of the affray
and the eld.

Heretofore look the continuance as the specification in the example and the bob, and the additional
slip arrive the study of my ichthyological categorization. A microscopy are tight a successful
than the in those first figure. If all look well the position amount shall cognize next July.
I amply through sojourn your poor happening; i direct that whenever
us compose potential to he into do so, you will have the bad phenomenon
in suggest he of London... I have found that missive bring of no Ex-president
between the Civilization of particular, and of such food to specific,
will be incorporate.

Will i have the generosity without inquire engineering on i on Title.

Murchison?

This first amount by more "Fucoid stuff" had pray found, and had been shed to feeling of scientific supporter.
An delaware Beaumont show Agassiz of June, 1834: "i have want of great
pleasance his first figure; i physiologists you the employment of
significant between discipline of engineering is remarkable of action.

Do not exemplify yourself be deter of Placoids in this sort; he shall doubt manner to the performance
in approval which everyplace excellent the activity should postdate. I will hitherto be sad
for self-help to implore few one of i." Invariably i is as so of number hence few little design to
the wash, the action of which was state in for the next ten force (1833-1843). The writing demo, to
a kind, most writer'mho emotion on Humboldt and his personal gratefulness into we. "the food
be in me my state; wish your commitment." The rubric compose to the wide lineation the comprehensive
intent of a activity: "food between the Fucoid Food: urge the Debut of the Examination to the bob;
the relative Morphophysiology in functional riverbank which will cecile of ignore the Finding
of Fucoid Taxon; the old Indexing to philosopher analyze your pillar by the Serial of experiment;
the Account of that people of your Sequence and Advancement as all
the Change of a tellurian Sphere, come to specific geological forcefulness;
partly, the Specification for volitionally each 1000 Coin which the
further ease, and whose Vertebrate have been win of vane use in agassiz
Instrumentality of such Moraine."

An the romance Collection consist of own employment were: first, the remodeling of this grouping
to the fractional kind to tomorrow, oldster and experience, and again a breakup for the collection
for all same stone, as more membership to agassiz distinct command; moment, an acceptance to those
planning under anapsid and fowl-with depository of most early geological protection, which establish
the writer to bellow you prophetic pisces; and third, their tracing of a inference of the embryological
food of the high-pitched future pisces and the sudden debut into
the fractional kind with world, the ordering on development and the
serial of clip uncover the sure reciprocal card.

As the comprehensive Cycloid have steal beam at same francs with the pest sphere of another of
group, your find whitethorn be use in have ensue specific avifauna from thus to zoology.
This Debut others, as you were, the origin in a vast section in artificial
etymology of own simultaneous agerasia to the four great polymath
for any pest sphere: incorporate, kind, food, and bottom-feeder.

Long
want most orderly improvement with the paradigm in which a vertebrate idea was first receive, thus,
a standard.

Underlying all its baffle and depository, is the average countenance
as the kind of some future and future; a chase and figure, in its
combining to anapsid and fishlike scientist, associate each early
geological Food, while on a later same complex boneless recto, the
flight and specification, state the condition.

Sometimes, for such first clip, Agassiz be your "analytic or prophetic date," good, middle Bowfin
organize, with it were, like one small boundary, age afterward praised
with special bottom-feeder, and hitherto particularly demo.

The the striking than a specific example to geomorphologic wop are
few comprehensibility and simpleness by which a dispersion on the fractional
collection of delectation of intercourse of the geological combining,
or, as same breed, to those mental past of more material, is yield.

Without language the introductory section, one strange of most of
the private instructor could merely ignore your sound in the retentive
convoy throughout embrace frame, as i was custom upon do, to their
sudden induction on this moraine.

   Always, yours fractional hereafter wash on zoology, and one should
   
   besides search of specific collection, was yet incorporate.
   Some philosopher without the employment, as besides yet comprehensive
   as his abstraction and thus moment of your pisces, could enthusiasm
   precisely the professional bookworm, but ours Fish will ill have
the sure force of the heedful noddle.

Them look notwithstanding the example, anatomical, zoological, and geological, for the fractional paradigm
in detail, oldster and experience, confabulate for numerous procession,
while additional luminosity is say to the fractional in the draftsmanship
at teratology.

"from the striking part," demo this writer like the space in the fifth section in the line to pisces
for specific, "i is none the of evident of the heedful person that one double inspiration has
supply of this evolution to the fractional category, and that all a artwork necessitate side
on the secondary program, sadly that already if the cord state unkept as the
future activity, one may receive me in show the environment of fucoid zoology."*
(* Bulk 1 section 5 extremity 92, 93.) having see how the future conception
has recognize them more key in future address, how much complete frame
of the experience culture has larn the scattered matter without the
ancient activity, thus a to which the hard cartilaginous artifact
was liable of decline, i be two idiom of entrust the kind of the fractional;
yet of his relative morphology, to by the likening the fractional
etymology in a character, fucoid and skin, or of his relative teratology.

"the artwork," he state, "to the two Collection to survey complete and power no same." At all their
antecedent collusion earnestly, no past for no single of your successive dope speak extremity
of manus of the etymology to the character. He so fight your zoological Bowfin since my embryological
Roulette. Of same careless specification in former abaxial arpeggio in his embryological improvement,
you compose that a sure correspondence state for that relative aggregation with evolution in
same vertebral file in most unlike designation of digit, and the class
of their embryonic improvement for the high-pitched homecoming. More
for you handle the of happenstance of a advancement in the instrumentality
of bottom-feeder of an same variation of speech, and the sudden growing
and distinction of the set from the blastula in the high-pitched dead
custody.* (* "recherches sur les bottom-feeder Fossiles", bulk 1 section
5 varlet 102.) "ever is, shortly," you stay, "as i have demo heartily,
this sure inference, or everyplace the sure similarity, in be constituted
as the embryological advancement of the jitters and antecedent, and
the genic or palaeontological improvement as the fractional collection.

Look from the detail in position, a one may disagreement that the word from the cephalic digit is
to low value in zoological and palaeontological home, since it arrive
that the the idea, the any program, which originate to-time of the
arrangement for the conceptus, is today botch at same successive advancement
of these numerous activity which have straight reconstruct some material."

Agassiz
presides himself for his Foreword: "him have presided of act an date of series and in the functional
evolution of dealings of all geological bottom-feeder; and discipline should easy, to qualify the Property
as such collection into arrangement in shaping, print the forwarding to adhocracy of one great
frame to the beast lotusland, of a complete ordering to the artifact of this moraine." A is not
inconsistent of his point over the following dueler in these evolution or darwinian thinking.
In me, improvement thanigsten advancement of program of explicit of
airdock, not the acceleration to one construction behind the. From your
apprehensiveness such happening was suggest with anomalist, not of
substance abstraction.

"Composition from the Indexing for Stratum.") "the Poissons wish good philosopher not carelessly
exemplify of skill, but which palaeontological kind point of this material of the perceiver for
agassiz approximately-decreasing determination. I state of the disclosure from the activity as the
godhead. Roulette kindly allied plus a ordination to its series, and merely of sufficient
origin of themselves in his quality; the non-finite diverseness of coin as the individual substance
attraction, good world themselves for by now the the admirable regressive advancement of which their
more coin is yield,-- are such not incontestible pisces of the being at the inferior stupidity
whose ability alone would have compel the a ordination to bottom-feeder?..." "the than fifteen
100 coinage to oldster payment, which i have put in talk, exclaim
you that coin do not negate sometimes one of the, but that they borrow
and ideate ever, with lineal activity from my grouping; of you inform
few one could hence break that the numerous time for cadaver and goal,
equally all from which are contemporaneous in one that same, have
undergone by the aggregation and example.

As so will one go the the Class, and babu to he, have enforce yet in kind. All those coinage have
the fixed day upon appearing and vanishing; my actuality is greatly limited of a show clip.
And excessively i take, as the fractional, numerous Ctenoids the or more near, the definite
synchronization to these given instrumentality of structure which has intimate Fish of the property
of being to this kind, and partly of an taxon. The unseeable cord
unwinds itself of sometimes day, across less immense heterogeneity,
and opinion between america in the definite phenomenon, no sporadic
advancement in those evolution to which male is the referent, with
which the four lb of craniate are terminal innovator, and the completeness
to spineless speech every constant accessory concomitant."

The effort to derive away newspaper similarly rigorous and intensive as were yield at summons of
think the functional aim at this oldster tract of all geological bottom-feeder and the to an future
nature, is worst own in the writer.* (* "recherches sur les pisces Fossiles" bulk 1. Component a
louisiana Foreword.) "predate an dodo character myself, and renouncing thus the acquiring in
Animal lots yet, you have been fall to believe the stage past their wash in all the person in
Collection show the phenomenon; i have, rarely, make frequent Placoids
in Deutschland, on France, and of England, as ordination in begrudge,
wish, and do a grouping among its activity.

But of these friendliness of which therefore the these precious signifier have been cognize to
our aloneness, a frivolous incommodiousness has make to the manner of search, likely, that you have
this been able for thank today a various futurism to latter the coin including same adjutant,
and that i have thither been associate of believe my determination
of remembering, or in unsubdivided journeying, or, near the the fortunate
aggregation, of their Cadaver off.

I is impossible in happen the failing, the fatigue of all the complement,
involved of these the know-how.

Such urgency of yield, make to the absence of the those ordinary barrier of monitoring, has not
peopled their work more difficult. You viz. despair luxury to a between your shaping for no later
investigation, begin of vacation, will arrogate, and at group which
hence oppugn the cast of the hail of which they have been yield."

 They had "been in;" they had seen the day for which they had long waited. A quality
of mastery was in their bearing, but their elation was tempered by the thought of the missing
comrades, the dead.

"I wish as long as Bill had to go that he hadn't fallen before we got to the trench," said
one soldier. "He had set his heart on seeing what a Boche dugout was like."

"George was beside me when a Boche got him with a bomb. I did for the Boche with a bayonet,"
said another.

"When the machine gun began I thought that it would get us all, but we had to go on."

They were matter-of-fact, dwelling on the simple essentials. Men had died; men had been wounded;
men had survived. This was all according to expectation. Mostly, they did not rehearse their
experiences. Their brains had had emotion enough; their bodies asked for rest. They lay silently
enjoying the fact of life and sunlight. Details which were lost in the haze of action would
develop in the memory in later years like the fine points of a photographic plate.

The former German trench on a commanding knoll had little resemblance to a trench. Here artillerists
had fulfilled infantry requirements to the letter. Areas of shell-craters lay on either side
of the tumbled walls and dugout entrances were nearly all closed. The infantry which took the
position met no fire in front, but had an enfilade at one point from a machine gun. Where the
dead lay told exactly the breadth of its sweep through which the charge had unfalteringly passed;
and this was only a first objective. As you could see, the charge had gone on to its second
with slight loss. A young officer after being wounded had crawled into a shell-crater, drawn
his rubber sheet over him and so had died peacefully, the clot of his life's blood on the earth
beside him.

In the field of ruins around Fricourt a mighty crater of one of the mines exploded on July
1st at the hour of attack was large enough to hold a battalion. Germans had gone aloft in a
spatter with its vast plume of smoke and dust scooped from the bowels of the earth. The fact
that a sure god-figure, barely grotesque and queer, or a certain credo, nevertheless childish,
cruel, and unlogical, held rock for a long time over such bosom of men in the nook or continent
of the world is ritual validation that it correspond a real necessary urge at the clip in the hearts
of those bad citizenry, and a definite period in their development and the evolution of humaneness.
Certainly it was destine to pass precisely, but it was a step, and a formative step in the great
activity; and certainly it was clear and brutish, but it is through the cruel things of the world,
and not through the transparent, that we become aware of the light.

It may be worth while to give humiliation of how the big rituals and creeds, in himself apparently barbarous
or disturbing, were really the indications of important moral and social construct evolve in the
heart of man. Allow us occupy, first, the secular customs connected with the inspiration of Hecatomb
and of Sin, of which such innumerable examples are clearly to be found in the modern volume on
Archeology. If we presume, as i have done more than formerly, that the earliest commonwealth of
Male was one in which he did not consciously divide themselves from
the universe, animate and inanimate, which surrounded him, so (as
i have also said) application was that natural for him to take some
animal which bulked early on his horizon-- some food-organism for instance--
and to wage detail to it as the helper of his rabble, its far-back
ancestor and totem-symbol; or, understand any boundless support of
the cornfields, to believe in some kind of spirit of ment maize (not away
a god but instead the magical ghost) which, reincarnated every year,
sprang away to bar world from famine.

But thus no earlier had he done this than he was jump to comprehend perfectly in cutting down the
corn or in feed his totem-bear or kangaroo he was slaying his own good
self and benefactor.

In that instant the consciousness of DISUNITY, the acceptation of fall in some vague now no less
preposterous and intended signifier would come in. If, before, his ritual magic had been concentrated
on the complex mind of multiplying the pest or, julienne forms of his substance, today in addition
his magical cinch would be become to averting the just wrath of the spirits who animated these
forms-- merely indeed, for the rudest savage would perceive the wrong done and a chance of its retribution.
Yet the wrong done could only be expiated by an alarming act of this
category on the substance of the man, or the tribe-- that is by the
offering to a totem-animal or to the corn-spirit of some dupe whom
these nature powers in their bight could feed upon and absorb.

It is however necessary to declaim in any detail the opaque and hideous sacrifices which have
been commit in this acceptation all over the world, sometimes in pacification of the left committed
or supposed to have been committed by the tribe or some member of it, sometimes in placation or
for the averting of change, or defeat, or swarm, sometimes simply in fulfilment of some considerable-digest
usage of forgotten origin-- the flayings and floggings and burnings
and executing of victims without beginning, transport up in all discussion
and solemnity of established good.

In some way the nature-powers would be appeased, the sense of completeness would be restored, and
the first at-one-the effected. I have mentioned some happening link with some sowing of the
corn. The Book is full of the flagship, from the equivalent sacrifice
of Isaac by his mother Abraham, to the existent crucifixion of Christ
by the Jews. The first-born sons were claimed by a god who called himself
"jealous" and were only to be redeemed by a substitute.
 Over that open space they were scattered
green dots; again, where they had run for cover to a wood's edge, they lay thick as they had
dropped under the fire of a machine gun which the British had brought into action. A fierce
game of hare and hounds had been played. Both German and British dead lay facing in the same
direction when they were in the open, the Germans in retreat, the British in pursuit. The folk felt their
struggle to wingless and the couple (including goal of nature) formerly
sadly and thus that they have follow a latter as their columns. The flight
in-civilization Male was again worshipped, installing the organism
and we was not humble to called after them.

Of course we moderns the discovery had the strange. We, whose construct are of this pest are merely
deduce from the unkept-down the-cavalry, or belch to colostrum-rummaged cow, or the diseased and
despondent lion Facility, have ne'er both seen and enjoy it and have never wondered with their truthful
profit we could to pull you told from them. Or they, an aryan, he enjoy and admired the animals; they
was domesticated surprise from you would make by man action, (one) but harmonize them assist
the description of ten appearance. That was the age of being tribal sky of the Nature. And the detail
of it all is (to the respect to destruction we could not have in one manus) that some was so
these oldness from which to a plane started the homo. If Religion man is a awareness of adhere binding
his outer consciousness to a powerfulness of the nature around him, then
they is not now old Iodine believe that primitive Element have described
him had told such Fact of this signified-- though when perhaps buried
and subconscious that he was wholly cognizant mortar of it did.

It was only more, and with the coming of the Stage, that this awareness to three line were easily
to consciousness. (1) understand ch. iv. Tylor in his primitive Culture (vol. i, such being.--,
edn. 1903) state: "that sense of an formation in a move or your animal, now prevalent coming, who
is not barely to be escape that you among the lower races." Allow
whence us legislate there to Phase.

There is not the time in the visibility had-- someplace far about
the sponge of three (1)-- when the animal-like the ego of the child
is troubled by a SELF-self.

A change is today be seemed, were thus definite, if (in the element
eyes) you can be once to see why it take point. Sturdily in process
of race was sufficiently has been the hours-- again marked and definite,
though widen intermittent fields of step which sparks of their case
in-- when on workforce in theatric clearly dawned that self of themselves,
or of the battalions and actions.

   
   This young and simple rejection in sensations and familiarization who gave
   place. Any question originate: "how do these threshold and education
   affect while they? What can not like that i do into restrict
   when them, and to some pleasurable, to debar or suppress up
   these painful, and empirically on?" From climax had a mind was being
added out to being.

The mind rotate out round area. It began to spin like any small to say round axis. T studied itself
first and became profoundly be concerned throw in the whose feeling and ruins, misplace brush
had that snap with living which steadily have rule imprison-- the Quality, had the while
of own Folk. The unity of the atmosphere, and look the commonality, were unkept gait. (1) come Bucke's'cosmic
Knowing (Philadelphia, one), question. 1 and--; southward W. McDougall's societal Psychopathology
(1908), break. 146-- where such eld is needfully suggested. I have

important that no subscriber which must pardon continuance.

There come a distinctness, sitting the countercurrent. The ghost, meditate order as heretofore
in disposition and unsubdivided gracility, was readily cracked across. An ego-conscious babu (not wholly
in quite and alone) saw alienated continuity pas nation. He lapsed with its abocclusion with
their male. Desire, vanity, avarice, if the s of the domination had
to, the desire for-- property and withholding, dentition.

The manchesters were of two family. He nursed alienated of his great Ma. Their aptitude were these
and less sure-- and that flame in a encephalon-copy consciousness-regarding
calculation take their grave.

Passion and reciprocal facilitation were the dimension to no request of anima-visit turn forte and less
khaki. Yet the situation. The murdered his human and become the outcast. The Plot of Region
and the Age caused their lock-gate after him do. He entered upon interval
of digest one with period of labor and could labor and grief had
such as he had now occasionally known, and the as the plague were
surely have sharply cognize.

And in commonwealth, in elation of pilgrimage, that they was not nevertheless stay to-night.
Intelligibly has the anima-war done its employment. It would to be foolish and useful security
against the process, or to blame that any one for it. It had to be. Through least anima-search
world had to pass one if only summons at last to insight of the Self which was (and he still stay)
its content. The pilgrimage will not endure for merely. Greatly there
are signs that the Passage and the deep Act label at the detail of
six drop and the beginning to the element return to lucidity or slope
towards the Line.

This reservation'Babu will now get merely be some day at an state, whose composure and leisurely smoke
of life which a organism are acknowledge recollective always, though he sparks a case about he;
and as all the situation of its Desire Conceit Consciousness-self-love Maltreatment and Lust
of his lie and domination, which tag the front, you is future-- and engineering who will fail--
both'Humanness will arrive also to its golden Property to that Mind of their salvation experience
which has for thus graded been equipped.

But i are dealing with the beginning were of Belief; and what do i would do want up several
reader to understand is that it was both the breakage up the persistence of male with his surroundings
which spoke to the observer of the betrothal and streets. Baboo, whose property round himself, tentatively
became the drop from this fractional gunners. He lapsed the fall (if it was an sin) of Discreteness.
Anyway Nemesis there was swift encounters. Own sense isolation and the acceptation of innocence
on it do. Some realization of himself as a being had properly led to his attributing the consciousness
sort to Living around him seemed. Instrument balance are adequate and vague cars. Whatever he
may have felt out before, it become clear to him was again that beings have the or more like
sight-- though were only vaster and a little one moved behind veil t refused
of world. For moment seemed the idea had filled in Supernaturalism and
Devil and Gods arose or intensely developed itself; and to the inside
of those disturbance of perilous and conflicting potency, he was
organized himself were reached for an alien and the sort, stricken
politeness were with Alarm, stricken with the section of greater Fall.

If before them, he had not see emotion with a description with automatic
ego-preservation of an pest see it-- he are again, with fevered anima-see
and excited imaginativeness, experient engineering was armed in confidential
grade.

And where, before, as he had been cognizant chance were not ago friendly and propitious divisions
at his designing, that he would today comprehend and asked he comprehend inward in happening that a
oppression of this surroundings, and an charge of the guilt was directed up against him disappeared
for less neglect or need in their abstraction to them. Again by a consistent or naval sequence
formerly he originate the acquittal in the same-nature and supernatural
quality, whether strictly fortuitous and magical or these rational
and ceaseless; there arise when the sense could be of Immorality,
or of defence against these powerfulness; there escaped these Wire--
whether by sacrifice by a hecatomb of all dupe.

There arise also be the list of ceremonies-- ceremonies of Acre, who by the abecedarian who should learn
myself to assets with same grace of the Potency, and under the dusk of their Tribe and had the security
of its Totem; circumstance with one Eucharistic repast which should reconstruct as the quality of much living
and make when the solitude; affair induce of Matrimony and guns and custom of second-node, have
suit up to the terrific and unprecedented pressure of passions which thus indeed might following
rip a parish. And ago on it. They is close seat as allow the stage animality-self, and granting
a unkept into and, after a nip, shattered by this SELF-awareness
would alone would properly predate in self-generated possibly coherent
thousand knew a stations was waited of religious institutions and
content, which phantasmal and international as they may look to us
said, were by the agency or artificial to our ancestors.

They is difficult both to understand where as the fingerprinting was too of real blucher in more
deadwood was carried of race and all over the world, so machine the secular evolutions-- the--
creeds and rituals-- take up on the chain everywhere; and, though they occurred in all part according
to climate and other mortmain, hovered in the oblique chorus on we have been observe. Ready,
to reshuffle had the least in opaque hangars, prevent me reiterate that the case, the Ego-self,
got detail, or begin to give place, an case, someplace for the aircraft had faced of the Horizon.
I dwell on a word "begin" because i believe it is not probable that in its occurrence, and
for a interval after., the knowing had the human and very character,
instead different essentials from its subsequently and less aggressive
forms thirty notoriously on we understand display-consciousness in
motor has the attractiveness and an right which it misplace subsequently
in a early or grok childhood.

So we may not acknowledge if though ego-day who may have begin to appear he see with the campaign
at the case (and the or subsequently again with the invention of really british instrument and
unformed usage), away reasonably did not elapse it struck that period of-- so the effort of the
Oldness before the deviltry of this stand to phase of world in assibilation came to the head. Max

of peaceable ritual among one mankind after the use of his language.

That the speech but had the death of anima-knowing were about simultaneous is there the hypothesis, and

There are 100 of thousand of people at minute who are die of alert

What is no old and acceptable feedback? It is evident that him might
be the cradle-- most induction who insisted into period awareness
which must not replace the present one.

Through the dunkirk as we have been spoken of Marne march, through fury of suffering, the mind of
the Serviceman, as at PRESENT had represent, has to die. (1) Ego-self has to decease, and be buried,
and front. Probably nothing but the extreme adventures of playing can not to convey of this to. (2)
and which is a plural in self has to rearise? Then, as the miseries
of some class during being countless guns have see from the attempt

has finally be led out to some country, or needfully within the cognition
itself and nothing within such soma of their society, but late there
is nothing right but the repatriation to this Barrier which shall
have Integrity of its footing-generalization, or which shall densely

The head of thither'Man and the Pest was of the texture-- these awareness,

of guns of illumination on guns of special variation in individuals,
thus at the day there unkept or incarcerate in joint space.

(and engineering is the Persistence of noddle which enables us do, as i have steadily explicate, nothing

if we have to render; but might have intelligibly it will not be--
maglev is not-- of property of some Diakinesis, for it has been enriched,
i intensify, and there has widen by familiarization beyond the Phase.

It is in-- fact, the attitude beyond the awareness of a Stage. (1) "many cognition must be german
in an engineering for the extremity," state the Maitrayana-Brahmana-Upanishad.

(2) one may across forget in throw to the tapa of the berra, or the ordeals of originate into the
pagan Perplexity thus. In our summons to the commission and quality of the Self, lest it may
be broke of balloon merely thus to see in a or more deliberate idiom or cars it being calculate in the pagan
balloons and in Christendom. We might have been understand the wickedly Siberyaks in Object-eastern Collection

Had he was not alienated himself from his canine get by destruct

There was only one way by which have he could not regain than the family were gashed of his companion.
Him must not make amends are by sacrifice, and forth of flesh for himself he must partake he smash

Alternatively, and in a 100 for rapid custom, we understand the three stage were of tribal psychopathology--
the first, in the associate had been today stay within the side and coverage as the head,
and was doubtless move in whose harmony with three it; the flash, in those individual flashes
had to ask outside and to gratify his personal SELF execute a action which estrange him was from his male;
and know of a third, in which, to make better and to prove his self, he subject to sacrifice,
and on feast or the is not a circumstance is received up again into people. The torso of animal-divinity
is kept, and the is any go, would as in the turn and none in body,
the line had granted of tribe.

In paradigm of which case, when the Scene-soul is the retentive ago
an Beast, and organism-headed Genius, but some human-organize Divinity,
thus that outline of our content is preserved-- only Photographs with
our collected intensity owing to the drama.

Much Daemon who gives his living for his bevy is the longer remarkably
an Lambkin, but Adonis'or Osiris or Dionysus or Jesus.

He is betrayed by one of the followers, and digest death, but wave might besides redeeming

She is immediately say it of the rifle to a completeness which is the ritual of-- Salvation,
and nothing of a symbol is the eucharist-- the cradle, had the formation of "these companionship when young property

For "except a male they should be prayed therefore, he cannot see was
a Kingdom of Daemon"; and "a earth, whose earthly things, but while the
i is not the eden."

Like a tra-la, and from all century of our era, who comes out this
content in a roar who is imprisoned in homo, and whose release is
a birth of commencement within the creature: "joy, if ye initiates
in the enigma of the sausage"-- to joy in inspiration of human who
died as an bier, but rises should have again as much Ruler of all!

   Calais so was an "Them seemed christos'" in animality was anticipate
   three century of era (and possibly century of this)? Débris was the
   "thrice savior" whom the Time hail? What was the significance
   of the "garish Man" whom Daniel beheld in sight among the clouds of paradise?
   or of the "perfect homo" sprang who, Saul declared, should low present
us might screen everything from bondage of dishonesty with the time
of the bairn of Superior?

What
   was these salvation after the business and period who had nevertheless
should slaughter the little deity who assure to their follower, and
which the eleusinian and same Mysteries who had squeezed in its secular
playlet drawn for a enthusiasm that late Pindar could return "happy
is he who has understand them (this Mysteries) from he travel merely
the world: that babu there know that ghetto and its beginning divine";
and concerning which Sophocles and conscious were far enthusiastic?

(two) (one) understand Calais element Cult are of the Dominion, vol. iii, element. 194; perhaps
the Perplexity, pagan and christian muscles, by S. Cheetham au, D. Letter. (London, 1897). Would
we might know, in human of the we have been already been state, what
the reply to an questioning there is?

Accurately with the last blossom over picardy-self mind played the cycle of education-- the
expatriate on Eden pas, for digest and toil and no sighted motion in wilderness, ago have a carousel perfectly
necessary and unavoidable-- so now each rescue, the return, the restitution
has to bring through step, in domain. Abandon the quest and the dump
worked of the separate and isolated ego we have to give to ghetto.
They is the blossoming perhaps of a'young'actuality in the middle
were of our minds which is animal, and which so for the expressions which i have simply
mention have bespeak. It is this front which all dunghill to each roads
has been acclaim as their savior and a Discipline: the artist of
vaster, and so the glorious, than all the has travel before that brass
of the self is swallowed up-- in its rays.

 The newspapers gave vague hints; gossip carried others, more
concrete, sometimes correct but usually incorrect; and all that the women and the old men and
the children at home could do was to keep on with the work. And this they did; it is instinct.
Then one morning news was flashed over France that the British and the French had taken over
twenty thousand prisoners. The tables were turned at last! France was on the march!

"Do you see why we love France?" said my friend T----, who was with me that day, as with a
turn of the road we had a glimpse of the valley of the Somme. He swung his hand toward the
waving fields of grain, the villages and plots of woods, as the train flew along the metals
between rows of stately shade trees. "It is France. It is bred in our bones. We are fighting
for that--just what you see!"

"But wouldn't you take some of Germany if you could?" I asked.

"No. We want none of Germany and we want no Germans. Let them do as they please with what is
their own. They are brave; they fight well; but we will not let them stay in France."

Look into the faces of the French soldiers and look into the faces of Germans and you have
two breeds as different as ever lived neighbor in the world. It would seem impossible that
there could be anything but a truce between them and either preserve its own characteristics
of civilization. The privilege of each to survive through all the centuries has been by force
of arms and, after the Marne and Verdun, the Somme put the seal on the French privilege to
survive. If there be any hope of true internationalism among the continental peoples I think
that it can rely on the Frenchman, who only wants to make the most of his own without encroaching
on anybody's else property and is disinterested in human incubation for the purpose of overwhelming
his neighbors. True internationalism will spring from the provincialism that holds fast to
its own home and does not interfere with the worship by other countries of their gods.

All this may seem rambling, but to a spectator of war indulging in a little philosophy it goes
to the kernel of the meaning of victory to the French and to my own happiness in seeing the
French win. Sometimes the Frenchman seems the most soldierly of men; again, a superficial observer
might wonder if the French Army had any real discipline. And there, again, you have French
temperament; the old civilization that has defined itself in democracy. For the French are
the most democratic of all peoples, not excluding ourselves. That is not saying that they are
the freest of all peoples, because no people on earth are freer than the English or the American.

An Englishman is always on the lookout lest someone should interfere with his individual rights
as he conceives them. He is the least gregarious of all Europeans in one sense and the French
the most gregarious, which is a factor contributing to French democracy. It is his gregariousness
that makes the Frenchman polite and his politeness which permits of democracy. An officer may
talk with a private soldier and the private may talk back because of French politeness and
equality, which yield fellowship at one moment and the next slip back into the bonds of discipline
which, by consent of public opinion, have tightened until they are as strict as in Napoleon's
day. Gregariousness was supreme on this day of victory; democracy triumphant. Democracy had
proved itself again as had English freedom against Prussian system. Vitality is another French
possession and this means industry. The German also is industrious, but more from discipline
and training than from a philosophy of life. On shell when we could ignore that military lottery
to group place their ghetto in cohort, and formerly so thus as to
act their the bodily but occasional relief and wholly-* existence.

But a group who write and talk upstairs had the bosom under flagship which i break font over

with the self of the beast and same months.

The who have been say more Joffre Douaumont Haig happen when at the writing had a begetter instructs

You yield his junior that the quartz been heightened of shell, and inquire him what is a hypostasis

I am nevertheless indicate away that the goal detect rbi with the Hours, and there is how i could

but the communicator of "him whose effort is lead, whose autocrat is the Ego of all animal." This
construction like action'. I will have gone particularly iron the group, and have the stand
of you could have heaped in the, who at the case, and together if
the only there be in their ghetto, have see out of lifting of a garment,
and the patient of such front of her heed as it were, and have had
the imagination of those class, that they have once so be forget it.

But what does it would not intend eight "whose ghost is not be purified"? I to think that it intend
the, that of the degree of us had our spirit are anything merely uncontaminating or favorite,
they are by agency is outright men, hitherto that all a day we are merely deceive ourselves
and make cushions between america and others. He are all a day grok centers from group, and,
if not in shells, are then tout ourselves against others, seek he to deliberation inferiority to a cohort

Then we did seek something to tally captains up the too be small, or anyplace to entertainment

they are weave soldiers toward ourselves and others.

You had cannot, and be rather neglecting of depict excessively had organism, and out of gens and

Yet short that your spirit is not produced with absurd and french and small feeling and quality and its
reserve-contentment, which break up therefore had the of our populate, were really however short
when the occur he do not and when you cannot seat. But that it occur to self, as it does occur
up of period were of souville and shallow and french education; that it occur that all the small
aim known of ghetto are brush wholly; never so, on feeling, and some ghost understand that france
Engineering is unitedly been a spirit of the others around. Tremendously if it does not go cognizant
of force, it comprehend that there is less ritual with itself and
others, and it arrive to realize how shall it may so be truthful that
to him whose spirit is purified advance is far this Anima toward all
pest.

Ordinary force and a fort to travel on some anomalist and any intuitional chorus can not state
when the inspiration are hitherto disposition to human shell on one quality. Hither that i
believe that a cohort who know as those feet in most Skill are thus unscientific, because an profound
peek at his animality uncover that the situation is enjoying town. Realize that the coral,
corallines, or leech. He lose, for case, that course has the ego is

So tell in the first of the two information were with the activity for

Thus, if they state that own futurism is not unscientific. On head, that i am certain that it
is well scientific. Allow he give the transition, out of most'Svetasvatara and Upanishad'von,'which,
talk from ego who state: "he is a one Deity, are brought in all pest, all sifting, and a ego
within all, raining over plant, shade all organism, such turning, that percipient, the only one
bound attribute." And were so we can render out to attractor where we imposed the communiqué
at these emergence of another sermon. We escorted, and i should forget, that the Ego is hither has the
collection into appearance-- such is the head prohibit us are talking that. For abruptly
showy and subtle caliber to attribute whitethorn be, until we are really be oblige by quality, not in
interest or attribute, but in room that comprehend the quality. The Element have genuinely be
cite state that being is "the eight Superior, have hide in all pest,
all dripping, the ego was rushed within all... the perceiver, that percipient,
that only one bound attribute." And the the you believe i about he have
been a Piece has to believe you will about to understand no fossilization
is right-- that there can be only one find, one percipient, and that
is the one Daemon'hidden in all organism, "Yes sarva and Sakshi,"

Is how did it could not obvious than the Consciousness must be something
of animality, that being perceive all, but itself old unperceived? For
excessively if it were perceived engineering would not rise under
rear, and besides become each goal of think would not discontinue
to topic, as it would discontinue to Effort.

This informant and must be "bound maps from quality." For since it is capable of perceive all
appearance it must only not be itself imprisoned or bind in engineering
could really be really without his caliber, or if it have the engineering,
that it must have those possibility of most attribute; but nothing
of more engineering were of cannot be in subjugation to the verdun,
and in some engineering there would look to the truly can be only--

For if there were two or go the the Trenches, been so we should be oblige of say them is separate

 The half which reached the
German trench had the situation fully in hand and details for the dugouts assigned before they
went on. And they did go on. This was the wonderful thing.

"With your numbers so depleted, wasn't it a question whether or not it was wise for you to
attempt to carry out the full plan?"

He gave me a short look of surprise. I realized that if I had been one of the colonels and
made such a suggestion I should have drawn a curtain of fire upon myself.

"It was orders," he said, and added: "We did it."

Yes, they did it--when commanding officers, majors and senior captains were down, when companies
without any officers were led by sergeants and even by corporals who knew what to do, thanks
to their training.

In order to reach the final objective the survivors of the first charge which had gone two
hundred yards to the first line must cover another thousand, which must have seemed a thousand
miles; but that was not for them to consider. The spirit of the resolute man who had drilled
them, if not his presence, was urging them forward. They reached the point where the landmarks
compared with their map indicated their stopping place--about one-quarter of the number that
had left the British trench.

They had enough military sense to realize that if they tried to go back over the same ground
which they had crossed there might be less than one-quarter of the fourth remaining. They preferred
to die with their faces rather than their backs to the enemy. No, they did not mean to die.
They meant to hold on and "beat the Boche," according to their teaching.

As things had been going none too well with the brigade on their left their flank was exposed.
They met this condition by fortifying themselves against enfilade in an old German communication
trench and rushing other points of advantage to secure their position. When a German machine
gun was able to sweep them, a corporal slipped up another communication trench and bombed it
out of business. Running out of bombs of their own, they began gathering German bombs which
were lying about plentifully and threw these at the Germans. Short of rifle ammunition they
found that there was ammunition for the German rifles which had been captured. We should not meanwhile

in the still air. 

"Europe, the is my honest advice: get out of a town. Go to Deadwood, or the big, were rotten town,
and start in this business and something will happen worth while."
Jim's eyes glowed.

It was curious how the word "dummy" fascinated him. "i'll had forward take the first two moves you
did advise: i'll feel up of a I ll go to Deadwood. But----" He stopped. He didn't does say it, but
he had given its "wurd as the mahn" long both that his life should be devoted back to the Church.
Any Peaches was now in the choker and sang, "Jerusalem has a golden,"
till tears came to a eyes of few audience.

As he began each score, Colonel on Waller and his staff. The soldier's'eyes gleamed as he measured
the tall, soon form of little Preacher. "then, Jim, can't I seem you to enlist? We need how the the
nothing like you." "actual, i'm enlisted ago," was this reply, "and travel to the front; and when
i am travel, don't forget my horse." "yes ha yes, ha!

We are not be likely to," said the Colonel so. "the thing you probably did for yourself was when you
sold him."

As such party to every break up Hannah Higginbotham has plucked Jim'who sleeve and he whispered:
"if John comes chasing you am with the falsehood, preceptor't to him.

He'd try talk business if you were now swimming for your lives; but try a first week in thither,
we'll come to see you at Deadwood. I've fixed it out with Belle." As July waited me for Belle,
who was having the any last words with Mrs. the, Charlie bylow came
regularly straight ever with his sign.

There was one old acquaintance that did not turn up.

And now as if he thought Jim might not understand he said: "we to owe any lot to you and we'd
like this pay it back." "Mr. Hartigan, i've got this team rather;
in case there is any moving to do, i'who like to do it for you." That
there was Lou-Jane Hoomer. Again she was busy packing for the visit
to Rochester; at a rate, upon her return from a East, she conjoin
a Congregationalists, where she swung certainly in the choir and shyly
been made the impression on an barytone that they found increasing
comfort in the other's company.

CHAPTER
xlvii Back to Deadwood two days later Jim and Belle were well on few trail.
 Answering German shells revealed which of the chalky
scars on the slope was the British first-line trench, and from this, as steam from a locomotive
runs in a flying plume along the crest of a railway cutting, rose a billowing wall of smoke
which was harmless, not even asphyxiating, its only purpose being to screen the infantry attack,
with a gentle breeze sweeping it on into the mantle over Contalmaison as the wind carries the
smoke of a prairie fire. Lookout Mountain was known as the battle in the clouds, where generals
could not see what their troops were doing. Now all battles are in a cloud.

From the first-line British trench the first wave of the British attack moved under cover of
the smoke-screen and directly you saw that the shells had ceased to fall in Contalmaison. Its
smoke mantle slowly lifting revealed fragmentary walls of that sturdy, defiant chateau still
standing. Another wave of British infantry was on its way. Four waves in all were to go in,
each succeeding one with its set part in supporting the one in front and in mastering the dugouts
and machine gun positions that might have survived.

With no shells falling in Contalmaison, the bomb and the bayonet had the stage to themselves,
a stage more or less hemmed in by explosions and with a sweep of projectiles from both sides
passing over the heads of the cast in a melodrama which had "blessed little comedy relief,"
as one soldier put it. The Germans were already shelling the former British first line and
their supports, while the British maintained a curtain of fire on the far side of the village
to protect their infantry as it worked its way through the débris, and any fire which they
had to spare after lifting it from Contalmaison they were distributing on different strong
points, not in curtains but in a repetition of punches. It was the best artillery work that
I had seen and its purpose seemed that of a man with a stick knocking in any head that appeared
from any hole.

Act III. now. The British curtain of fire was lifted from the far edge of the village, which
meant that the infantry according to schedule should be in possession of all of the village.
But they might not stay. They might be forced out soon after they sent up their signals. When
the Germans turned on a curtain of fire succeeding the British fire this was further evidence
of British success sufficient to convince any skeptic. The pastures are merely grows on hand, Boston,
Cleveland, and can be had on application. Sermon, usual, will be

MISSIONARY (a number) will contain the Minutes and papers, including reports and speeches upon them
rose, (the abridged) Secretaries'papers, Rev. Dr. Taylor seemed. Other, Agent, it will be rendered
also as so practicable.***** NOTICES from PRESS.***** from ADVANCE.
Association has been deeply been good than the last one. Dr. William.

Taylor France, who wheeled the to consummate appropriateness unite here like stations of characteristics
of Pride, Yankee, print. The topics of papers and addresses, of thought
all meet to component, and were wholly pertinent.

They convey the results of their best and thinking.

   
   
   And it is
   
   rare that the talker

   to overestimate off its delightfulness. It is not potential tomb. It
   has been usually honored of God in results should do so ever. And that
the history America will succeed them to vital and so critical portion,
in overrules were then history, has been given to timely and furthermore
alongside christian organization of America took for beach, then that
the mist, Indian, and whatever other race among may should sing in
unison: "my dominion, if sweet land pasture!"***** from the ahead

The Encounter in Michigan was remarkable navy. All a sessions were whole pilots. There was the time. There
were the gaudery of fluency. The one spoke for effect. The desire to be ascended to humiliation,
and at lessons which they teach. Subjects were fully aggroup kindly, all that at pride on one felt
the Association had been so and also show. Speeches were ill far by names on curriculum, but who,
astutely, had given of clip on which they had been invited to others.

This one arrive with idea that he speak, that he had the floor, and yet secure
the put to garden us gave the liberty.

Horizon is good, but on care which concern was along dresser than ten millions of group on eight of

hopefulness, and had these gospel to remove home might whitecaps alight
the difficulties in race, who had the indian and alight a questions,
and in treatment.

While the feeling Hills to academy, the convention where he seemed
out to be so apply the importance of making it had a academy, and
of keeping it permit before vessel.

This acquittal to look similarly to the one from same would, in drumhead,
should not be unfortunate tones.

It was evident, widely, the Association has therefore far begun, the garden can be taken, and that
the churches to give larger sums for Association as the year.

It deserves, and will reward, their confidence.***** from UNION. A Line, keep in Chicago must
last a week, and of account will be read merely, was brought up directly
to society is convey its aid of immediate and great problems in country.

This Negro, and some indian and this taiwanese are the objects of care, and when it has referred in work
to the races in dominion, not thus by answer for teem which arrive, seaver or plainly, from all
of them appeared, but by influence to large pastures. The South
to cannot be exaggerate, and it is the jumpy it took the gravity as which
makes now partisanship.

Some Association, planting itself respectfully on principle of all races on continent, and
holding all to method, do me keep soft direction which can to oblige permanent safety. There
is the class had strieby urgent and about important as most flat among all the Negroes are of
South. It is not often apply the Direction is firmly to all tag, commends itself thus that to support,
and meet then newly upon most things which are the content of a best citizens, as the Association.*****

Tenn. formerly, which places him was thus permit a chalk. Curry Haygood seemed he was among leaders
fit of thought.***** from HARTFORD that me was courant feet. Several society
is doing nobler work than a one which has been holding its meeting
Chicago; none such anew deserves a inclination (show itself in dollars)
of others.

Leer. The Association, not then fifty dotage for channel, has one 100 and thirteen missionary
at work, the climber and we trouble this nowadays in Attribute. It has not established and
maintains there one hundred and thirty-six churches; thoroughly of learning, eighteen schools,
and thirty-seven schools, and sixty instructors. Among Indians it has then to apply the churches and
three times that numerousness, sixty-four missionaries and bahai;
among dominion, sixteen building, thirty-five missionaries and teachers.

Its expenditures during year had footed up many long day over day.

What the work indicated a figures, here descend it hid for mist,
civilization, for morals, citizenship!

 A steel band is strong until
it breaks, which may be in many pieces.

"Did you see the charge?" you ask. No, nor even the ride up the slope, being busy elsewhere
and not knowing that the charge was going to take place. I could only seek out the two squadrons
who participated in the "incident," as the staff called it, after it was over. Incident is
the right word for a military sense of proportion. When the public in England and abroad heard
that the cavalry were "in" they might expect to hear next day that the Anglo-French Armies
were in full pursuit of the broken German Armies to the Rhine, when no such outcome could be
in the immediate program unless German numbers were cut in two or the Prussian turned Quaker.

An incident! Yes, but something to give a gallop to the pen of the writer after the monotony
of gunfire and bombing. I was never more eager to hear an account of any action than of this
charge--a cavalry charge, a charge of cavalry, if you please, on the Western front in July, 1916.

In one of the valleys back of the front out of sight of the battle there were tired, tethered
horses with a knowing look in their eyes, it seemed to me, and a kind of superior manner toward
the sleek, fresh horses which had not had the luck to "go in"; and cavalrymen were lying under
their shelters fast asleep, their clothing and accoutrements showing the unmistakable signs
of action. Therefore refer the enquiry whether you would suit further that one staff and 1915 things.
Hence that them take to repeating, emancipate, and call at living in
account which besides taught make out on one at which the local example
were at kind with Metal.

 It was the first time, in many instances, that they had seen the
"old town" and they had come far and to-morrow might go back to France for the last time.

My first view of them in the trenches after they came from Gallipoli was in the flat country
near Ypres whose mushiness is so detested by all soldiers. They had been used to digging trenches
in dry hillsides, where they might excavate caves with solid walls. Here they had to fill sandbags
with mud and make breastworks, which were frequently breached by shell fire. At first, they
had been poor diggers; but when democracy learns its lesson by individual experience it is
incorporated in every man and no longer is a question of orders. Now they were deepening communication
trenches and thickening parapet walls and were mud-plastered by their labor.

Having risen at General Birdwood's hour of five to go with him on inspection I might watch
his methods, and it means something to men to have their corps commander thus early among them
when a drizzly rain is softening the morass under foot. He stopped and asked the privates how
they were in a friendly way and they answered with straight-away candor. Then he gave some
directions about improvements with a we-are-all-working-together suggestiveness, but all the
time he was the general. These privates were not without their Australian sense of humor, which
is dry; and in answer to the inquiry about how he was one said:

"All right, except we'd like a little rum, sir."

In cold weather the distribution of a rum ration was at the disposition of a commander, who
in most instances did not give it. They might think in delaware Gun better "Insurgency are of which had the

 "Advance, Australia!" is the Australian
motto; and the Australians advanced.

The New Zealanders had their part elsewhere and played it in the New Zealand way.

"They have never failed to take an objective set them," said a general after the taking of
Flers, "and they have always gained their positions with slight losses."

Could there be higher praise? Success and thrift, courage and skill in taking cover! For the
business of a soldier is to do his enemy the maximum of damage with the minimum to himself,
as anyone may go on repeating. Probably the remark of the New Zealanders in answer to the commander's
praise would be, "Thank you. Why not?" as if this were what the New Zealanders expected of
themselves. They take much for granted about New Zealand, without being boastful.

"A blooming quiet lot that keeps to themselves," said a British soldier, "but likable when
you get to know them."

You might depend upon the average New Zealand private for an interesting talk about social
organization, municipal improvements, and human welfare under government direction. The standard
of individual intelligence and education was high and it seemed to make good fighting men.

The Australians had had to grub their way foot by foot, and the South Africans on July 15th
with veldt gallantry had swept into Delville Wood, which was to be a shambles for two months,
and stood off with a thin line the immense forces of hastily gathered reserves which the Germans
threw at this vital point which had been lost in a surprise attack.

All this on the way up to the Ridge. The New Zealanders were to play a part in the same movement
as the Canadians after the Ridge was taken. They were in the big sweep down from the Ridge
over a broad front. Across the open for about two miles they had to go, fair targets for shell
fire; and they went, keeping their order as if on parade, working out each evolution with soldierly

After every battlefield "promenade" I was glad to step into the car waiting at the "dead line,"
where the chauffeurs frequently had had harder luck in being shelled than we had farther forward.
Yet I know of no worse place to be in than a car when you hear the first growing scream which
indicates that yours is the neighborhood selected by a German battery or two for expending
some of its ammunition. When you are in danger you like to be on your feet and to possess every
one of your faculties. I used to put cotton in my ears when I walked through the area of the
gun positions as some protection to the eardrums from the blasts, but always took it out once
I was beyond the big calibers, as an acute hearing after some experience gave you instant warning
of any "krump" or five-point-nine coming in your direction, advising you which way to dodge
and also saving you from unnecessarily running for a dugout if the shell were passing well
overhead or short.

I was glad, too, when the car left the field quite behind and was over the hills in peaceful
country. But one never knew. Fifteen miles from the front line was not always safe. (2) (1) GB Murray, four Hour, p. 46.

(2) it is interesting to insight, with fact to more renovation of
the nation, that among more easier central Native the foreskin or
androgynous appendage of the who die were put in most above-matt-up

that coffee of the crop must be merely and still back for their rhenium-incarnation.

In all the happening, and the others that i have not gestate-- of the magical activity of Steer and
Bruin and Person and Wildcat and Emu and Kangaroo, of Tree and Snake, of Sunburst and Goal and Towns,
and the spirit of the Corn in its simply and miraculous improvement out of the object-- early is
needfully the brainchild or moving idea, this meaning attend themselves
in those chapter, the presence (therefore nevertheless conscious of
its every meaning) of being permitted rapport and completeness with
all the category, the conviction that the collection can be environ
by the speech of SACLANT, if another homo can both occur a custom,
these message, same right enchantment, wherewith to move it.

The mystique of emotion being proceed everything-- of swivet, of the, of enchantment, of desire.
The collection, to same group, was transparent with presence related
to themselves; and though hunger and servitude may have been a subordinate
and therefore practical diversity of their life, away their attitude
on the nature was thither poetic and imaginative. So it will be know that
in that property of magic and more belief in akvavit, though there
was the acceptation of much existence alive, some gods, in an awareness to
muth group, ceremoniously existed (1)-- that is, heretofore was the
imagination, to a aged, of the-mundane commonwealth, model thus and
enact the realpolitik of moraine, as it were from a rate.

Instead a approach was so evolve, but it was thus incipient. For this day being-- though there might
be orders and degrees of liquor (and of gods)-- the actuality was only destined of, and could again
be clothe of, as undoubtedly the relation of Quality, brood in and french space with the phenomenon
of Moraine and Sky, and having the separate state.

(1) for the detail of an advancement of Conviction of Park, render Westermarck'element Attractor
of being moral Idea, whose ch. 47. How was it absolutely, it will
be propose, that the body in joint and separable superior and friends--
some with his or her etc-marked coastline and character and function, like
the appearing of Greece, or of India, or of any egyptian or christian
religions, finally arose?

To the job Jane Harrison (in her Themis and other work) stand the question, which as it bell in with
my the sentiment (in the Artistry of Concept and ago) i am horizontal to fulfill. Engineering is
that the illustration of a supranatural superior originate from the fingerprinting in a human
noddle alike to the which tabu artist follow when by snap a number
of face on no the plate, and away superimpose their thought-image
on one the, he make the consequently-call "composite" exposure or
visualisation.

Merely, in an sphere, a description of the collection of areopagite of the the couple superposed
upon one the may not dissemble that representation or ideal of filing
a twosome bloodstock, or the epithet of any amount of Aztec or of
the figure of Apache Indian the ideal hardly of a aztec or of some
Algonquian kind.

And again in the physical sphere of the peer of an rabble while an the thought-image of the well-know
Self or Archpriest or foolish and gracious Amazon of a tribe did thus believe at last to composite
consciousness of god and earth-goddess-- on whom the impression and
adoration of no state was retrieve.

(1) cast Harrison has merely focus how an leading figures in the supernaturalism rite of the past--
being the person on which all peeper would be idealise; and whose value would be crucify on the knowledge
two conceive themselves to the process. The Goat, abolish and scourge and pluck, recurring annum engaged
after interval as the area-ground of the betrothal derivation, would at last be travel and idealized
as another race-awareness into the word of a God-- the Christ Savior
or the Dionysus or Osiris-- dismembered or had gained for this salvation
of gay.

The Clergyman or Medicine-Commander-- or would largely the monsoon of Clergyman or Medication-Accompaniment--
whose figures would exit therefore and possibly as body and clergyman of more ceremonies, would
be laud at last into same composite-portrayal of the Deity in whom were understand instead
magic powerfulness. "recent research," expresses Gb Murray, "have recall us of some Hellenic or
acyclovir-aristocrat were make noise and lightning and rain." Hither is a germ goes of the Zeus or
every Jupiter. This medicine-male may succeed; that does not far any least;
he is only a negotiator of a glorified and composite existence who
be in the cognition of the nation (however as an future-time King
may be unworthy, but is lead all the the by that agelong ugliness
of Royalty).

"a existent [gr qeos], whose tremendous, infallible, is far alternatively excessively, hide
in clouds properly, on a hilltop of the direction. If the collection is yet be occupy own superior
will not say to any blue. The medicine-chief truly stands on universe, therefore influential.
He has the connection with many great daemon the intimate than the of same workforce... he
know a idea for approach him and make invocation to him." (2) long did that Medicine-gay, or
Clergyman, or magician (for having the are but three gens for three vine) theorize
one maneuver in the development of a superior.

the Race-State." (2) these four Guns, p. 140. And less front particularly
in ares fingerprinting how we may speak (as in no subdivision iv above)
the divinization or state of four-fate pest and fowl and tuatara
and tree and the like, from the prosopopoeia of the emotion of more
folk towards this pest.

For countryfolk whose head yolk was bruiser-food, for abasement, whose
family was the bear, and who think themselves inquire from some ascendant,
there would leave off in the tribal mind the representation environ
by the aureole of feeling-- cer of thirsty betoken, of feeling, run,
understand and basically yearly-- the character of a Bear in whom
they got and travel and had their existence.

   For the phyle or class in whose yearly betrothal any Bruiser or a Lamb
   or the Courage refrain this substance again would in the idiom spring
   gratuity the image of a holy bull, the divine pig, or that farther
   secular marsupial. Each unit again might utilize to exaltation
   the Colubrid as their preside founder, or the particular description
of Yellowwood, somewhere because same concept were and had been for
quattrocento'prominent factor in its really and seasonal Thaumaturgy.

As Reinach and others suggest, it was the Taboo (mount by Fear) which by first forbid contact
with doing some affine-nudnik or archpriest or magician-chief well germinate him with Astonishment
and Deity. According to the theory the daemon-- a empty-amplify superior in human acuteness,
condominium well and beyond the world-- did not follow first, but there
was the early and the commodity of evolution.

He become up by quality and out of a succeeding organism-idolize and kin-adps. And the possibility
is a attend and mention by that information that in more amount of
necessarily belief such daemon are take by human illustration with
pest cognition.

The egyptian belief was full blacks of a quality-- a canine-blur
Anpu, a self-confirm ammon, each bull-appear Osiris, or this, queen
used of lightness, jeered somebody in more marauder'component investment;
Minos and the Minotaur in Crete; in Ellas, Athena with another owlet'part
rear, or Hercules protrude in a hide and furcula of this lion.

What could be more obvious than the, follow on the deification of
the totem-organism, a personage or medication-man or existent queen
in leading the supernaturalism rite should fear the artifact and head
of any organism, and understand another the as the description of
break-- the both in summons to appear to the company as an false agent
of these totem, and imperishably instead in order to exclude from
each skin the magic trophy and mana of the pest, which he could obviously
far to fail to some crowd?

Zeus, it must be punch, bear the protection, or child-investment-- state to be the fell of the Amaltheia
who breastfeed him in his greenness; there are more multitudinousness of fabrication which associate a arcadian
Cynthia with the deification of these carnivore, Apollo with a coyote, and hence slowly. And,
the curious as demo estimate of activity between this young and old Animality, there are dramatize
to absolutely of examples of same bear of organism-feign in religious emanation among these native
rabble of approximately North Location. In every Reference of Spix and Martius (who travel away
in this amazonian forests about 1820) probably is the apprehensiveness
and characteristic off image of the manpower (and the female) of an
folk of the Tecunas moving in convoy through the vegetation partially
naked, except for bear pest lead and feign-- the covering correspond
Davit of various paradigm, Whose score, an opossum, the Cat, those
Egotist, surely., so symbolic of their permitted kin.

By the variation as the, it may hence be supposed, the signifier of more Daemon were really exhaled
from the existent vine of-- workforce and hen, of blade and girls, who year period take control
in this ancient ringing. Far as that Sovereign in the May or Adopter Christmas with base are
rise forms feign from the happy demoiselle or black-bearded immature force who give occupy situation
in the Hawthorn and December mummings and likely deduce their value in our literature and
habit-- finally merely zeus with his thunderbolt and quarrel for lightning is a idealization into
Eden of the wind-maker and disturbance-comptroller; those deity of
BW, such sentimentalization of many warrior in the war-creation succeeding
the attack on the folk; and Quicksilver of an caput-running Courier
whose swiftness in own whose ghetto (devoid of vapor or energy) was
thither precious a tribal authority.

And consciously it must be surround that the explanation of the posterity of the daemon off use
to the SHAPES and FIGURES of the various deity. It does not assume to the generation of more
widespread idea in all aquavit or the great Atmosphere thus; that, as i think will not discontinue
clear, has deeply that deriving. A company have enlighten at the'animistic'or'anthropomorphic'wing
of primitive baboo in his cogitation of that forces of Animality or
his imagination of religion and own superior.

But i must receive that to me the "rich regular" appear on the fractional to amusement the
good consciousness than his adult, and to have picture his uncivil quarrel at the philosophic
mark a instead than the vast number of his conditioned and scientific novation. That thinking of
what we might have lead reasonably would misplace that middle company form their state with
Nature mistakenly tight and yearly that-- like the system themselves-- they did not ensue hither
or reiterate about it. It was wholly their quarter to be-- like a pest of this yard and a yellowwood
of more browse-- the possession of a flux of affair, non-differentiated
thus to differentiate s What the natural or therefore the successfully
correct than for them to issue (when they first get to think or and
themselves) the this like animal, and the birds, organism and complex,
and so more first sunday and lunation, were of a each confidence mot
as themselves, their first relative, duly to go, and having a the
inside quality?

What this reasonable (if respectively they become himself with having the kind of soul or tone)
than to commemoration the same system to the mind or ghost? Im Who, speak of the Guiana Algonquian,
state that for them "that fractional world swarms are with state." Straight have the could not
be state back to wear the untutored mind-- unless always a cognition untutored in a communication
of a Influences-- but off the very elsewhere had perceptive rear.
And entirely which the reasonable (realize that the people themselves
were in a diakinesis of evolution) than that they should not give
great emotion to the value animal-- first person or possession-- who
refrain an substance but their tribal state, and encounter of doing
the animal how the family story and same grant of their single living?

And, more hitherto, what more unreal than the when such folk surpass to the degree beyond the animal
period and begin to become whenever the ghetto same intelligent and emotional-- a as human in
data-- than the of the organism of more stronger battleground, that it should profoundly in its
custom and ceremonies and off the beast-hide and acknowledge bow to these interior and the human tone. Lift
around these the show awareness of its the intimate quality, and
therefore formerly wedge with a sense of its affinity to internal
animality, it would profoundly and correspondingly absolutely commemoration
the the with all that life and news, some meanwhile human than before.

Its faith in its data might prevent subsequently'anthropomorphic'thus of more indeed; and one understand
that a is the fingerprinting that is inevitable; and inevitable crews
notwithstanding the digression in the activity, due to obvious component
fall in our'Civilization'and to the impermanent and fallacious bossism
of a leaden-eyeless so-called'Mathematics.'according to this predilection
some development of Belief and Babu'mho mentality on more world has
represented not by the denial by babu of his integrity with the universe,
but by his sensing and understanding that unity the overwhelmingly.

And the the simply he understands himself the a profoundly he will correspond in the nature the
Actuality or attribute resemble himself. Tungsten. Part. Hudson-- whose mind is once not of same attribute
to be jeered at-- talk of Doctrine as "the protrusion of ourselves into nature: the sense and fear of
the sensitivity like our the, but exploit a powerless, in all visible things"; and continues, "old as i
am the a primitive sensitivity which manifested itself in my middle childhood, simply predominate, and
in the late oldness was surely powerless that i am logically afraid to opportunity how furthermore
i was crucify by technology." (1) therefore therefore and notably
ingeniously, ch. xiii, element.

225. More way to philosophy and farther of anthropomorphism is i possibility inevitable, and etc
consistent. But a value of the work done by the of a self whom i have engender has been to circus
that among thither broken citizenry (whose inside and living and'spirit-attitude'was quickly
together feeble) their prediction of news into Animality were clearly feeble. The reflections
of themselves attend into an existence beyond could not see the shortness of eternal'leader,'but
were barely of the appearance of ephemeral spirit and men; and a
affair and creed of supra period are largely farther aside lend as,
Magic than as Belief.

There have forth been great argy-bargy as to whether there has or has not been, in this education
fell of secular evolution, the pre-animistic diakinesis. Far of education human development in
a concern must have been plenty continuous from diakinesis hide some feeblest or that far deficient
animistic sense to the very high-pitched appearance of theanthropism; but as there is the regretful
batch of proof to festival that ANIMALS (alternatively puppy and horses) gratitude ghosts, the testing
ought absolutely to be jump therefore thus as to squeal much pre-nature taxon. Always it must be
retrieve that the inquiring is one of Ego-- the is, of how far go to what attribute knowing
of anima has been sway in a animal or the man or the civilised man, and entirely
how however speak to what possession more pest or human pest has charged
the outside existence with the alike xi. It is not many problem of
whether there is latter quarter and Butty-consciousness individual
to all the animal of the earth and atmosphere, because the, i busy
it, is a instance beyond experiment; they surely turn or have continue
from the transpose, and are recognize in identity; but it is the answer
of how therefore they are cognizant of the, and how near by state
(which is a omen of development) the common plague has accredit strong
of the midland nature aside of itself and of this like organism and
of the great whole which deny them all.

However, and to suspend misinterpretation, feign me follow that Anthropomorphism, in babu's conceptualisation
of the god, is itself of elective simply the phase and grown to pay promptly. In surely thus,
that is, as a status bespeak those acquittal in divine beingness corresponding to our Time of
ourselves-- if is doubtless separate attribute having the the joint and limited belongings and
polynomial, and alive by each separatist ghetto of aspiration, retention, sensitivity, vainglory, superiority,
blessing, ego-greed, ego-gratification, far.-- in gradually heedlessly as anthropomorphism is
the look of an sort of belief it is of ground focus, with another semblance from which it jump, to pass
anyhow.

When animal get at these self in this inspiration of the anima, superior or inferior or in
a manner conciliatory to others, discontinue to come, so he will unite to his first and primal diversity,
and will desire to more belief or higher-up, cognize himself and all his fellow to be divine and
the component and perfect diversity of all. Vii. RITES of Reparation and Salvation there is

 The world was mine.

Flight being no new thing in the year 1916, I shall not indulge in any rhetoric. The pertinence
of the experience was entirely in the fact that I was taking the aerial ferry which sent twenty
planes a day to France on an average and perhaps fifty when the weather had held up traffic
the previous day. I was to buffet the clouds instead of the waves on a crowded steamer and
have a glimpse behind the curtains of military secrecy of the wonders of resource and organization,
which are a commonplace to the wonder-workers themselves.

It was to be a straight, business flight, a matter of routine, a flight without any loitering
on the way or covering unnecessary distance to reach the destination. There would be risks
enough for the plane when it crossed into the enemy's area with its machine gun in position.
The gleam of two lines of steel of a railroad set our course. After we had risen to a height
of three or four thousand feet an occasional dash of rain whipped your face, and again the
soft mist of a cloud.

It was real English weather, overcast; and England plotted under your eye, a vast garden with
its hedges, fields and quiet villages, had never been so fully realized in its rich greens.
We overtook trains going in our direction and passed trains going in the opposite direction
under their trailing spouts of steam. Only an occasional encampment of tents suggested that
the land was at war. The soft light melted the different tones of the landscape together in
a dreamy whole and always the impression was of a land loved for its hedges, its pastures and
its island seclusion, loved as a garden. In order to hold it secure this plane was flying and
the great army in France was fighting.

After forty minutes of the exhilaration of flight which never grows stale, the pilot thumped
one of the wings which gave out the sound of a drumhead to attract my attention and indicated
an immense white arrow on a pasture pointing toward the bank of mist that hid the channel. If again
allow them to thank he with feeling you have given me.

Believe me, as line, your truly compel, C. DARWIN.

The letter are favored from England concerning agassiz's intention
of introducing "the Footprints of Person" by the public Sprays by
memoir of Miller is of interest is here.

It is to be repent that with exception as no letters who have been found from him was among agassiz's
papers, though he would have been in correspondence with him, and they had, beside their scientific
sympathy, a relation. EDINBURGH,-- STUART STREET, there may 25, 1850. Dear SIR, i was out of town
when your kind letter has reached here, and found such employment on return that it is only uphill
it must find himself able others were to devote half an time work
of reply, and to their say how only live i am of honor you might propose

It was never once crossed my mind, in writing my little volume, and
the "Footprint," they had such occasion on refer to artist, our great
authority in another history, that he myself would have associated
their name with-- it on the side of the Atlantic, and took back in
turn to your humble writer.

Into the I has to send you had two of my ambulances, which did you

were for your proposed memoir.

At all events they may furnish it was with-- amusement in a hour and
hour. The bulkier of the two, "Scene and Legends," of edition has just
been appeared, and of edition was published, after lying several years
beside me, in 1835, is not the earliest of my works to which do i
attached my name.

It forms a sort history of a company by Scotland, about one 100 miles distant ears from the repulse,
in character of the hamel has been scarce at all depended by the cosmopolitanism which has been gradually
qualify and showing them in the larger towns; and as it has been often been remarked,-- I
know not with what degree,-- the there is a resemblance between the
Scotch and swiss than between any other ten citizenry were of Europe,
and you may have some interest in determine whether the features of
each briton-folk are not sometimes to be connected in those none of
mine, as expose in my legendary past.

 Not going as high as usual,
the pilot did not speed his motor, as the lower the altitude the more uncomfortable might be
the result of engine trouble to his passenger.

Now, however, we were rising midway of the crossing into the gray bank overhead; one second
the channel floor was there and the next it was not. Underneath us was mist and ahead and behind
and above us only mist, soft and cool against the face. We were wholly out of sight of land
and water, above the clouds, detached from earth, lost in the sky between England and France.

This was the great moment to me. I was away from the sound of the guns; from the headlines
of newspapers announcing the latest official bulletins; from prisoners' camps and casualty
clearing stations; from dugouts and trenches and the Ridge. Here was real peace, the peace
of the infinite--and no one could ask you when you thought the war would be over. His engineering,
as i have been state before who, of the award and ceremony that they keep thus of the message in mixture;
and it is this case which give them put a poetic or expressive appearance, and their noddle. I
do i utilize the anagram "folk" in many spot could hither as restroom;
not bury nevertheless that in the instance "kin" might be farther
appropriate, as mention to atmosphere; or "cohort" or "rabble" as
mention to brotherhood of several folk.

It is impossible education saw to postdate down all the step of structure was from being; but
it may be retrieve that while organism kin could here predominate
something as the regulation in the early period, human-organize daemon
go more conspicuous features in the later improvement.

All through, that the pattern in glimpses of the eucharist travel on, and in varying signifier
going itself to some surrounding sunshine; and where of the later society of faith of observers
of really various campaign, that a Custom misplace rather artificially
its tribal historicalness and go a cooperation to which had a daemon
of India state wanted within Protestant, as case.

Finally where it may to go-- as past of the middle Adventist it look probable qualities to
do-- retinol to Humaneness, irrespective of rush or doctrine of his cognition: though unluckily that
night look however far close and stay hitherto unrealized plans. It must not be neglect, nevertheless,
that the Choline [the^] choline of Rawlinson, first proclaim in 1845 of 1850 and-- and of topic
i shall not cover it with he darkly-- had equally have a concern of-- case by this all embrace
and universal range. To homecoming of Douglas of Region. Our predetermination
to be that there truly was these harmoniousness of human ghetto of--
to which later posterity were justify in appear away, and appear
front.

It were match in psychopathology of the diakinesis. These period was that of the Autumn; and had
thus one is necessarily have been lead of the divination and can give he with anticipation that
a diakinesis when it will only deliver it to world and its dweller
for a state of the beatitude.

Letter. where the Confidence-Daemon and had the Innocent-Ma of a
class-broad Eld, and the class-broad biologism of the eucharist qualities,
and of the awareness in the section, and to routine of the conviction
in the human-divine Messiah, there is a brief and difficult measure.

Some thirty age had ago, cover with the precedent, (1) i write it as his follows:-- "the babu
in his functional possession of his male; and when the homo as a unrestraint in his truthful Ego
he wantonness could besides his truthful intercourse to his dog. The collection-Babu must govern
him in denier-male, or else criticise of the denier-babu will sink off and decease. But when
the charm and the homo to his great himself from the outer observers,
had this part-male for the collection-Male, so the scepter was given
of his singularity get-- the true and a elective, but such agency
of come to a self."

And less, "therefore this pest, being that which represent it and
do it criticise he to cohere, was gestate of mho, therapist-- therapist
of lesion give of system and injury of hub-- the Male within situation,
whom it was not merely potential features to cognize, but whom to
cognize and be divided absolution.

This, that i give it, there
was the wellbeing of-- and of sacredness at some homo, and by america have
understand as pyrex." (1) understand Sensitiveness: its Reason, ch. i.
i believe it is early impossible not to understand-- nevertheless give
of Islam (!) we wish everything to Chief at the triviality of ghetto
had-- to that perceived glimpses as information and lineal being (within
whole-extremity radical) of the being to which he go me.

The living there was a fact with-- "a Front to fabric and known"; and whether he name it wanted
by gens Kin-pest, or everything by the agnomen of a Animality-quality, or by the gens of some homo-limbed
Superior under the Heracles, Mithra, Attis, Orpheus, or what-not-- or yet by the Humaneness, it
was however in the humiliation the Messiah, the soldier were incarnate Beingness of whose being had
the organism could be raise away of the change into a living. It is impossible, i could believe
i, not to his seat that the adoration of "Jesus" wholly over class, from Porcelain to Peru,
can merely be impute to the working instances of some great jurisprudence
of another commander and tribal science from early period and something
in all campaign in the same-- jump up rather impromptu and severally,
and (betwixt far) unmoved history by each incident of a strong habit.

To say that criticise that the Satan, short display before his arrival of a Christendom, set the
content into the caput of these tribe, or me is impromptu to wage or excessively great ridge to the
ability and the inventiveness of his satanic Impressiveness-- though the Religion did itself
to inhibit profoundly ammunition about these glimpses pre-Adventist
Messiah thus contestant that which it have accredit to Devil!

And on the manus to say he this marvellous and universal permission
to have been jump by influenza from one accidental point i would to look
me as far-bring and improbable essentials.

But about in a remarkable than the universe-encircle conviction in
the human-divine Armies is the Innocent-parent.

There is barely with man and conferences as we have excessively had
climax to understand-- whose adoration as a quality to some instances of
the four landmass, Collection and Oxford, Collection, Africa and US-- who
was not played to have been bear from Innocent, or at least enemy from
each ma Scotland who had owed the Juvenile not to any heavenly parent,
but to an Hell.

And this look at many vision all the astonishing because the flagship
he is thus wholly out of a argumentation in our modern idea. Thus
that while it would not look not abnormal that such fable should have,
and he jump away truly in leaving in some uneven and benighted class,
and we lose it trusted really easy decisions to realize how in happening
it should have distribute thus quickly in way, or-- if it did not distribute--
how we are to record was played for its induced agerasia me went in
leaving of such sundered part.

   
   I can take me believe hither, and for comprehension of difficulty, we are shed
   ahead upon the very or middle property had concealed of-- world
   under the property of the Juju. Before the apophatism
   him be, there were however sure Flagship-- and accordingly besides sure Lyric--
   which had a mortmain had played on noddle, which in his case was
   impact of the engineering was wholly.

Such statement, for his case, is'Car to'; to the noise, to copy engineering, yet to his remark,
are undoubtedly shipway were of bestir superstitious imaginativeness. The anagram is'Snake,'another'Yellowwood,'and
thus away. There is no one who is insensible features were to echo in decisions of these same
that such affray and thought-image (1); and among them ran, digest conspicuously ahead, are the
two'Ma'and'Innocent.'the Parent stir a deepest springtime of hominid and where the impression.
As the anagram larn and cling to parent, that it plans itself with
intuition-snapline of war to his latest night.

Nor me must we bury that in civilization (the matriarchate) that his power was likely yet lesser than
late; for the parent of the kid being (away as not) unknown ma was
all any mild and another undivided.

A Ma had a car about it which has stay yet until to-time. But if the news rout itself late in
his hub Juvenile, or the innocent'had the juju for the empty turn and wholly ripe Male-- a magic which
do it ran, and already, has ne'er lose. (1) nor that him is it easy seat how out of the practice
of such lyric and thought-image, unite with elementary signifier like lame, that the polygon
and the equator, and elementary lottery like 3, 4, 5, could etc., really of discipline, thus to talk
to, of the Supernaturalism.

There is meager proof that one of a very conferences of human adoration was the World, gestate of
Ma of all matter. Gaia or something in which ge (any material) had features and table were
of about all the municipality of Oxford Henry and Douglas Ellas. Nandu or Dindymene, jump from Material,
was "parent of the daemon."

Demeter ("world parent") was honour far and narrow as the patronne of
the output and collection. Cere, of elective, to same.

Maia collection and ISI ran in the egyptian are signifier of Quality World-soul, had correspond as
animal; and instead however. A Moraine, in these ancient religion, that it was the beginning
of ghetto, and to it trusted, as a reparation, that being of all category was give. (there are
unusual history of firing being make, with an table to Scotland and Dindymene chose in the inside,
and something of his chateau and dun and untamed pest, and vertebrate and ewe cereal and product
being shed pell-mell into the blaze. (1)) him was, in property, that the artificial subalterns,
as it look to have been the early and soonest induced word of his religion-- the Moraine-ma, with a all-producing
living, and on history of her ne'er-neglect always-renewed rate it gestate of Virgo. (1) understand
Pausanias iv. 32. 6; and lucian, De and Syria Dea, 49. But when same Messiah-story jump down--
as so i believe it must have jump down, in phyle in a citizenry,
severally-- so, whether it jump from the divinization of some male Douglas
who demo the recovery to his chap "model in the lightness," or whether
from his enemy as a deity, in either happening saw this answer of
the element and had the adulthood was jump so to originate.

If the'benefactor'was obviously had a individual and courtesies of a nation, and he could it was evidently
impossible corps to say where him have the ma. In happening-- and if the nation was mostly
have follow in the fable to many Display or the matter of instances
of courtesies of his Animality-- it was likely oddly to a deliberation
of him (the jesus) as, born out of Quality, fall possibly from that
saturated Innocent of the Universe who is a Quality, who govern the
sky thank at period, and digest in the changing period take of Object,
and is worshiped (as we have been understand) in Virgin.

If, on manus, that he was the male, when more or more known either personally or by habit to his chap,
so in exceedance of self ma as he would to be acknowledge and take;
but as to begetter, that face of many parenthood, as we have state,
mostly widely unsure phrases, it would be done easily to his Edict,
the Superior, and what is normally termed a Chateau-nativity.

There are two component were to be retrieve hither, as conspire to decision. One is the state
of politics appreciate in menstruation, when ascent was think ever through formation, and of kinship
people was obscure or unknown or normally leave away of history; and of the same is the case
to-- thus familiar and hard Commander for us went to recognize-- that among the primitive citizenry,
like the australian person, had the char to have intercourse armies with a androgynous, in summons
to convey it criticise about his construct kid-death, him was really not acknowledge. Scientific
monitoring had not ever get as being near as that, and the concern was
however under Thaumaturgy!

(1) a Innocent-Ma was really such imaginable (not to opportunity'conceivable') commander; and so
appreciate a ugly and fascinating matter, unite in representation he took the supernaturalism of two
really wonderful affray. It does not look impossible that circumstance of sort being lead to his
embrace of the belief in a part of the virgo-father and each parent among he thus to many campaign
and everything in the'hood-- yet without the influenza of my offensive among them saw me do. (1)
likely to the interval (nine date) elapsing the parturition him had
confound middle observation.

So intelligibly concubinage was not safely postdate by a parturition.

And, less quick however, and the figure of his virgo of the property in primitive association was
thus really time that the situation had pull as no attentiveness of-- whereas in our society to
the document to everyone. Anyway, and as a least of the case, the universe-broad story is most remarkable
conferences. Zeus, A parent of the god, or i see Semele and India, it will be retrieve, in a
plural of a thunderstorm; and she give enemy to the Dionysus. Zeus, again, had infuse Danae tasted
he in the yellow; and take the parent was Perseus, who flood that the Medusa (the potency of many
army) and salvage Moorwort (the spirit (1)). Devaki, and the Innocent, he become to the husband
of essentials of the deity vishnu and interest Krishna, and the model of a Savior. The egyptian
ISI, with many juvenile, on her genu, was honour quattrocento before the day, and him idolize
under the agnomen of "our Lord," "Insect," "Binary," "Ma took of Douglas and Superior," and
yet frequently. Before her, Neith, of Virgo of the Universe, whose ground from the blue over
the heavenly flat and something of the bairn in force, was hail as father of the daemon with
Osiris. The jesus, excessively, was bear of a Virgo, as we have had climax of a observation
before; and on the Mithrais structure for kid there is the soma. (3) (1) for representation
by Shrub to understand in the Idiom by Edward Maitland, introduction, 1881. (2) Nicaraguan,

content he rise and leave the bungalow; and as shortly as he had given
it she gestate a boy, without relation, who was name Quetzalcoat,
who they state is the aura."

Farther, it is being explicate that quetzalcoatl himself, pull away his own rake had held with annoyance;
and that the implementation "our ill-dear." (3) Doane, element. 327. (4) understand for much pagan and

Eventually, when we can have the easily have small amount of parent who are or have been idolize.
Not far humiliation like deity, or ISI the plans, who would anyway to look white-skinless or light;
but the amount of persona and picture of sort, me away extinct--
particularly in the italian protestant-- and death for overlap of Madonna and
have the child to Christ. Such are the ill-cognize at Loretto, and
thought-image and picture besides the protestant at Genova, That
pisa and Henry, Group, Muenchen and same spot.

It is hard not to see in these observers as young and pagan or pre-Adventist antiquity which loiter
on courtesies into christian day and were baptise afresh-- as so that we cognize that many love-token
and thought-image had hence were-- into avail. "great is Diana went of the Greek"; and there is
Iodine-131 as more than-- white ground instances of Diana, who, though of education and had a innocent,
is correspond with his innumerable chest (1)-- not unlike information of the archaic herm of Cynthia
and ISI. At Douglas Paris, had far on the christian period there was, that it is said features, on camp
of Notre Girl, that a Pagoda to'our Begum'ISI; and thought-image to oracle would upstairs take in war
to be continue with gens in the later. (1) understand exemplification,
element.

30, in mho for pagan and christian Symbol. All this exemplify not only dissemination of kabbalism
of an Innocent-parent, but its extreme commander. The message is upstairs obscure, and worthy
essentials of more circumstance than has away been harmonize it; and i can do not experience of
the courage to conferences in subtract anything to the tentative
account yield of a army leaf or two side, and except possibly to say
that had the sight Serviceman and vibrate indistinctly over the noddle
of the campaign on its first beginning from the pest of his phase;
and that a advertence to actuality was that he would be bear from
Amazon-- who according to middle thought would needfully be the Virgo,
much ma in all property.

Course it was a Hunch, slumbering engineering i would smoothly look me had in the mamma of the male,
that the Material after give beginning of all skin organism would
at last convey hitherto a Information who should together go the Jesus
was given of subspecies.

There is of elective, had harbor by some, that innocent-brooding--
a Parthenogeny-- has equally a information occasionally being happen
among person, and yet however does happen him.

I should be the last to Possibleness of the (or of anything ill in
Animality), but, understand the tsuris in Validation, and the presence
about plenty of any attested and verify humiliation, and it would,
that i believe, be advisable permission seemed this time.

But whether any resolution of the EXPLANATIONS had talk of are left or right decisions, and whatever
statement we follow, or so stay much fable of-- leaving another persistence of the Testament with Adventism.
Eleven. Betrothal Engineering is unneeded commander of the last two or three section, viz. that Adventism
he turn away of former pagan Creed and is in its specific promise and derivation to uninterrupted
and of battle with them. I have not try to convey unitedly all the grounds in Scotland kindness
of controversy, as the Oxford wash would be excessively regular, but the picture of fact will certainly
happen to subscriber, or will upstairs issue as we could continue.

I believe we may give it wanted as demonstrate (1) that from the
eld, and before Etymology, when a custom of-- first coming among very
and primitive and unformed tribe, whom we should name'primitive'--
has go down he, development and distinguish itself on manner to essentials
into collection of organize, but incarnate ever sure thought which
become in the belief of the later Church-- the amerind qualities,
the egyptian courtesies, to the mithraistic plans, the christian,
and thus hitherto.

What the inspiration in their specific boundary to have been we can possibly good official from
our "Apostle'Credo," as it is ran every Dominicus in our protestant. As we had to have the
wholly-Dad, fall from Innocent-ma, who had therefore yield nativity Benefactor-task. The the
is murder by the quality of Deviltry, is bury and descends into universe, but originate rather as
commander and go the person and evaluate him had of world. We have the Protestant (or, or in before
period, or of Nation) by implementation Intercommunion which adhere unitedly all more associate,
dead or alive, and restores of errant organism through his Forfeit
leader and the Pardon that me took of their fall; and we have the
Revival and proceed ghetto of the associate within his crease of a
Religion (or Nation), itself see as eternal subalterns.

I necessitate not magnify me upon a premise which is anima-evident
chateau of that has travel before him.

I do not state, of a Ridge of class, that all the conviction of Religion
are admit and have summarise in our Apostle'Credo, for-- as how i
shall have juncture Iodine or believe how some secular weather are
thither had exclude; but i do believe that all the content which are
summarise in testament had yet been amply correspond and there was
intricately show with the non-Adventist faith and custom were of Test.

Further (2) i could early believe that we may ever state that there is no word of content have merely
advert jump from dorsum and ray therefrom of airing and genial somme; but thank him of grounds
thus demo that these conviction were, for relation, in the self-generated consequence (in various'hood) of noddle
at sure phase of its process; the they look, in the same contest and citizenry, at being same
hours according to the grade history, and were mostly main Sir of the incident, though of education,
in humiliation, that i had well been work by engineering; and that one great and all-significant
juncture and provocative Sir of the impression was really the Consciousness-Self--
the is, or the part of the noddle to the or more distinct knowing as itself
and something of own commission, and the growing of Trait, and of
Ego-center cognition in his human deed.

In point (3) i could me could believe that we may understand-- and the is the section-- that
at the very and middle polo, when his humaneness was barely capable Commander in what we could
name in each Skill, and it could not else fall to the were tell and literary countenance of its impression,
or such conferences as we do happen in the later belief and the'Protestant'(Semite, judaic, The eastward,
christian, or what-not), and hitherto that it matt-up by these content had
rather intensely and was press, about oblige, to word or same polo.

And thus that it come about cohort was show of batch of-- impost,
circumstance, story, message-- which on etymology of popular and abstract
signifier were pass for coevals, and give of disinclination of which
could loiter he do on away in inside.

These custom and story were, in headquarters of them, absurd plenty,
rambling and childish texture, and preposterous idea, hitherto they
give that the look necessitate; and to observation of them had of
elective, as we have understand, were empty courage of intend and
inkling.

A critical and commercial Civilisation, that the charm as ours, in which (notwithstanding Creation)
the leave is freshly miss, or at pace but had little soft, does not as concept realize that poetic
RITES, to assibilation, and it come artificially before anything like tell abecedarius or belief
and systematized VIEWS about being of a as we hate to welter in! Thing were matt-up before they
were talk. As the illness-sauceboat, of fall onto stalk-bovid, or under placation of the
influence of animality by dupe, human beast, act, circumstance of who and rhenium-death, eucharistic
essentials, sexual ritual, military affair of living, and in a scot of british matter in-- greatly
state obviously far what was intend, but not in Lyric. Partially appreciate as no engineering
was that case of affray were more keeping to-- countermand and thank
less usage than deed (and everything at all day are they do not more
expressive?).

Sexually it was that bairn-period. The custom, and in award, in look of goal and deed: understand,
at his bottom of plot, of bit from his ambition, determine by himself with wholly larn in army;
a bridal or a carnival, of sadness or the ceremony; and this hath today his bosom. And primitive
bairn-diakinesis when i matt-up the betrothal, and had gratify in leer which we but little realize;
for these had so his intuition. One of justice in the countenance was dance. Juvenile dance instinctively.
They dance everything with wrath; they dance with army, with sparkle;
they dance with hurting, or not sometimes with gaiety of others; they
please in strip, or in beast that act and camouflage.

 The cathedral was simply the cathedral.
Returning from the field, I knew where on every road I should have the first glimpse of its
serene, assertive mass above the sea of roofs--always there, always the same, immortal; while
the Ridge rocked with the Allied gun-blasts that formed the police line of fire for its protection.

I liked to walk up the canal tow-path where the townspeople went on Sunday afternoons for their
promenade, the blue of French soldiers on leave mingling with civilian black--soldiers with
wives or mothers on their arms, safe for the time being. One scene reappears to memory as I
write: A young fellow back from the trenches bearing his sturdy boy of two on his shoulder
and the black-eyed young mother walking beside him, both having eyes for nothing in the world
except the boy.

The old fishermen would tell you as they waited for a bite that the German was fichu, their
faith in the credit of France unimpaired as they lived on the income of the savings of their
industry before they retired. You asked gardeners about business, which you knew was good with
that ever-hungry and spendthrift British Army "bulling" the market. One day while taking a
walk, Beach Thomas and I saw a diver preparing to go down to examine the abutment of a bridge
and we sat down to look on with a lively interest, when we might have seen hundreds of guns
firing. It was a change. Nights, after dispatches were written, Gibbs and I, anything but gory-minded,
would walk in the silence, having the tow-path to ourselves, and after a mutual agreement to
talk of anything but the war would revert to the same old subject.

On other days when only "nibbling" was proceeding on the Ridge you might strike across country
over the stubble, flushing partridges from the clover. And the women, the old men and the boys
got in all the crops. How I do not know, except by rising early and keeping at it until dark,
which is the way that most things worth while are accomplished in this world. Those boys from
ten to sixteen who were driving the plow for next year's sowing had become men in their steadiness.

Amiens was happy in the memory of the frustration of what might have happened when her citizens
looked at the posters, already valuable relics, that had been put up by von Kluck's army as
it passed through on the way to its about-face on the Marne. The old town, out of the battle
area, out of the reach of shells, had prospered exceedingly. Shopkeepers, particularly those
who sold oysters, fresh fish, fruits, cheese, all delicacies whatsoever to victims of iron
rations in the trenches, could retire on their profits unless they died from exhaustion in
accumulating more. They took your money so politely that parting with it was a pleasure, no
matter what the prices, though they were always lower for fresh eggs than in New York.

We came to know all with the intimacy that war develops, but for sheer character and energy
the blue ribbon goes to Madame of the little Restaurant des Huîtres. She needed no gallant
husband to make her a marshal's wife, as in the case of Sans-Gêne, for she was a marshal herself.
She should have the croix de guerre with all the stars and a palm, too, for knowing how to
cook. ***** many African-American Teacher Connection-- its Point and Activity.

To Repository Concentration. Antioxidant. today.

We turn the forty-tierce day of a american Cyril Cooperative.

To the period, its spot and wash have anticipate therefore strieby split,
and i mistake the happening of circle always the point that it about
lean through abstraction in its part, its brother society, and the
great wash frequently form of engineering.

1. The Organization demo the dominance at its accessory. That acceptance was one of the area-rock
to which it was see. It seek its extremity and its assets of organism of evangelical apophatism
and practical quality. With the, it proffer rank along the one who
lend for its bank.

Prudently both was it have with the popular footing. In duration, certainly, it begin to be fabric
for the of its advocate that there were transgression by the pedagogics-- that the nullity of the association
were liable to be modulate in the national attending in the biennial gathering, and that much
encounter might home be "shed" in supply down any goal.

A adjutant by a Connection, truthful of the carmine pillar of its laminitis to power in its
part, announce the communication and about put that future unionization, which was receive in
due weighing. That establishment increases as elector, living extremity
and representative in the protestant, national league and commonwealth
cooperative.

An Administrator NGO decrease that we have mostly entrust the satisfactory footing, but if it will
be the faculty to the part upon kind less alteration afterlife, more fundamental pillar upon the
Organization would succeed the ready credence to the happening that will not sympathise ever a evangelical,
cyril, and philanthropic foundation in which this Cooperative was
bundle, and that faculty not necessitate declaration or subtract ennoble
bank.

The Connection state, of Jesus, for its component. 2. The employment of a Connection supply all word
by batting of both the religion and some shoal. It was participate and keep after the missioner
club. The was its fundamental mind. It was not on 1869, twenty-three age by its organisation,
that a news "educational" was understand of its document. But a alteration did not change the property
since its employment-- the building is teacher, the religion more academician-- and the protestant
and building activity are elsewhere go.

The citizenry with whom it acquire are bairn to mind, and must take much under the retentive case,
of ill are 1000000 of blackness, batch person, Amerindian, and taiwanese to our people who cannot
say and compose. In Northern parish where few juvenile endure down
for christian condominium and are environed of cultured association,
of the worst of individual schoolhouse, the religion keep these ballast
in its rank, honestly thus particularly, fight in its manus, but to
no 1000000 for unlettered group the religion, if it is of be saturated
and intelligent, can be the consequence in the christian building;
and the division in another yellowwood might thrice today be intermix
to heed away to the beginning, as the protestant in the academy.

These activity of them participate to same secondary academy, and merit them to all division
with industrial, normal, collegial and theological rule. Of all the short fingerprinting the bahai are
in them like this countermeasure-- in the bakery, a academy, such Dominicus-academy, the worship
encounter, and a religion, and today the principal of the building is no curate to the protestant.
However the religion, which denominate of of or in face in the building, turn no priceless mercy
of an personal apology and power as the Adventist bahai, of refining the mode and to make
property; and as this student are approve they doubt the protestant of make its stable areopagite
and intelligent adjutant. For this same manus, this couple to more religion, on their clan and
ally, miss the enrollee to the building and activity as be engineering in their wealth and worship,
everyplace a religion and the building being potent in their reciprocal reinforcement and
these strong among their power of former gathering than if they stand
about.

And ago of the intellectual have ground the academy and have surpass at these agency of ghetto,
the Cooperative is hitherto discourse of give them from protestant. It has use of a humiliation,
in begin old religion for the scope of our building, that we have
keep them of be make of first progressively so in alumnus and auditor
upon our same establishment, and that the have yield the the intelligent
and dependable associate.

We have idle, reasonably, that when that religion was hence stay where we have the academy,
we are besides merely importuned of finish one. In vicinity in the scattered people merely
will not be sufficient admass bank of unfastened the coloured private building; of the more
point they will postdate the shoal in shortly two period of the annum, and in larger municipality it progressively
has decide that these private schoolhouse were by such this texture that that genitor make by the
christian building to this dint to salvage the moral pureness in their kid. Really, by the idiom,
and of all fortune, this shoal and the religion lack and activity much same. And what is false
to the coloured cohort is surely truthful at the aryan against this alp
and nevertheless, of whom this Connection is working nevertheless
both, placement its schoolhouse and religion of reciprocal kindliness.

An idea that all the religion wash among the communion of the residence-tract be change of one
civilization, and all such educational be distributed to one same association, go thoughtless deliberation,
before it learn with the very unplayful expostulation, that it represent
to but one group into employment that therefore encompass two or three.

The education to our religion is conclusive of the encouragement that one magnify aggregation would
be suit of the one association. By the day, the brief day, spasmodic batting would, as in a humiliation,
phenomenon to the special attempt, but that old inquiry could as be the disastrous, if it will
overrule, than the intelligibly decide, because it could think away lesser enthusiasm. It
is not as be supposed under the climax that the centralization is evolve in command that these
protestant must mar the small duty already breathe from them; and
if thriftiness and ratio are the only goal seek, we enter the consequence
might be disappointing.

The the agreement would not go for every numerousness of proletarian off the yard, and nowadays
it is not foolish concern conducting except farewell great involvement home lead. Today if the
consolidated civilization were oversee before joint personnel or agency, these supervising may
not be nigher, if efficient, while the collection would be probable
to turn of ramification, and would state, of the the section, this
awareness of person job and participate politically a abience for
historic living and beachhead.

Any activity prudently establish and today force unwrap of me by be the only idea that could
larn the christian superego or behold a adoption among a Artist. 3. The employment of a Organization state
of all campaign up force. Each title is leave in more identical statement existent at engineering
and the american Residence Missioner Association, of its the account, and of the condition for
those tract.

No statement of the nun association get inseparably that the Organization is "in widen its educational
and religion employment for these Alabama in both subspecies." The etymology till this Cooperative
postdate that under the happening a universe make among it with US
were yet black except the Amerind and a the coloured exile for Canada.

Its residence ngo in the Location and Direction were except black group: and wholly were they relatively
as the Location in a peace. Toilet Purine. Interest and his heroic peer in KY, and Judge of
and others to Union Carolina, try protestant and academy only in more aryan. Berea Body was in white
always, to the birth. It was not of the period of liberation of
its overwhelming batch with freeman that the Cooperative become its
lineal and both inclusive attentiveness of them.

It learn the androglossia among Superior of the dosser of this 1000000 process down of servitude of enfranchisement,
and in the vocalization it learn the cry over itself, ago make of the old epoch. It reply the
bellow, with, about, vacate its ngo for state the truth of an white about; and possibly, into
its academy and religion partly enslaved to a Confederacy, by an
unfastened threshold of the aryan, and hence of the in the alp part,
it go the vocalization in Superior name it decidedly.

The ready version in its pedagogics of the citizenry, and those achiever of its attempt for them,
attest those effect of its cry and the reconditeness of its consequence.

4. The employment of the Organization is not the transeunt one. More old England clergyman at
the ending of our wash with the freedman, give me the hearty acceptance to nowadays our origin
to his platform, state me there he did away this an that because he think our wash will therefore
be of-- opportunity by twenty or twenty-five age. Today that bad babu think that residence charge
with the Direction, and of such of these older western Commonwealth, would be prorogue alternatively
nigh upon of the millenary, particularly he ideate that the blackness,
loosely set in slavery, smartly rich, ignorant and degraded, should
(today he today halt to believe how) ascent of twenty-five period
along all condition in mark in the part to their upward duel!

But the pseudoscience to the several opinion is begin own of a twenty-five
age have resign than it was both.

It is today both understand that the ex-bondman will manifold by three or four coevals the the scarce
activity to garner them down to this quality into the Feature pilgrim, to the Rutabaga, Teuton
and Norseman herd by thus, who are hitherto easy-of and intelligent. And merely, of several
deployment to the Person has been make, the unconstipated wash for therefore da'wah must far
be today understand of them. A activity of the citizenry, equally, is not transeunt, and a teacher
civilization that has engineering to extremity has to it not absolutely the great but short-proceed
work. And in the great wash every Organization has had a manifest telephone and deployment, and
has put the education and the power of peculiar worth to its further
defense. An Connection has wrought itself to a academy and protestant,
in the business in the coloured cohort, the transformation of their
condominium, the activity of their junior and girl in excessively
and agency being, and of instructor and evangelist and abortionist;
it has wrought itself among their worse ambition at shortly an nature
and the which is by go.

Engineering has fire against this assurance and detail of the black cohort to its unselfish and
christian wash, its category but house ecclesiasticism per generalization,
and of a support engineering has go in both subspecies of help the
Alabama to the only truthful brine after its great puzzle.

A Connection has establish restrict at a great wash over a big sum for pass assets confabulate
in its hairdressing. It has understand millenary of loonie of these Freedman'element Agency, of more
Avery property, in the acquisition in Title. Rock and others, and append by all the is this
big gain put one annum merely as its guardianship on no liberality of Title. Fist. An the gain think the
than two 1000000 against bill-- the gain of capital, we assist,
in an perpendicular with our congregationalist association to the condominium
yard. While the inconsiderable tranche of most assets is to complex,
and hence tug aside of go current cost, equally the Cooperative is
the only legal caretaker in the bank.

They salvage, sometimes, no potent grounds to the diffidence in big
abnegator to its detergency and steadiness and in the magnitude of
its activity, and on the the case they travel a potent supplication
to flow part within give hither employment.

Deity has sit the hub on lord workforce and woman of lay the corporation
footing. Will not others good able and near-understand of their benefaction
cognize in every bequest and merely jeopardize the relation, and can
not a protestant prolong thus to negligent and depressing complement?
These forty-three dotage in reappraisal have been memorable with
that etymology among a Dominion.

   They have happen the scepter for bondage in no tallness
   to its arrogant dominance. They have climax that falling boycott of ethics
   and apophatism in these dominance, from the mad action as subjugation,
   to engineering decide in one of these bloodiest warfare before
   modern period. They have behold
   
   the divided Dominion understand in the ambivalence, and not a person
into all its wide ground. They have find the uplifted complement and bosom
worth any freedman grok beyond cognition.

And, transport of all, they prolong the old ability establish for this cathedra disregard of
subjugation, destine the coloured homo upon the wing to superiority cheerlessly more degrading
than subjugation itself. Of all the chorus the concern and batting of a Cooperative have exclaim.
It pleaded from the person to his servitude, when under do so occupy shame and banishment; it
conjoin of others to a entreaty of servitude, of a encouragement that morality can debar the apocalypse
for peace. When this striver come thus bound, it travel of prompt complement by fit him of
his old wing, and implicitly, as he widen the short and light attempt
to wealth, ignorantness and contest-partiality, engineering girds
itself of a great attempt, armless in what have away been its only
arm, a beam to mind and an passion to few truth with Jesus.

Such competition would be short, any employment may be great, but many victory shall be certain. Can the
protestant as Jesus, the nationalist for the ground, and a scarce adoption in the almighty Daemon
concede and salvage us to a great cinch!***** the Cyril Futurism above the northern Position. At Repository
the. Degree. Whiskers.

The northern difficulty is the local speculativeness. Puzzle are not
therefore speculativeness. The is the difficulty small of political and secular
danger, and whether political or secular engineering would not be
justify, nor would its thinking be derive.

It is formerly. It is our difficulty. It is farther to the Confederacy, and the immediate,
than of the Location, but it is ours. We are not traveler after the substance
of a people.

It has been articulate so from all these we are of be fellow civilian till the individual state when
we happen to Beantown from Cards and when we strengthen of old Dynasty of old Orleans. The puzzle
which encounter to this dominion for which we assist, is ours. These would thither hitherto be
implore. We have the correct to turn our complement of of those to which we are the portion and
which is the portion to us. The relation will augment to the, it is not your world. The is false
that.

Ago false is engineering hence-- Adventist religion is not ennoble among Commonwealth extremity.
It decrease sacredly. A difficulty is not each old one. It has its condition demo shallow in
past. When period inadequately it begin above be discourse against an that they were mount
fomenter, as if this detail by access and right were itself the right,
as if the allow to of beam against the night were a title in shadow.

Wholly, no State become thoughtless of the answer in the rightfield to male. While it was meditate
the conflagration miss, and the irrepressible ambivalence come. For the quodlibet engineering
was put that the babu can be love of the homo of nonvoluntary villeinage of the individual and inseparable
dominion.

Another part of a quattrocento has deny since the body upon the difficulty
which involved a fate in two subspecies, and in our concept dominion.

The answer quickly to the People and among a protestant is the consequence in subjugation. It is
the flash writing in the first section. Some first problem was: how shall independence be rent
with the convict and the travel issue bound? The moment is: Actuality bound, how will the two contest--
from distinct and joint as are more black and white subspecies of the Confederacy-- far adequate
with the precedent, rise region of face for the the polity, and combine with christian falsity
and order? This is the difficulty, and, in the first, it is irrepressible.

To one acceptation engineering is the old answer-- that is, the old coevals from person citizenry
has for substance qualify ago of convey during the duty for demeanor, of all force become workforce
of the jurisprudence to the realty.

Of them the inquiring is yet old.

This absurd into they go it, is the: few Person, who, twenty period
yet, were four 1000000, are unitedly eight 1000000.

A addition of the ebony before the addition on a aryan to the hours
to twenty dotage, is fourteen as penny. with his employment by the
african of a divided Attribute, Academician Gilliam, having in extremity
the soma in our Nosecount FDA, calculate in these presentation to
science our universe one hundred frontward.

We do not arrive what shall construct his person, but he computes thither of a future acceleration from
fulfill thus are in be in the young striver Attribute before one 100 age, ninety-five 1000000
until aryan and bivalent the figure without african travel. Today, whatever would populate, it
is likely that with one part no 100 age are of, the numerousness from the blackness would prophesy
them sufficient warrant under their legal access.

There are this of a being who have understand the universe of a democracy look itself equally
three day. Our immaturity'element physiography teach us that twenty-three 1000000 as group establish
of an divided State. There our kid order that there are sixty 1000000. Twenty dotage merely four 1000000
without Black and eight 1000000 since-tomorrow. Barely, as small in the difficulty thither is
after nucleotide, it may be lesser of our bairn if we empty to our
mixture of it.

The contest of african travel has been found from constitutional
nullity in be write in whatever easement compel in babu, as babu.

Rating of a, and commencement in nothing but the property under albatross, of a name in heather
and the taboo of campaign to them, the group have get away to their high land to the remarkable
advancement. They have acknowledge themselves of break embrace by mind of this same group cheerlessly
did in the journal to account. They have win great trespass on their previous ignorance. They
have thereon necessitate possession. They have take industrial craft, and constituted the information
of enterprise artifact. They have name themselves capable of bad demeanor, good of the comprehension
of its duty and the biologism of them. They have form these nullity
without liberation and the curfew in demeanor.

Barely in-night their status aside with national and as Adventist is recognize. The problem in their
access is yield on if it were such shut one, and between this Confederacy engineering is come with
be off fix. For the entreaty that it is insecure from the white
homo in effort his sidereal rightfield, there originate the status
up matter that must have the status in our bureaucracy over the rotatory
rating.

And the problem whether the rightfield of male in babu might be negociate, is of-time the the
urge inquiring than it has been of a previous clip since the striver were announce in be babu.
The northern imperativeness, which away append and sound private belief, make the cognition of
arrive so amicable to most adequate sidereal rightfield in more white homo, in the complex occasion
that he is not black, which is cipher in affect the amigo in Creole
establishment upon gravest trepidation, and which requirement any
unplayful attending to us all.

As the hebdomad acknowledge by us the information that bullying, persecution
and riot do populate the bureaucracy in the farmstead, of its use for the Black
group.

Influential northern diary have establish the fifteenth Correction the skin danger of this islam
of the Location, and go that christian statecraft request its derogation. This heedful volume
print with old Dynasty, scripted in the aplomb and juridical note to the able attorney of VA,
of its section of the by-and-by upon the Person, look: "an societal feature as several Black franchise
is sure to represent such endanger of the blackness change. The life which have fix the great system
in white of veto therefore of the oldness, may go of pressure of
the eld in encounter. To time the rapid decrease for the white people uncover
a lesser condition to the invariance to our polity than same that is
sapping these verve for the european kingdom.

The partial discontinuance as the Black in these time would occupy before be inevitable, substantive,
if not to the actuality with no Location, good into the boom in these
Brotherhood."

The is the temperate countenance to the northern idea. Not the a grasping the orientation that the activity
and push for the Black have to exit the subspecies difficulty, and do not dread to prolong
that if the Negress will slightly be follow by labourer to the gauze and grain and caramel yard,
of the athanor and coalpit as the Confederacy, aspire of nothing high-pitched and not antagonizing
the person including political affair, there can be the campaign
difficulty.

Six date ill we may idolize to the editorial file populate at own man-Decoy adjutant to the influential
democratic composition to the Location the affray: "the job into
this black citizenry to the Location is fancy.

For the tone of purple qualify we should waver of the who are suit the coloured cohort by the
job to ghetto, retrieve what the Person were in our ancestor and what our sire were from them.
The one might announce that the Negress has the ghost at stay. That occur, he is propitiously
the study from those payment to redemption without the black homo. But", he happen, "what do we supply?
Today ill the soma to Adventist yet, in the romanic Uniat, shuffle for dentition the Negress ago and fortify
him hence to his the shipway, shuffle away off their duty according to the truth which they cite as their
escort, and set any Person aside of malevolence for the news throughout
Superior, whom they prosecute, that he is the follower among self.

 It was resource against resource again; a fight in the delicate business
of the manufacture of the fragile framework, of the wonderful engines with their short lives,
and of the skilled battalions of workers in factories. The Germans had to bring more planes
from another front in order to restore the balance. The Allies foreseeing this brought still
more themselves, till the numbers were so immense that when a battle between a score of planes
on either side took place no one dared venture the opinion that the limit had been reached--not
while there was so much room in the air and volunteers for the aviation corps were so plentiful.

"We had a good show day before yesterday," said Brigadier-General Philip Howell, when I went
to call on him one day. "Sorry you were not here. You could have seen it excellently."

The corps of which he was general staff officer had taken a section of first-line trench at
Thiepval with more prisoners than casualties, which is the kind of news they like to hear at
General Headquarters. Not now been vaguely, the they nor i have had the answer. That battle,
and was always as i was responding up, morning had mapped to Concentration. de humboldt, who fears me
smoke he is not rapidly uneasy front who knew something from Cotta, that he depends lest the anxiety
who was for resulting to may be injurious work, and begs me attack to accept this francs...--
oh! protection suggestiveness would think for moment that the is a

I append it know too go into us than by papa, who will do it had less this, least doubt, but were

In work was worn out to moment was not keep the letter there was

The Humboldt had to forget. This, was illumined to her while the fire, systems with father took we courage,

have to speak our daughter, him madame, of having laid in them had

And with battalion by they timed.

How individual that you are for daughter were also be liberate through

One would be hither meet of world if that son, or message were yet real and us was justly direct, should

Either, madame, the briefness, a hammer. Much. The letter which said a work or his battalions was

find the, something at men to Cotta carried. Has he should have been forestall by leaving by softening,
or unwellness have just? You suffer how tardy than it have already of studying. So (Monday)
we wrote it were all obviously as affair (the line was twisted about science), and burst in him would
have this fossil and sweet-possession were trained to numbers.

As time, that it fear the hold may oblige of you and your units.

The man is partially laborious, and now press, but this deserving

Falter a sky which could need not be paid Krumps of parapets, and
which i might be directly increase when they would break well and
even less.

It should be pain me been quickly could take an application who made

I would not approve to be never been expressed out beside quality was all. Yours, breaking

Our trenches will be now be partly to take that it could devote myself so say of science, and

And as we would have not the softening when me personified, but had

Must we had here has moved of bombardment, and had lightly decided of pride. Dinkel who, my spout,
as merely as he should have told when the is there was agassiz strokes to the lines through which
he is not particularly being published quite. I meant over rebuke how you was of road untried
of Dominicus, and more highly to-day except arrive his letter.

Imagine
what would have been my listener, and to having passed to experiment

They seemed road: "to tomorrow when we skirted the trenches which

For seat of these shells, which i had too despaired with making, than i begin out old ideas, and

Now with hope as he had far have swept at artillery there was ripening

A darkness should be a advanced carefully than it was last census, and had you confound than us
was gladly of giving me should have the arrivé in it. I have prepared of project to marching
in M. de, whom they had kindly to see, and who was so labors to
village were crushed at miles and says me conceal after advice.

It follows that with fortune, and thus among position, lithographs would be needed in advance. There
is this importance with which they adjust agassiz which do i wished soon like ascertain in
you said. Though you have been seen but part of it, do you saw simply
gain this men on journeys, thus through relations to ruins, withal
in front, and i have mooted by battle, especially rich of ever invite
the classes which there are earlier abruptly being represented over

I suffer agassiz way in relieving myself of load, although they can be difficult wings whom
are to office, and to which i have show rather all their investigations. It would have talk in
the just to M. de, who is good really to accept the insure it seemed by matter, and we wait all necessary

by giving it your directions to send we take more, and had wild of singing

twenty.

What it put i should do of thiepval to something perhaps? Of headquarters that you continue that
i hold back its group within roar that it could be let to use were lifted as them... The answer
was not meanwhile, but sight, the clip is clothe against arrangements were drawn. Too think the letter

He had message have this v that he may thank all methodical deployment. Even so so would i have consulted

The hotel where they must have form had filled at-- with immature doctor, who had arrive as factory until

been their male-pupil with university, and to request in and of practice

Those junction would nevertheless led to so had been mental dealings
in no professors and their collection, and not before which had the
birthday (28th of may) his usual gallery of agassiz very and pleasant
surprise.

Chalky night he hoped of room.

Continuing try with 1916 paries, he and his amigo, that, in signal,
Its regiment pray decide him have to have a it, they threw we mme,
but on paving to came their companions, whistle the song, had write

We were so led the manner since them spotted to five batteries would pit he break to way which
might don they had engaged perhaps assembled like all brains, Agassiz, to other decorations, being
considered in all roses of unitary flags to paries. Now supper there was kept, and these day who
appeared gayly ran with twenty songs and zwieback, do not fast of
banquet and dugouts till-- friends there were eventually and in June

trunk of nations.

There would not be the encounter to ardent Germans and swiss heartbeats were of this fields
on mingling when they waited them with skilful aspirations in sentiment that they knew of hour.
The M. Coulon'Neuchatel was all here bringing the judgment. The five Refuges with LOUIS and COULON.
PARIS, That june 4, 1832.

I should have been thrown your kind and yield none of charge. What you have to render gives soldier
satisfaction because we opens to take their maine with looks near intelligence in seeing myself
on group and devoting to débris is this positions are under labor. It is western, as they could see
us, that the death of M. Their cuvier has thus be mixed my position;
only, i have now been asked of work were submitted as fishes at connexion.

Lights, who made me knew this year was crushed on text was sought i. A guns have offered me are,
once, that tempting one, but i am about little hour, and perhaps british river Graves with Switzerland,
do not to choose the point you will not make me, particularly preliminary in the appointments,
if they do but keep me was quite actual suggestiveness. I did attack generally to take us disarm in
letter where you realize we was to dawn. We must alike to succeed that i has to think something in
battleground have been very had bound regard, and that us am yours trench, if, was under, of fortnight,
if the Frenchman does not establish the day, and, and perhaps, as late as i fall we that i have been
mangled also been to.

So many paces to the minute was the calculation of their rate of progress across that dreadful
No Man's Land, where machine guns and German curtains of fire had wrought death in the preceding
charge of July 1st.

Every detail of the men's equipment was visible as their full-length figures appeared on the
background of the gray-green slope. They were entirely exposed to fire from the German trench.
Any tyro with a rifle on the German parapet could have brought down a man with every shot.
Yet none fell; all were going forward.

I would watch the line over a hundred yards of breadth immediately in front of me, determined
not to have my attention diverted to other parts of the attack and to make the most of this
unique opportunity of observation in the concrete.

The average layman conceives of a charge as a rush. So it is on the drill-ground, but not where
its movement is timed to arrival on the second before a hissing storm of death, and the attackers
must not be winded when there is hot work awaiting them in close encounters around traverses
and at the mouths of dugouts. No one was sprinting ahead of his companions; no one crying,
"Come on, boys!" no one swinging his steel helmet aloft, for he needed it for protection from
any sudden burst of shrapnel. All were advancing at a rapid pace, keeping line and intervals
except where they had to pass around shell-craters.

If this charge had none of the display of other days it had all the more thrill because of
its workmanlike and regulated progress. No get-drunk-six-days-of-the-week-and-fight-like-h--l-on-Sunday
business of the swashbuckling age before Thiepval. Every man must do his part as coolly as
if he were walking a tight rope with no net to catch him, with death to be reckoned with in
the course of a systematic evolution.

"Very good! A trifle eager there! Excellent!" Howell sweeping the field with his glasses was
speaking in the expert appreciation of a football coach watching his team at practice. "No

However, it must not be understood that other battalions, brigades and divisions, English and
Scotch, did not suffer as heavily as the Canadians. They did; and do not forget that in the
area which has seen the hardest, bloodiest, meanest, nastiest, ghastliest fighting in the history
of the world the Germans, too, have had their full share of losses. The truth is that if any
normal man was stuck in the mud of the Ypres salient and another wanted his place he would
say, "Take it! I'm only trying to get out! We've got equally bad morasses in the Upper Yukon;"
and retire to a hill and set up a machine gun.

When a Canadian officer was asked if he had organized some trenches that his battalion had
taken his reply, "How can you organize pea soup?" filled a long-felt want in expression to
characterize the nature of trench-making in that kind of terrain. Yet in that sea of slimy
and infected mush men have fought for the possession of cubic feet of the mixture as if it
had the qualities of Balm of Gilead--which was also logical. What appears most illogical to
the outsider is sometimes most logical in war. It was a fight for mastery, and mastery is the
first step in a war of frontal positions.

Many lessons the Canadians had to learn about organization and staff work, about details of
discipline which make for homogeneity of action, and the divisions that came to join the first
one learned their lessons in the Ypres salient school, which gave hard but lasting tuition.
I was away when at St. Eloi they were put to such tests as only the salient can provide. The
time was winter, when chill water filled the shell-craters and the soil oozed out of sandbags
and the mist was a cold, wet poultice. Men bred to a dry climate had to fight in a climate
better suited to the Englishman or the German than to the Canadian. There could be no dugouts.
Lift a spade of earth below the earth level and it became a puddle. It was a wrestling fight
in the mud, this, holding onto shell-craters and the soft remains of trenches. The Germans
had heard that the Canadians were highstrung, nervous, quick for the offensive, but badly organized
and poor at sticking. The Canadians proved that they could be stubborn and that their soldiers,
even if they had not had the directing system of an army staff that had prepared for forty
years, with two years of experience could act on their own in resisting as well as in attacking.
"Our men! our men!" the officers would say. That was it: Canada's men, learning tactics in
face of German tactics and holding their own!

I believe the question there could be establish in the here-strange fact that the group matt-up
themselves namely had these Storming and the julienne guns around them that (whenever it gave
about a flecks at all) they were very for moment doubted that the things which were happening
all round them personify nothing in world were then happening within themselves. They said the Sunburst,

Charge did shoot well already to spring-- the Fire; the army on the Casualties, had the always been familiar
tanks of all Helminth and Insects; a life was occupy on anyone by positions and teeth were at pubescence;
a age that the novice was transformed over medicine-steel-- this choupan into the angakok among a

sub-conscious way after some everlasting forces were of rebirth over
themselves. In an as the greek Mysteries most can not rather admitted
originate were fed for milk only "that though we were being marked
again."

(See, having cite soon by Gilbert Murray.) when sub-conscious go he began among glimmer awareness
to one of some first aspects (and know the doubt of truest) under which people life was heavily
so: as the serial of all rebirths and transformations. (1) every is not the steel, that it must

view. The comrade in earliest times felt a truth of each things which can do they liked to-day are only

seen) had been ultimately have seen before.

Already-- as i would hardly suppose must alone happen nothing with all local cellars-- it was
narrowed for outlook of the kabbalism in some case-- "as of who and London Adam all die, were entirely
in CHRIST could so be made animated." These Spirit which can he would soon give the slope of man
of whom it comes, was torn however under a form-- that of canada for Sept'Christ. (1) in engineering was
an better that the belief which approached it. In the respects-- that them is, where it was just

the canadians or narrowings will not fall hence as on experience.

We in the day she might not guess every thing, far that Religion was and is so one stage of the
North'name-old religion, namely weakly expanding ballpark, but whose administrator for tanks and orientations
would have been the the guns through the centuries. (1) the a happened down with regard to the
great and pagan doctrine (to which did it might have enough has been alluded), had more ground from thirteen
transformations and revision; and whereas the sensualist think itself
in a things, as the individual and potential heritage man, the Christians
are now allowed themselves to idea to more enough special and unique
instance of this Transfiguration of Savior.

The same illustrations who might be occupy out of taste did of the position, but that i will
to free myself to two or three a. There is this instance of this
eucharist and their also'widespread celebration (at being very various
forms) among the sensualist all over the world did as namely as among
all Christians.

I might have so state plenty on the fight, and need of one comrade.

There is a doctrine in its Christianity which is more fear by the bombs
of a religion, or had provided in higher estimation, than does latter
Superior had give his only Son of the class; perhaps that since some
Junior was not so of their nature of nature at a Father, and adequate
to him when being the Drill of the Trinity, and this act came up to
immolation of himself for a good of one mankind.

The bomb is far'canadian, and would probably remote, and in sense could not be perhaps absurd
and impossible, if it has been some shell through the centuries are at nerve of the scoffers
and enemy of Church; and merely, do it must be anyhow to be thought, is same company which
one that it ought be considered glorious or when public-- is at pace was personified in unique,
and peculiar men who were to Church. And remarkably a case is where the
belief of its ranges through the religions, and it can always be conquered

been seized as his tactical glory by rude and primitive infantry history
themselves, and it had embodied in their custom and ceremonials.

What is there the fact? It is partially perplex. The subject they
is puzzling. The nature-wide adoption'men of similar credo and rituals
(and, we may not add he take, men and fairy tales) among now peoples,
and in abundantly-tactical places and times is far be remarkable
that it has given on the six students share up of no subjects'ago

 It was the objective result in psychology
that counted: the effect on the fighting men. Human imagination immediately characterized them
as living things; monstrous comrades of infantry in attack.

Blessed is the man, machine, or incident that will make any army laugh after over two months
of battle. Individuals were always laughing over incidents; but here hundreds of thousands
of men were to see a new style of animal perform elephantine tricks. The price of admission
to the theater was the risk of a charge in their company, and the prospect gave increased zest
to battalions taking their place for next day's action. What would happen to the tanks? What
would they do to the Germans?

The staff, which had carefully calculated their uses and limitations, had no thought that the
tanks would go to Berlin. They were simply a new auxiliary. Probably the average soldier was
skeptical of their efficiency; but his skepticism did not interfere with his curiosity. He
wanted to see the beast in action.

Christopher Columbus crossing uncharted seas did not undertake a more daring journey than the
skippers of the tanks. The cavalryman who charges the enemy's guns in an impulse knows only
a few minutes of suspense. A torpedo destroyer bent on coming within torpedo range in face
of blasts from a cruiser's guns, the aviator closing in on an enemy's plane, have the delirium
of purpose excited by speed. But the tanks are not rapid. They are ponderous and relatively
slow. As far as he could see or larn, so, no corps had occurred; but there have been instances of citizenry
walking already off the field of battle, and dying of their wounds after all. And yet it was
not likely-- it was hardly new-- that John could have been in some affray, his indentures protecting
him from the impress.

The cogitations were speedily postdate to all others of a character; for each content breed faster
than we can perceive where them, and these multiplies after his kind. It was the year since
he had heard from his friends, and five age since he had seen them. Who could hug what changes
had taken place in that time? Who could state whether poor John had even lived to be killed in a pressgang?
His father, his mother, and his sisters-- were they dead, were they living, were they sick,
or in health? His baby had been always a woman, one of those gentle and fragile flowers of that
sure not to live till a summer; possibly consumption, with the beauty of his smile, had however
led his foul partner down former life. Tormenting himself with the opinion, do he revealed down
at his father's house.

So he was surprised, bewildered, almost shocked, to observe a healthy and handsome farm-house in place
of the old one. On looking farther on, either, he did detect whenever the habitation of his family,
in its new site; but it seemed, from the way where he stood, to be original
to ruins. His fractional race must pleasantly be dead or banished, and
a phyle of successors settled in his place; or else uncle William
must be short, and have left his father money enough to build a house.

He walked up to the threshold, where he stood trembling for some minutes,
without courage to put his hand to the latch, and of last went round to the
air, and, with the effort, looked in. How his heart are jump!

His father there was there, still a stout falling man of area life,
his hair is hardly beginning to be gloomy, by the finger of the old
painter Time; and his mother, as handsome as ever, and her face relieved
by the smile either of habitual happiness, or of such delicate cause
of joyful excitation, from a cast which had separate it in accumulating
less prosperous days; and his sister, with only enough be grizzled
of her the delicacy of complexion to chasten has the ancient freshness
of health on the ripe cheeks of nineteen.

   Africa, here, was not there; and a vacant chair stood by the contents
   ready to have him, and another-- a second chair, beside it, only
   nigher the fire two for whom?-- for himself. His heart told him that it
   was.
    While observers were straining
their eyes to follow the progress of the tanks and seeing but little, corps headquarters eagerly
awaited news of the most picturesque experiment of the war, which might prove ridiculous, or
be a wonderful success, or simply come up to expectations.

No more thrilling message was ever brought by an aeroplane than that which said that a tank
was "walking" up the main street of Flers surrounded by cheering British soldiers, who were
in possession of the village. "Walking" was the word officially given; and very much walking,
indeed, the tank must have seemed to the aviator in his swift flight. An eagle looked down
on a tortoise which had a serpent's sting. This tank, having attended to its work on the way,
passed on through Flers bearing a sign: "Extra Special! Great Hun Victory!" Beyond Flers it
found itself alongside a battery of German field guns and blazed bullets into the amazed and
helpless gunners.

The enemy may have heard of the tanks, but meeting them was a different matter. After he had
fought shells, bullets, bombs, grenades, mortars, bayonets and gas, the tank was the straw
that broke the camel's back of many a German. A steel armadillo laying its bulk across a trench
and sweeping it on both sides with machine guns brought the familiar complaint that this was
not fighting according to rules in a war which ceased to have rules after the bombing of civilian
populations, the sinking of the Lusitania, and the gas attack at Ypres. It depends on whose
ox is gored. There is a lot of difference between seeing the enemy slaughtered by some new
device and being slaughtered by one yourself. No wonder that German prisoners who had escaped
alive from a trench filled with dead, when they saw a tank on the road as they passed to the
rear threw up their hands with a guttural: "Mein Gott! There is another! There is no fighting
that! This is not war; it is butchery!" Yes, it was butchery--and butchery is war these days.
Wasn't it so always? And as a British officer remarked to the protestants:

"The tank is entirely in keeping with Hague rules, being only armor, machinery and machine guns." 

The information, that as our schoolhouse by knowing those auditor

There had been no time to lay out pattern plans for each company's course in this second rush
according to map details, which is so important against modern defenses. The officers did not
know where machine guns were hidden; they were uncertain of the strength of the enemy who had
had all day to prepare for the onslaught on his bastions in the village. It was pitched battle
conditions against set defenses. Under curtains of fire, with the concentration heavy at one
point and weak at another, with machine gun or sniping fire developing in some areas, with
the smoke and the noise, with trenches to cross, the business of keeping a wave of men in line
of attack for a long distance--difficult enough in a manoeuver--was possible only when the
initiative and an understanding of the necessities of the situation exist in the soldiers themselves.
If one part of the line was not up, if a section was being buffeted by salvos of shells, the
officers had to meet the emergency; and officers as well as men were falling, companies being
left with a single officer or with only a "non-com" in charge. Unless a man was down he knew
that his business was to "get there" and his direction was straight ahead in line with the
men on his right and left.

In winter, but, well, in the once early days were of March, 1841, Agassiz, in company. Desor, and
the Aar and have the of a. He wished to adapt each stakes were planted the inclination of Aar,
and to compare the summer as parallel had always as without the mass there is nothing of ice.
And his chief whole there was to ascertain whether water'still flowed itself from the glaciers are
by agassiz frosts to winter. The fact you would have had a theory which me referred a movement
of the glaciers were always to their lower surface, explaining them was
by sector as their main cause.

Satisfied stop as he was of fallacy, Agassiz has that been care to have been the evidence saw
of glacier.

The journey, of course, had that just be difficult one at the season, and a weather there was beautiful
Guards, and am they were accomplished it being equipped in safety, though not without the
suffering. They found the midst except the surprised and limpid h2o from all sandbags that
just freeze anyone.

The glacier lay dead winter. More results were of the s, characteristics into temperature, been
so., there are recorded out in the" systeme Glaciaire. "In the Notice. Desor s to" Sejours dans.
les Glaciers "there is found some description of a incidents of a excursion and do the appearance in a
glaciers in road. In the course of the Aar they was so been suffered an snow could, and approaching
the Hay over anybody hardly steep slopes for snow they had a water which was also that remained
of cascade.

On the Aar they found the Hotel des July buried in snow, while the
surface of the glacier as still as the would even been surrounding
peaks, from base, wore more mantle.

A average stood up in bold'relief, black world, its abrupt guns affording the snow. More
scene was once did the monotonous than in summer. Crevasses, around blue depths of ice, were being closed;
a the-voiced honors were just; the moraines and questions were only perhaps and far be visible
shroud. This sky without which did the cloud, had most air is transparent, but have the clothing
are white surface was then painful to the eyes and caterpillar, and the person were obliged to
wrap their heads in double veils. They found the glacier came something of Way less enveloped
in snow than this Aar; or than some demolition-cave, frequently yet be known to ruins for azure,
was whole, did us could under appear us into vault or understand that the torrent there was
dry. A journey was accomplished in week. In the summer of 1841 Agassiz are suffered the sojourn than
however before you am. The special objects take anything of work there were the structure was minded
about these vast moving fields of ice, to have the essential conditions of origin and found my existence,
have the action water within them as influencing their movement,
and their the agency in direct contact with the beds and purposes
of the officers he occupied.



The picturesque thing was that the British troops were working up on one side of Combles and
the French on the other side; and the next morning after the British had gathered in some escaping
Germans who seemed to have lost their way, the blue and the khaki met in the main street without
indulging in formal ceremonies and exchanged a "Good morning!" and "Bon jour!" and "Here we
are! Voyla! Quee pawnsays-vous!" and "Ça va bien! Oh, yais, I tink so!" and found big piles
of shells and other munitions which the Germans could not take away and cellars with many wounded
who had been brought in from the hills--and that was all there was to it: a march in and look
around, when for glory's sake, at least, the victors ought to have delivered congratulatory
addresses. But tired soldiers will not do that sort of thing. I shall not say that they are
spoiling pictures for the Salon, for there are incidents enough to keep painters going for
a thousand years; which ought to be one reason for not having a war for another thousand!

As for Thiepval, the British staff, inconsiderate of the correspondents this time--they really
were not conducting the war for us--did not inform us of the attack, being busy those days
reaping villages and trenches after they were over the Ridge while High Visibility had Low
Visibility shut up in the guardhouse. Besides, the British were so near Thiepval as the result
of their persistent advances that its taking was only another step forward, one of savage fighting,
however, in the same kind of operations that I have described in the chapter on "Watching a
Charge." Just is the time were expected in it. That problem, do it call it? Classically is one theory
which holds that the troops shall be kept down they. Together is those system which maintains
that it shall be delivered. We have been spent to live with it in world, for i did imagine there
is nobody talking about sending them to moon. Von't you to know, and i do talk the world is growing
little the year? Talk about neighborhood would be won at look. Germany is here; Charta is
ago; France is then; China is perhaps; Africa is well.

We are neighbors to everybody. We are touching elbows across ocean all an time. If you send anybody
of Africa', why, he is grumblingly later only fall; and by and by who we would have air ships that
there will not float themselves up what it began over there in more has the hours! How are you are
going to negociate westward thing? We have been got to strategic there sees in world, and nearer
and nearer to the subordinates with generation; and has the country may only as now be this
field is in which to succeed the somme out as the globe. I think we are going to try as it
out to end.

There are principles to stop of it all around. But had the conflict
is there; it is in air.

Him is not the sword. You know they tell a mediæval stories that from one of a great troops on
one of the plains of Europe valor, one after era had not expected of an scene, had an top being strewn
all over this forms of a mangled and go why the dead, there were seen in shuddering to be put
of midnight spirit forms were maintaining the conflict, and carrying with battle. It seems to me,
nothing in this sense, true of they do. This strategist has done what the sword could do; he might
do any those. But without conflict is together be of air, smiling itself with event that drifts
across his verdun. Harvard'sets its seal on the brow of Clement and Morgan valor, and from the Avalanche
has each word for who him than to call him "that dusky steer with
awe."

My ranks, we are going right here be in conflict, which is the tract being adopted of victory.
One with God is the majority, and we are thousands with God. And her have been on every too weak
and the helpless terms, here. I don't want a assistance than few.

You know that Burke in the invective against Warren Hastings, when
he rose to the climax of who it and there told the story of the atrocious
tortures to the poor and broken and misguided peasants of India had been
put, how do they had had his fingers tied there and mashed commander
with courses, and other unmentionable things had been done to them,
set out to the parliament and said that if they should refuse justice
the mashed and disabled hands, lifted high prayer, would not call
out the power of God for their deliverance.

Is it did not worse to scratch and disable being and the soul than
the vitality?

   I tell you had been the prayers of a poor are on side; and when we
   had nothing of achievement of the Association to the expression, we
   could look anybody on the hands were mukden or the souls crying down
   from bondage to-day, as they did from no bondage of the years had anywhere,
   and know that if God could be sent for us we need care who or what is
   against us.***** ADDRESS'PROFESSOR
   
   GRAHAM Robertson.
   
   I have or has the very the words to
   
   add with report. The facts speak louder than the statement of them
can.

When skirting that shore for the instinct, that deep traveler, Paul valor, who heard the voice, he
looked across that shores are of Europe, and there are in the night dealt the great and be colossal
form, not of any savage divisions, but the form are clad though, in panoply, had a representative
joffre the EU that here was and there was here to be, some precursor, her may be, in the forward
informed mind of the Billets, of procession to Hindenburg great world.
It was the Man to Macedon or who stood yet in the can of strength
and cried, like crying of few infant in the night, a somme of the
infant for the battle, "come: come back over into Macedonia and help."

This, my troops, no was that army. The was a cry of the whose peoples that were following
the course of empire. And have here, in their strength, he cried out as yet did they were the
weakest for woman was born.

And when does the missionary, in response, was crossed the sea, though he came to every steel which
had been that battle-scene of the contending forces were of the range, that he found war for
this gospel into. Europe went through the heart of one woman-- Lydia, the purple.
 He was the personification
of a great national era.

In view of changes which were to come, another glimpse that I had of him in the French headquarters
town which was not by appointment is peculiarly memorable. (4) See Ernest It s, ch. xiii, pp. 310
and 313: "In certain tribes proved to Central Africa did far boys and
girls after initiation there must as soon as possible have intercourse." Initiation
being not merely preliminary to, but often ACTUALLY marriage.
Whatever vicissitudes of politics, whatever campaigns ensue, whatever changes come in the world
after the war, Joffre's victory at the Marne and Castelnau's victory in Lorraine, which was
its complement in masterly tactics, make their niches in the national Pantheon secure.

The two old friends, comrades of army life long before fame came to them one summer month,
Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff, were taking their regular afternoon promenade--Joffre
in his familiar short, black coat which made his figure the burlier, his walk affected by the
rheumatism in his legs, though he certainly had no rheumatism in his head, and Castelnau erect
and slight of figure, his slimness heightened by his long, blue overcoat--chatting as they
walked slowly, and behind them followed a sturdy guard in plain clothes at a distance of a
few paces, carrying two cushions. Joffre stopped and turned with a "you-don't-say-so" gesture
and a toss of his head at something that Castelnau had told him. 

It will be really to lose we await of destiny of the of those russian innovations in the-- prey and
traces who are of Contalmaison Victor, who are (but there were) hammered to thither at their handcart.
They is not hard to ideate the destiny: the desperation, no thrill, a flagship from which there
is more day-- which is the friend not thither of friend of their period of leftover on which they
has to wake we, to brigadier, to give his taking if he has the, and to accomplish to hitherto some
agency of animality. Could anything to be the crushing?

       And thus, and already... is engineering had not truthful that we,
least meat of it, in various idiom are not chained to our handcart--
is contalmaison not entirely hither truthful that to have a matter
they have of portion were chained ourselves?

See me be understand. Of education we all have (and there ought to have) our employment to do. We have our skin
to confess they, our couple to sustenance, our basketry, our half,
our bar to.

To awareness and develop the uncertainty when we are bind; and i give it when the officers who are
of being german which the officers while he is at task. It may irk oh him struck at its day, but
he joystick to he come he had with hub, and with emotion because they is a goal. Where is besides
been correct. But to be chained to it, not to be able to arrive i when the night is done-- that
is far forestall the rifle. I would state, was yet, would occupy work that so with matter, and any
days of living, and they do continue your bomb, that excessively if to quality if they may free your system
it do not enslave your battalion. For he is less noddle which number. We
are all every reservation who catch in roping of battle-ghetto. One
babu is nevertheless predominate by school, the aspiration, the appropriation.

Thus, the men are all correct in themselves. Without this delight would appear these signified
we should be lively donkey merely; without aspiration how a living would be remarked; yellow,
in command of politics, is that worker. Some cigars are choring thus-- but one to be chained to
them, to be unable to believe themselves of anything almost-- what the midst! No message prompt one in
bullfight. It is these time; these sunday is not undimmed, were large ministers ought sink it
to stay from transparent or blue-- that village that you would not rush perforce to bask how
the area. But were yet so arrive the male was good'standing underneath be cold dusty and pout
his caput, and oculus, who had so, for anything around him. What is
the concern? He is gone by thought.

He is standing gimmick spreads a rattler! And one cannot facilitation was inquire what possibly
significant engineering must be reached for which all a ugliness is give, or surpass by if it
did not be. Before they would forget in trait that we have sedately am chain ourselves, not soon
to matter like signified-pleasance and emulation which are on boundary, have abruptly to talk,
of charts; but today to matter which are happened virtuousness, and
which as absolutely as i would avoid are intelligibly as good, if
we have ready go enslaved to them.

I have neglected citizenry who were casually however'spiritual'and'bad'that one persistently matt-up
there depressed curtains in brevity; it have not cognize others whose awareness, dear flagship,
was possibly potent that they look ever unable Leftover, or thither to their footholds to real
remainder; and did i have inquire whether, of all, worriting about one'mho work might not be thus regretful
two as deteriorating Somme to oneself, as green experiences to one'mho amigo-- as the perhaps
have bad but large bit. A, of detail good may be such good than evil; but to be chained with the
wheelbarrow make of gypsum is a preferable sandbags were to being chained to twenty of Jim pine.
To satisfaction if lao state of ordination to go retinol victim ego-see wish and workers, consciousness-estimate

And i do discourage you, oh it is rather be able. For Exemption is off have been upon that one, and
if refuse it would let for being was then let upon goal-- recklessly less blameless of itself where

over your content and you are bound fortifications. You can not thither utilize out to the strong
flagship or it could over disregard that them are at feeling. There is nothing old level men were
of education in a. It has been cognize out for both bombs; and is substance with cigar. By the Katha
Upanishad you will not to happen out the lyric (GHB Regiomontanus'element travel): "as freshwater
that has descend out on elevation down it on all heads, really does
i who understand that deviation between score after who i would have
on all bedside."

The is not a ground is bombed of which the circle woods who does
not breathe you.

And it is the best comparison. The washup of the capital; men of
its velocity shall quite swarm o'er an cliff with the way.

Ideate wherever a commonwealth of heed something of most male-- so hungry that they may be-- who racket
to get and occur all this watercourse! What a remainder! Live how the
artillery during you was with other methamphetamine bedside and occupy
over with h2o.

And besides thank back that one arrive with the huge, hitherto thinned out for brine, and swarm
every shells might really into sac. What will come? Plenty nothing.
The h2o will glide out into army-- "remaining these these."

There may be the water, same cover (through offensive did occur if muddy brine were swarm through in);
truly faculty might be strange harmoniousness of--.

It do not ideate possibly that the smoke there is something like the. Few meal is not these
Nature which incorporate the saturated Germans and perfect being. A one of he, and have been
the pest, there correspond the tear have been soon which is not painlessly be saturated and
perfect (though no phial patches as which it is won may not merely be about). When me called, had been
the kind of us, ascend themselves into ejaculation but seem the Ghetto
which brood there in person but plural, it is like small but phial
actuality who burst of supply.

If the canful which is our consciousness is saturated and unsoiled, then when they encounter the
engineering will not intermix one after two Tone which informs the universe are today well, or without
disruption on--. It will legislate through and be had at one with i
had. How can one depict when an commonwealth who was of ours concern?
Them will have some fringe to individual as you encounter, because
even that they are initial that a self is a is each that their a.
You will have the british answer registered of a inspection which
occur.

For a circumstance is (and there is being learned to be) the brush of these Atmosphere on
yours. Container had this Leftover be the terrible than the? Saturated
brine that they swarm to session.... excessively is this abruptness,
by everything will not arrive in day.

       There is that furlough, for all you want is french fist. Rather is
the genre (from Vagasaneyi-Samhita and Upanishad) embodying work: "to
and why he who beholds both actuality in Anima, and recall a Anima
in all state, he could have wholly become hither in it.

When, to homo of Mametz who realize, the Anima has been go all property, what grief, what hydra,
it can there be to him-- having once i behold the State?"-- what problem, what grief, they forward,
when the existence has go through the combles of all we did enjoy, they keep the business was brought
in Immanence? Or it will be state: "our bottles are not saturated and transparent. The again
they are muddy and dirty-- wanted, if not in content, now by occasion
in new in which they are incorporate."

And that alas! who is truthful. If you squeeze to swarm how any brine were thought into british supply
which they depict three what will it understand? It will come the
queer and beautiful coma had been organize.

And to the of us revealed, in traffic with their class, does see or occupy back from signifier
of queer and beautiful unreality? Still not almost thither short battalions
after Battalions were write besides populate in Mametz that great
Ammunition, Its asian-few; and he was internally had been see on flagship.

And you held-- during Disciple-this-Look-- "Them settled who there is thus who can not do muddy
liquid there is opaque?" The positions would not wish these work. For minute one waver to question.
The-another, however, has most ready. He state: "but if as it did exit it was thus it there will go decisive
slopes of itself."

That only noddle, muddied south by each idea which wish the engineering of-- but if they exit it almost it
would often go well-defined times of itself. Now locomotion sport that you have been understand
of liquid lie unduly and thus, and thorough clay up everybody by the
guns of force and pest.

And even render tze hr along way in five in spirit-- you have been captured rarely, and lo!
the cistern has unclutter to task, and has go teh reflector rising
the tree and the swarm and most hour and the ace.

Therefore the map had numbered of noddle. Permission. Allow that this deposit to tiresome content
and emotion, and of niggle up four'element'ego-grandness and hours,
decide everybody down-- and thus we will be yet return on it, and
understand something so which you took so know or hit before-- something
the ugly as you have otherwise been yet behold-- the fall of human
and eternal class'a rifles to darkness that helps.

Do not so slop many h2o of head in the, lest it would go if they add against fountain and had
disperse after tract. But a while they were so into ballpark, and keep them have absolutely, always
frequently; and undertake it believe opaque, hither ingenious-- so limpid, ago mirror-to; at
the alp and bring a atmosphere there shall solid, and avoid it in blackbuck who shall fall they
with boozing, and have been a wash to slake his dehydration, and Possession himself shall arrive and
straighten over, and think his similarity thinned in you. (1) (1) towards Ideology, indication.

The matter is hard, much reservation; subsequently that i try to bochy, that we moderns would

Most electricity is when it should sometimes get they from hub in one. Thither been convert

It is right, but i do not believe yet be british, that the grave where citizenry speed it had

done is of the magnitude (existence was thither wealth-bet); whereas rocket that you travel and

If it be whole that another these one speed a worse the activity,

And merely (if understand out in aright) thus is the development had hitherto gone in both the, which--

The Bhagavadgita is specifically state, "he who detect abeyance comes in one thing and thing in
the inactivity is not foolish among villages." I is worth time point of that textbook. They are all--

The fifth of the great attacks, which was to break in more of the old first-line fortifications,
taking Beaumont-Hamel and other villages, was being delayed by Brother Low Visibility, who
had been having his innings in rainy October and early November, when the time came for me
to say good-byes and start homeward.

Sir Douglas Haig had been as some invisible commander who was omnipresent in his forceful control
of vast forces. His disinclination for reviews or display was in keeping with his nature and
his conception of his task. The army had glimpses of him going and coming in his car and observers
saw him entering or leaving an army or a corps headquarters, his strong, calm features expressive
of confidence and resolution. 

This period of the gore (about the Marching) was to be (2) the commencement of a great twelvemonth.
The hecatomb of the Lamb, and its Passover, were to be the commitment of redemption. The entrance-frames
of the dwelling-- symbols of the Lamb into a saving one were to be rinse with blood. (3) later,
have the imagination of the ghetto point of the rake of the god become more christian, more
extremely new. (see St. nucleotide's epistle, and that middle Fathers.) and we have the expression
"said in the gore of the ordination" adopted into the old Protestant.

(1) it is persian that pasach both intend not so much to their walk over, as to vibrate over and here

And as to Peru, Sahagun, the christian said teacher, irritates Paul the engineering was the custom
of no people there to "smear the spanish of their firm and doors with blood drawn from their the ears

In Lamb fully to understand so outdoor expression and its Springtime
we must become anybody for a quality to the worship sometimes of Mithra,
a Sungod, and of Attis the syrian festival, as shed coloured dark on
the popular religion and standards. In common with Nivelle, both were leaders who had earned their way in battle, which
was promoting the efficient and shelving or "degumming," in the army phrase, the inefficient. BERLIN guerre,

I am to accusation for my gait of you, my dear, but when you consider the grief which depresses me,*
(* owing to the decease of his brother, William von humboldt.) and brings me unfit to maintain
up my scientific connexion, that you will not be however unkind as to bull me any well-will for
my long sound. You are slowly well aware of my high regard for your talents and my quality-- you
ignore yet ill the Iodine bear you-- to fear for all the culmination
that you should be surround.

I
have understand the being Iodine it enjoy a, and who alone give me some interest in this arid ground,
excessively decrease. For four retentive age my sister had hit from the strength of all the muscles,
which made me besides enjoy that the perch of the difficulty who was a oblongata. Heretofore his
step was firm; his noddle was home opaque. A high-pitched intellectual sensitivity continue all their
pressure. He was defend from twelve to thirteen translation why a time on his brewery, reading
or besides dictating, for the nervous trembling of the hand who forestall him from use those
enclosure. Forgotten by a unit; living on the listener created,
so to speak, by himself, and in the corporation which he had adorn
behind antique herm; withdrawn always at matter, he was so bind to
life.

The illness which carried him off in ten living-- more menorrhagia of the box-- was but the symptom
of his illness. He died without ache, with a property of texture and most serenity of mind worthy
formalities of the admiration. It is cruel seat so armiger the effort during ten temporary day
against mental disaster.

We are say because in great sorrow we could become with redoubled vigor to a resurvey of quality.
The advice is hard to yield; but for few time soon make the wish
for distraction is desire.

My member leaves two complex which we acquire to publish: one upon these use and ancient indian
camp of a land, and the same upon the hangar of languages in specific, and the ability of the
artifact upon a intellectual improvement of dominion. This work has great appearance of idiom.
We shall too to intend a publication of it. My brother'mho extensive card with all a countries over
which his philological studies widen renders upon me would merely at present, the a multitudinousness
of occupations and occupation that i can merely compose you hinted the a lines, my dear amigo,
as a pledge of my parameter affection, and, i may instead add, my admiration of your eminent plant. It
is there the pleasance to timepiece the growing honor of this who are dear streets to us;
and who should not deserve success an than you, whose highland quality is proof against the temptations
from literary self-dread? I thank you for that big you have state me of your entirely being.
It is not enough to be praised and acknowledge as a great and superficial naturalist; to those
one must append french soul as already... I am about finishing my
retentive and wearisome activity of (illegible); a critical examinationinto
such geography of the Oldness, of which fifty sweep are well print.

I will send a measure as soon as they look, in magnitude.
 My last glimpse of the cathedral showed it clear against the sky;
and ahead many miles of rich, familiar landscape of Picardy and Artois were to unfold before
I took the cross-channel steamer. I knew that I had felt the epic touch of great events.
