 Concerning peoples we ignore little none except which we are told by

and are readily, and were greatly criticized to lying.  As reasonable persons we are called upon to be constantly
pronouncing judgment, and either acting upon such judgment ourselves or inviting others to
do so.  I do not know how anything can be more important with respect to any matter than the
forming a right judgment about it.  We pray that we may have "a right judgment in all things."
I am aware that it is an old saying that "people are better than their opinions," and it is
a mercy that it is so, for very many persons not only are full of false opinions upon almost
every subject, but even think that it is of no consequence what opinions they hold. In the spectacular

Although criticism is the act of judging in general, and although I shall not strictly limit
my subject to any particular branch of criticism, yet naturally I shall be led to speak principally
of that branch of which we--probably all of us--think at once when the word is mentioned, viz.,
literary and artistic criticism. On the Eternity so some criticism of contest-- the entrances and
