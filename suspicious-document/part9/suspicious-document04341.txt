It is a gala-night when we rattle down the rough streets, and have pointed out to us the somber
government buildings. The Halifax Club House is a blaze of light, for the Governor-General
is being received there, and workmen are still busy decorating the Provincial Building for
the great ball. The city is indeed pervaded by his lordship, and we regret that we cannot see
it in its normal condition of quiet; the hotels are full, and it is impossible to escape the
festive feeling that is abroad. It ill accords with our desires, as tranquil travelers, to
be plunged into such a vortex of slow dissipation. These people take their pleasures more gravely
than we do, and probably will last the longer for their moderation. Having ascertained that
we can get no more information about Baddeck here than in St. John, we go to bed early, for
we are to depart from this fascinating place at six o'clock.

If any one objects that we are not competent to pass judgment on the city of Halifax by sleeping
there one night, I beg leave to plead the usual custom of travelers,--where would be our books
of travel, if more was expected than a night in a place?--and to state a few facts. Am-from content

 Perhaps you'll hear of him." All this screamed
out into the night.

"Well, I'll take it."

We took the vial aboard and went on; but the incident powerfully affected us. The weird voice
of the old woman was exciting in itself, and we could not escape the image of this unknown
man, dancing about this region without any medicine, fleeing perchance by night and alone,
and finally flitting away down the Gut of Canso. This fugitive mystery almost immediately shaped
itself into the following simple poem:

     "There was an old man of Canso,
     Unable to sit or stan' so.
     When I asked him why he ran so,
     Says he, 'I've St. Vitus' dance so,
     All down the Gut of Canso.'"

This melancholy song is now, I doubt not, sung by the maidens of Antigonish.

In spite of the consolations of poetry, however, the night wore on slowly, and soothing sleep
tried in vain to get a lodgment in the jolting wagon. One can sleep upright, but not when his
head is every moment knocked against the framework of a wagon-cover. Even a jolly young Irishman
of Plaster Cove, whose nature it is to sleep under whatever discouragement, is beaten by these
circumstances. He wishes he had his fiddle along. We never know what men are on casual acquaintance.
This rather stupid-looking fellow is a devotee of music, and knows how to coax the sweetness
out of the unwilling violin. Sometimes he goes miles and miles on winter nights to draw the
seductive bow for the Cape Breton dancers, and there is enthusiasm in his voice, as he relates
exploits of fiddling from sunset till the dawn of day. Other information, however, the young
man has not; and when this is exhausted, he becomes sleepy again, and tries a dozen ways to
twist himself into a posture in which sleep will be possible. He doubles up his legs, he slides
them under the seat, he sits on the wagon bottom; but the wagon swings and jolts and knocks
him about. His patience under this punishment is admirable, and there is something pathetic
in his restraint from profanity.

It is enough to look out upon the magnificent night; the moon is now high, and swinging clear
and distant; the air has grown chilly; the stars cannot be eclipsed by the greater light, but
glow with a chastened fervor. It is on the whole a splendid display for the sake of four sleepy
men, banging along in a coach,--an insignificant little vehicle with two horses. No one is
up at any of the farmhouses to see it; no one appears to take any interest in it, except an
occasional baying dog, or a rooster that has mistaken the time of night. By midnight we come
to Tracadie, an orchard, a farmhouse, and a stable. We are not far from the sea now, and can
see a silver mist in the north. Of the--, i care for an Muriel, who likes up me as her second dad,
and not to whom i am now be bind. If i may fondle the poor rocks, stricken in t, and he allow we

 She blazed and scintillated with a dazzling
brilliance, a throbbing splendor, that made the moon seem a pale, sentimental invention. Steadily
she mounted, in her fresh beauty, with the confidence and vigor of new love, driving her more
domestic rival out of the sky. And this sort of thing, I suppose, goes on frequently. These
splendors burn and this panorama passes night after night down at the end of Nova Scotia, and
all for the stage-driver, dozing along on his box, from Antigonish to the strait. 

Even when you are not pleading with we have in pursuit there vanishes

As we drop down along the shore, there is a white sea-gull asleep on the rock, rolled up in
a ball, with his head under his wing. The rock is dripping with dew, and the bird is as wet
as his hard bed. I pity a child, and could here entertain cordially with her attempt to redeem herself

"Not much."

"Is there any stage for Baddeck?"

"Not to-day."

"Where does this go, and when?"
