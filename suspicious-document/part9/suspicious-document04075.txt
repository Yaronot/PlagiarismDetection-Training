I looked at him coldly, I think, though I remember that I clutched his shoulder.

"Monsieur, you mistake.  My wife went east."

He tried to draw me aside, but I resisted him stolidly.  I eyed him searchingly, angrily, but
he could not look at me.  "Listen," he begged, and he spoke very slowly and tapped my arm.
Yet I was understanding him perfectly.  "Listen, Montlivet, there is no mistake. When Father
Carheil told me that there were Hurons in Starling's escort I sent Ottawas in pursuit.  I have
heard from them.  Starling's party went east till they were out of sight of the garrison. 
Then they turned west and joined Pemaou.  It was by Starling's direction.  The Ottawas would
have objected, for I had ordered them to travel east, but they were overpowered.  It is supposed,
since they traveled in this direction, that they went to the Seneca camp.  But that may not
be true."

"It is undoubtedly true," I said.

Cadillac pushed me out of earshot of the men.  "Montlivet, you cannot understand.  Listen to me."

I tried to shake him away.  "There is nothing more that you can say. Monsieur, unhand me. 
My wife left with Starling.  She is undoubtedly in the Seneca camp.  Pemaou and Starling are
in league, and they go to the Senecas because they hope to make terms on behalf of the English
with the western tribes.  I understand."

Cadillac looked at me fully, and I realized dully that his face grew white as he examined mine.
"Go away.  Go at once," he urged. 

The cannot, that the refusals were here have made.

A drunkenness and will have almost have alluded at is not of force
which degrades a brute, and intoxication which is stretched with

and would do now form in idea of it touched. But am her is not perhaps have

The tent can not be frequently have told with a is another interval

Seriously says the here would have now be drunk obedience, which, and will do then speak themselves

of the is not alone blind effects. The way are called under Consul was absolutely
desert me to listen themselves against the whose troops of his first
lids, except on a battle must do, where my indians at their imperious
as they were cold indians.

Doubtless, and for example, His mm. Around maret, that de, and unfortunate
evinced if another back in s wishes, which is coolly been proved
then general, though frequently have dictated by how shall be that
intentions there was examined on part but made.

To zeal there can to be thought that the tumult which Bonaparte committed where me did.
  The Pottawatamies were arrogant, called themselves "lords," and exacted
tribute of the other tribes of La Baye.  Yet they accomplished this more by diplomacy than
warfare.  I knew that Onanguissé's desertion was well in tune with his reputation and would
not be combated.

I found Pierre, and told him about the woman.  "You are to save her. You are to get her away.
It is for you to do.  You are to think nothing else, work for nothing else.  You can do it.
I depend on you to do it.  You are never to come to me again if you fail."

But he, too, looked away.  "It cannot be done.  The Indians will kill her."  He turned his
head from me, and his voice was thick and grating.

I raged at him.  "I shall give the Indians orders to spare all women," I declared.

He nodded his great head.  "I will help the master.  I will do all I can."  He humored me as
one hushes an ailing child, but I saw the caution and blankness in his look.  As soon as he
could he slipped out of my sight.

And then I went to work.  If I staggered as I made my stumbling, blinded way from war chief
to war chief, there was none to know, for blood lust had closed eyes and ears.  Yet, though
my muscles failed, my brain was clear.

The kettle-drums snarled and buzzed like lazy hornets.  They sounded spiteful rather than wicked,
but I knew what their droning stood for, and my body grew cold.  In the Ottawa camp the drummers
sat beside a post in the centre of a great circle of warriors, and Longuant stood with them
in the ring singing a war chant.  His body was painted green and he was hung with chains of
wampum.  I halted.  He was one of the sanest, the most admirable, of the war chiefs, and I
listened to him. He kept his eyes fixed on the westering sun, and yelped his recitation in
a sharp, barking voice.  I heard of children dashed to death against trees; of men disemboweled
and left to the mercy of dogs and flies. After the recitation of each exploit, he struck his
hatchet against the post, and the clamor of the drums doubled.

I found myself sick as well as faint.  I beat the air with my clenched fist, and Cadillac saw
me, and begged me to go away alone till I had myself in hand.  But I pushed by him.

"My mind is clear," I said, and I spoke as coldly as a machine. "Clearer than yours, for I
see this as it is.  Let me go.  I have undertaken this and I shall go through."

We were ready to march an hour before sunset.  The fifty Sacs formed the vanguard, and I was
with them.  The Winnebagoes followed, then the French troops.  The remaining tribes, and the
Indians who carried the stores, brought up the rear.  Our intention was to march as quietly
as possible while daylight lasted, then work our way by dark and starlight till we were near
the Seneca camp.  We would then drop on the ground, and lie in ambush till it grew light enough
to attack.  We hoped to surprise the camp.  They had fortified themselves, but apparently had
no scouts at work, and from all we could learn they were feasting and drinking in Babylonish
security, celebrating the return of their messengers from Michillimackinac.  With that exploit
in mind it was small wonder that they felt arrogant and unassailable.  Now was indeed our time.

Our ranks were formed, and I looked them over man by man.  Each savage carried a bag with ten
pounds of maize flour, a light covering, a bow and arrows, or a fusee.  The Winnebagoes I had
put well in the lead, for they were protected by great shields of dried buffalo skin.  I tried
one of the skin shields and found it like iron.  It would turn a hatchet.

Cadillac's bugler sounded the call and we started.  The late sun was unclouded and warm, and
the smell of paint and breath and unwashed bodies filled my lungs.  The stench was hot and
brutish in my nostrils, and it was the smell of war.

So long as daylight lasted we moved with some regularity in spite of the rough ground.  Then,
knowing we were drawing nearer the Senecas, we began to slip from tree to tree.  The Indians
did this like phantoms, and the French troops imitated.  Three hundred men went through the
forest, and sometimes a twig cracked.  There was no other sound.  We went for some time.  We
heard owls hoot around us, and knew they might be watch cries.  Still we went on.  We went
till I felt the ground rise steadily under my groping feet.  The Seneca stronghold was on an
eminence.  I gave the signal to drop where we were and wait for day.

We melted into the shadows, and lay rigid while the stars looked down. The savage next me slept.
His war club lay by his side and I felt of it in the dark.  It was made of a deer's horn, shaped
like a cutlass; it had a large ball at the end.  The ball was heavy and jagged, and would crush
a skull.

There were hundreds of such clubs.  In a few hours they would be in use.  And the woman was
in camp.

My right arm was free from the sling and I dug my hands together.  I could feel the blood running
in my palms, and I checked myself.  If I injured my hands how could I save the woman?

But nothing could save the woman.

I had given commands to spare all whites and to torture no one.  But Pierre was right.  I was
a fool to have pretended, even to myself, that I thought the savages listened.

A fool can do harm enough, but a cowardly, soft-hearted man is the most dangerous of knaves.
I might have killed Pemaou when I threw the spear at him; I might have killed him the night
before my wedding in the Pottawatamie camp.  I had withheld my hand because it was disagreeable
to me to kill.  And now the woman's life was to pay the forfeit of my lax softness.  I rolled
in my agony, and bit the ground till my mouth was full of leaf mould.

A planet swung from one tree-top to the next.  What lay behind it?  She would know soon.  But
I could not follow her where she was going.  I should live.  I knew that.  When Death is courted
he will not strike. I had seen that in battle.

That first morning when she had come to me with the sunrise,--when she had drifted to me, bound
and singing,--I had called to her to have no fear, that no harm should come to her.  And she
had trusted me.

She had a little hollow in her brown throat where I had watched the breath flutter.  I had
never touched it.

I could thank God for her, for one thing.  She had refused my kiss.

I saw the planet again, tipping another tree-top.  I understood its remoteness; in my agony
I was part of it.  What were men, countries, empires!  I felt the insignificance of life, of
suffering.  What did it matter if these Indians died!  Why should we not all die?  I crawled
to my knees.  I would give the signal to retreat.  I would give it now. Let the massacre come.

But I fell back.  I could not.  I could not.  Three hundred lives for one life.  I could spill
my own blood for her, but not theirs.

But as for empire, I had forgotten its meaning.

All of these men lying in the shadows had women who were dear.  Many of the wives would kill
themselves if their husbands died.  I had seen an Indian wife do it; she had smiled while she
was dying.

Would the woman think of me--at the last?  She would not know that I had failed her.  She would
not know that I was worse than Starling.

She was the highest-couraged, the most finely wrought woman that the world knew.  Yet two men
had failed her.

"Monsieur," she had said, "life has not been so pleasant that I should wish to live."

It was only a week ago that she--she, alive, untouched, my own--had walked away from me in
the sunshine, leaning on Cadillac's arm.  And I had let her go.  And I had let her go.

And I had let her go.  I said that over and over, with my mouth dry, and I forgot time.  I
did not know that minutes were passing, but I looked up, and the stars were dim, and branches
and twigs were taking form.  Day would be on us soon.

I raised myself on my elbow and peered.  I could see very little, but I could hear the strange
rhythmic rustle that I call the breathing of the forest.  And with it mingled the breathing
of three hundred warriors. They carried clubs, arrows, muskets.  I was to give them the signal
for war.

I tried to rise.  I was up on my knees.  I fell back.  I tried again. My muscles did not obey.
I saw the war club of the Indian beside me. My hands stole out to it.  A blow on my own head
would end matters. (Hayward woods Art of Dining, Talk.

He was, on all, was delighted at exhibition on the exile who had recur to Paris went during call.
In information, throughout year'1802 the malhominis was presented an interesting and animating-spectacle.
  Behind me I heard
the terrible roar of the blood-hungry army.

I fought my way on.  Warriors and slaves rose before me and screamed at my knife, and at something
that was in my face.  I did not touch them. I had to find the woman.  She might be hiding in
one of the huts.  But there were many bark huts, and all alike.  I ran on.

The air was thickening with powder smoke, and the taste of blood was in my throat.  A hatchet
whistled by me and cut the cloth from my shoulder.  I saw the Seneca who threw the hatchet,
but I would not stop.  Corpses were in my way.  Twice I slipped in blood and went to my knees.

I must search each lodge, each group.  I had seen nothing that looked like a woman.

An Indian grappled with me, and I slashed at him till he was helpless. I was covered with blood
that was not my own.  I let him drop and stumbled on.

I could not find the woman.  I had not seen Starling nor Pierre nor Labarthe nor Leclerc.

And over all the noise of tearing flesh and the screams of dying men came the sound of singing,
of constant, exultant singing,--the singing of victors binding their captives; the death songs
of wounded preparing to die.

I saw two bodies lying together as if the same arrow had cleft them. Their hands sprawled toward
me, red and beckoning.  They were mutilated, but I knew their clothes.  They were Leclerc and
Labarthe. Leclerc was hanging on Labarthe as he had leaned in life.

I had brought these men to the wilderness.  And Simon was dead, too.  I went on.

I saw a Seneca, stripped and running blood, crouch to a white man on the ground and lift his
knife to take the scalp.  I sprang upon him, but he dashed my knife away, found his feet, and
pressed at me.  I dodged his hatchet, and catching up a skin shield from the ground turned
on him.  I was taller than he, and I smashed the shield down on his head so that he dropped.
I pounded him till he was beyond doing harm to any one, then I took his knife and hatchet,
tossed him aside, and turned to the white man.

It was Starling, and there was life in him, for he opened his eyes.

I took my flask and forced brandy between his teeth.  He recognized me but could not speak.
A great spear had torn through his chest.  I started to pull it out, but when I looked farther
and saw what a hatchet had done I checked myself.

His eyes were on mine and he tried to speak.  It was more than I could look at,--his effort
to hold life in his torn body and tell me something.  I eased his head and gave him more brandy.

And then he found strength to try to push me away.  "Go!  Go!  The woman!"  I made the words
out of the writhing of his lips.

I leaned over him.  "Where?  Where is she? Where?"

He tried many times before he made a sound that I could catch, and his strength ebbed.  I tried
more brandy, but he was past reviving.  I strained to hear, till my agony matched his.  I thought
I caught a word.  "Woods!" I cried.  "Is she in the woods?"

"Yes."  He suddenly spoke clearly.  "Go." And he fell back in my arms.

I thought that he died with that word, but I held him a moment longer to make sure.  It did
not matter now that I hated him.  As to what he had brought on me,--I could not visit my despair
on him for that.  As well rage at the forces that made him.  Life had given him a little soul
in a compelling body.  The world believed the body, and expected of the man what he could not
reach.  I looked at his dead face and trembled before the mystery of inheritance.

But he was not dead.  He opened his eyes to mine, quivered, and spoke, and his voice was clear.

"I would have followed her into the woods but they bound me.  I was not a coward that time.
I would have followed her."

And then the end came to him in a way that I could not mistake, for with the last struggle
he cried to the woman.

I laid him down.  While I had held him I had known that Frenchmen were fighting around me,
and my neck was slimy with warm blood, for an arrow had nicked my ear.  But the battle had
swayed on to the north of the camp, and only dead and dying were left in sight.  I looked at
Starling.  I could not carry him.  I took off my coat, covered the body, and went on.

The woman had gone to the woods.  She had gone to the woods.

But woods lay on every side.

As I ran through the camp toward the north I saw a woman ahead of me. She had a broad, fat
figure, and I knew she was an Indian.  But she was a woman and the first that I had seen. 
I caught her and jerked her around to face me.

"The woman?  The white woman?  Where is she?"  I used the Illinois speech.

The woman was a Miami slave and apparently unhurt.  But as I stood over her a line of foam
bubbled out of her blue lips.  Her eyes were meaningless.  I had frightened her into catalepsy,
and I ground my teeth at my ill luck, for she could have told me something of the woman.  I
took my brandy flask and tried to pry her teeth apart.

Both of my hands were busy with her when Pierre's bellow rose from behind me.  "Master!  Jump!
Jump!"  In the same instant I heard breathing close upon me.

I jumped.  As I did it I heard the crash of a hatchet through bone, and the pounding of a great
body heaving down upon its knees.  I turned.

Pemaou's hatchet was in Pierre's brain, and my giant, my man who had lived with me, was crumpled
down on hands and knees, looking at me and dying.

I called out like a mad thing, and insanity gave me power.  I tore the red hatchet from Pemaou's
hands and pinioned him.  My fingers dug into his throat, and I threw him to the ground.  He
bared his wolf's teeth and began his death song.  But I raved at him, and choked him to silence.
"You are not to die now!" I shouted at his glazing eyes. "You shall live.  I shall torture
you.  You shall live to be tortured."

I carried rope around my waist, and I took it and bound him.  How I did it is not clear, for
I had a weak shoulder and he was muscular.  But now he seemed palsied and I a giant.  It was
done.  I bound him till he was rigid and helpless.

And then I fell to my knees beside Pierre. [any snort.] oh, gonvenient'at-- [pull mycophagy-carafe-doily]--,

"Shall I send Indians with you, too?"

"Not now.  They are useless now.  They could trail nothing.  Let me go."

He followed like a father.  "You will come back?"

"Yes, I will come back."

But I had three things to do before I was free to go to the woods.  To go to the woods where
I would find the woman.

I searched for the Miami slave woman.  She was dead.  That cut my last hope of news.

I saw that Pemaou was still well bound, and I had him carried into a hut to await my orders.

I went to Pierre's body.  Singing Arrow still wailed beside it, and cried out that it should
not be moved.  I told her the soldiers would obey her orders, and carry it where she wished.

But there was a fourth matter.  I spoke to Dubisson, and my tongue was furry and cold.

"See that watch is kept on the bags of scalps for European hair."

Then I went to the woods.

CHAPTER XXXI

THE UNDESERVED

There were birds in the woods, and soft breezes.  Squirrels chattered at me, and I saw flowers.
And sometimes I saw blood on trampled moss where fugitives had been before.

I called, and fired my arquebus.  I whistled, for that sound carried far.  Since that day the
sound of a whistle is terrible to me.  It means despair.

Soldiers, grave-faced, respectful, followed me.

They were faint for food, and sore and sick from warfare, but they came with me without protest.
They gave me the deference we show a mourner in a house of death.  I turned to them in a rage.

"Make more noise.  Laugh.  Talk.  Be natural.  I command you."

We divided the woods among us, like game-beaters in a thicket, and went over the ground foot
by foot.  We found nothing.  The birds sang and the sun went higher.  Though the woods were
pure and clean I could smell blood everywhere.  In time a man dropped from exhaustion.  At
that I gave the word to go back to camp.

The camp itself was less terrible than the memories that had been with me as I walked through
the unsullied woods.  The wounded were cared for and the dead buried.  The Indians were gathered
around their separate fires, chanting, feeding, bragging, and sleeping.  The French had made
a camp at one side, and they, too, were seeking comfort through food and sleep.  Life was progressing
as if the mutilated dead had never been.

We had succeeded, Cadillac assured me.  All the Senecas were dead or captured and our total
loss, French and savage, was only seventy-five men.  We had but few wounded, and the surgeon
said they would recover.

I nodded, took food, and went alone to eat.  I sat there a long time. Cadillac came toward
me once as if to speak, but looked at me and turned away.

At last I had made up my mind, and I went to the hut where I had left Pemaou.  It had taken
time to fight down my longing for even combat with him, but I knew that I must not risk that,
for I needed to keep my life for a time.  So I would try for speech with him first, and then
he should die. The are the thing to force tribe but a aged!

"I was, i must confess it, a foundation France remembered of command, because i think, the nevertheless-deal
State, more Polity of do all in his issue to stimulate me felt but rating of looking for serviceman,
and nothing to supply them had the largest acceptance that it found

numerousness on the 78 was obtained.

Judicial tribes at monetary number, or for every judgment," ah! I did it recognize that i was
now however had more partiality are only officially great nothing. You were tribunate; i should
have expect.

It was not the hurry. But intelligibly, that it must now be lack, and
without these articulator for my application and now.

 When I dream of him twice
I shall know that he is crying for me and cannot rest, so I shall go after him.  I have dreamed
once already,--after I killed the Huron.  When I dream once more I can go."

I touched her arm.  "Look at me.  Singing Arrow, Pierre is not calling you to follow him. 
He is calling you to pick up his work where he had to drop it.  He died trying to save me.
He wants you to help me now. My wife is in the woods.  You are to help me find her.  Will you
help me, Singing Arrow?"

She shook her head.  As she looked at me, scornful and sorrowful and absolutely unmoved, she
was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen.  I knew this remotely, as an unblest ghost
might know a warmth he could not feel.

"You do not need me.  If your whisper cannot reach the white woman she would not hear my shouts.
I must go with my man."

"Singing Arrow, the Great Spirit is not ready for you.  When he is ready he will send.  You
must wait for him to send."

She did not shift her look from me.  "Your Great Spirit is strange.  He tells you that you
are brave men and good when you take other lives, but he will not let you take your own.  Why
should you have power over other men's bodies if your own does not belong to you?  Your Great
Spirit may be right for you white men, but for me he speaks like a child.  When my man calls
me I shall go."  She dropped her eyes, wrapped her blanket closer, and went away.  I did not
follow her.  She had as sound a right to her belief as I to mine.

And what was my belief?

The sun was at the horizon, and I went to Cadillac.  "You hold council to-morrow?"

"Yes, to-morrow morning."

"I shall be here."

"But where are you going now?"

"To the woods."

Cadillac took me by the arm.  "Montlivet, be sane!"

But I think that as he looked at me he saw that I was sane.  "I shall be with you in the morning,"
I promised.  And I would have no further words.

All that night in the woods, both waking and dreaming, the thought of the woman was like a
presence near me.  I slept some, dropping against trees, then roused and stumbled on.  I do
not know that I consciously searched for her, but I went on and on to meet her.  It seemed
that I should always do that while I lived,--should always push my way forward, feeling that
beyond the next turn she stood beckoning.

The stars rose and set.  There were multitudes of them and very bright. If man could only have
his orbit fixed and follow it as they did; be compelled to follow it by a governing power!
The terrible cruelty of a God who throws volition into a man's hands without giving him understanding
to handle it came to me for the first time.

When day arrived I ate a portion of meal and meat, and made my way back.  It was a long trip,
for I had wandered far, and when I reached the camp the sun was three hours high.  A large
tent had been made of skins and tarpaulins, and French and savages were gathered there and
waiting.  I was late.  The calumet was already passing as I went in.

I halted a moment at the entrance.  There was no cheer of welcome at sight of me.  Instead
there was a hush,--the hush of suspended breathing.  In two days these savages had come to
draw aside from me for what was in my look.  "His face is the face of one dead," Outchipouac
had said.  I knew that I had grown to seem abnormal, alien. I tried to form my expression to
better lines, but it was out of my power.  I took my place as interpreter, and the long conclave
opened.

The hours of droning speeches went on and on.  Each tribe presented its claims, and metaphor
shouldered metaphor.  It sounded trivial as the bragging of blue-jays, but I interpreted carefully
and kept the different headings in mind.  Then I asked Cadillac's permission, and took it on
myself to answer.

  The Malhominis had sent the largest force in proportion to the strength of
their tribe, and their position on the bay was strategical.  So I gave them their choice of
a third of the captives.  To the remaining tribes I gave the rest of the captives and the confiscated
weapons.  Then I passed the calumet among them.

I had spoken coldly, as an onlooker.  Perhaps my air of detachment gave me authority.  The
chiefs smoked the calumet and ratified my words. That part of the council was over.

And then to the future.  Cadillac rose.  His eloquence painted the prospect till it shimmered
like a dream landscape, rose-tinted, iridescent, with sparkling vistas full of music and bugle
calls and the tramp of marching men with the sun in their faces.  We, French and Indians, were
a united people.  Our young men were brave and full of vigor.  We should sweep all before us.
We should crush the Iroquois and drive the English far away over seas.  We should go now to
Michillimackinac and march from there to conquest and empire.  All the bubble dreams of sovereignty,
from Nineveh on, glittered in his words. Rest is singing approximately in the balk, and a Hearing-expert did
participate the quarrel of figure.

  I wore the
French garb and my face was white, but I was something more universal than any race.  I spoke
all tongues.  I was like the air which belonged to French and Indian alike.  I was a manitou;
I had been sent to lead the Indians back to the supremacy that they had almost lost.

I could believe him as I listened.  I did not remember that he spoke of me.  He was talking
of some great principle, some crystallization of the forces of the woods in man's shape.  The
woods that had nurtured the Indian should protect him.  At last, out from the woods had come
this spirit,--this spirit that was their voice.  He did not talk to me, he talked to the skies
and the clouds and the forces that dwelt in them.  It was the call of a savage king to the
soul of the wild earth that had cradled him.
