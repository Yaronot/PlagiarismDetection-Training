The two chiefs, after allowing their followers to breathe for the space of about ten minutes,
again drew up in their files, diminished by nearly one third of their original number. They
now chose their ground nearer to the river than that on which they had formerly encountered,
which was encumbered with the wounded and the slain. Some of the former were observed, from
time to time, to raise themselves to gain a glimpse of the field, and sink back, most of them
to die from the effusion of blood which poured from the terrific gashes inflicted by the claymore.

Harry Smith was easily distinguished by his Lowland habit, as well as his remaining on the
spot where they had first encountered, where he stood leaning on a sword beside a corpse, whose
bonneted head, carried to ten yards' distance from the body by the force of the blow which
had swept it off, exhibited the oak leaf, the appropriate ornament of the bodyguard of Eachin
MacIan. Since he slew this man, Henry had not struck a blow, but had contented himself with
warding off many that were dealt at himself, and some which were aimed at the chief. MacGillie
Chattanach became alarmed, when, having given the signal that his men should again draw together,
he observed that his powerful recruit remained at a distance from the ranks, and showed little
disposition to join them.

"What ails thee, man?" said the chief. "Can so strong a body have a mean and cowardly spirit?
Come, and make in to the combat."

"You as good as called me hireling but now," replied Henry. "If I am such," pointing to the
headless corpse, "I have done enough for my day's wage."

"He that serves me without counting his hours," replied the chief, "I reward him without reckoning
wages."

"Then," said the smith, "I fight as a volunteer, and in the post which best likes me."

"All that is at your own discretion," replied MacGillis Chattanach, who saw the prudence of
humouring an auxiliary of such promise.

"It is enough," said Henry; and, shouldering his heavy weapon, he joined the rest of the combatants
with alacrity, and placed himself opposite to the chief of the Clan Quhele.

It was then, for the first time, that Eachin showed some uncertainty. He had long looked up
to Henry as the best combatant which Perth and its neighbourhood could bring into the lists.
His hatred to him as a rival was mingled with recollection of the ease with which he had once,
though unarmed, foiled his own sudden and desperate attack; and when he beheld him with his
eyes fixed in his direction, the dripping sword in his hand, and obviously meditating an attack
on him individually, his courage fell, and he gave symptoms of wavering, which did not escape
his foster father.

It was lucky for Eachin that Torquil was incapable, from the formation of his own temper, and
that of those with whom he had lived, to conceive the idea of one of his own tribe, much less
of his chief and foster son, being deficient in animal courage. Could he have imagined this,
his grief and rage might have driven him to the fierce extremity of taking Eachin's life, to
save him from staining his honour. But his mind rejected the idea that his dault was a personal
coward, as something which was monstrous and unnatural. That he was under the influence of
enchantment was a solution which superstition had suggested, and he now anxiously, but in a
whisper, demanded of Hector: "Does the spell now darken thy spirit, Eachin?"

"Yes, wretch that I am," answered the unhappy youth; "and yonder stands the fell enchanter!"

"What!" exclaimed Torquil, "and you wear harness of his making? Norman, miserable boy, why
brought you that accursed mail?"

"If my arrow has flown astray, I can but shoot my life after it," answered Norman nan Ord.
"Stand firm, you shall see me break the spell."

"Yes, stand firm," said Torquil. "He may be a fell enchanter; but my own ear has heard, and
my own tongue has told, that Eachin shall leave the battle whole, free, and unwounded; let
us see the Saxon wizard who can gainsay that. He may be a strong man, but the fair forest of
the oak shall fall, stock and bough, ere he lay a finger on my dault. Ring around him, my sons;
bas air son Eachin!"

The sons of Torquil shouted back the words, which signify, "Death for Hector."

Encouraged by their devotion, Eachin renewed his spirit, and called boldly to the minstrels
of his clan, "Seid suas" that is, "Strike up."

The wild pibroch again sounded the onset; but the two parties approached each other more slowly
than at first, as men who knew and respected each other's valour. Henry Wynd, in his impatience
to begin the contest, advanced before the Clan Chattan and signed to Eachin to come on. Norman,
however, sprang forward to cover his foster brother, and there was a general, though momentary,
pause, as if both parties were willing to obtain an omen of the fate of the day from the event
of this duel. The Highlander advanced, with his large sword uplifted, as in act to strike;
but, just as he came within sword's length, he dropt the long and cumbrous weapon, leapt lightly
over the smith's sword, as he fetched a cut at him, drew his dagger, and, being thus within
Henry's guard, struck him with the weapon (his own gift) on the side of the throat, directing
the blow downwards into the chest, and calling aloud, at the same time, "You taught me the stab!"

But Henry Wynd wore his own good hauberk, doubly defended with a lining of tempered steel.
Had he been less surely armed, his combats had been ended for ever. Even as it was, he was
slightly wounded.

"Fool!" he replied, striking Norman a blow with the pommel of his long sword, which made him
stagger backwards, "you were taught the thrust, but not the parry"; and, fetching a blow at
his antagonist, which cleft his skull through the steel cap, he strode over the lifeless body
to engage the young chief, who now stood open before him.

But the sonorous voice of Torquil thundered out, "Far eil air son Eachin!" (Another for Hector!)
and the two brethren who flanked their chief on each side thrust forward upon Henry, and, striking
both at once, compelled him to keep the defensive.

"Forward, race of the tiger cat!" cried MacGillie Chattanach. "Save the brave Saxon; let these
kites feel your talons!"

Already much wounded, the chief dragged himself up to the smith's assistance, and cut down
one of the leichtach, by whom he was assailed. Henry's own good sword rid him of the other.

"Reist air son Eachin!" (Again for Hector!) shouted the faithful foster father.

"Bas air son Eachin!" (Death for Hector!) answered two more of his devoted sons, and opposed
themselves to the fury of the smith and those who had come to his aid; while Eachin, moving
towards the left wing of the battle, sought less formidable adversaries, and again, by some
show of valour, revived the sinking hopes of his followers. The two children of the oak, who
had covered, this movement, shared the fate of their brethren; for the cry of the Clan Chattan
chief had drawn to that part of the field some of his bravest warriors. The sons of Torquil
did not fall unavenged, but left dreadful marks of their swords on the persons of the dead
and living. But the necessity of keeping their most distinguished soldiers around the person
of their chief told to disadvantage on the general event of the combat; and so few were now
the number who remained fighting, that it was easy to see that the Clan Chattan had fifteen
of their number left, though most of them wounded, and that of the Clan Quhele only about ten
remained, of whom there were four of the chief's bodyguard, including Torquil himself.

They fought and struggled on, however, and as their strength decayed, their fury seemed to
increase. Henry Wynd, now wounded in many places, was still bent on breaking through, or exterminating,
the band of bold hearts who continued to fight around the object of his animosity. But still
the father's shout of "Another for Hector!" was cheerfully answered by the fatal countersign,
"Death for Hector!" and though the Clan Quhele were now outnumbered, the combat seemed still
dubious. It was bodily lassitude alone that again compelled them to another pause.

The Clan Chattan were then observed to be twelve in number, but two or three were scarce able
to stand without leaning on their swords. Five were left of the Clan Quhele; Torquil and his
youngest son were of the number, both slightly wounded. Eachin alone had, from the vigilance
used to intercept all blows levelled against his person, escaped without injury. The rage of
both parties had sunk, through exhaustion, into sullen desperation. They walked staggering,
as if in their sleep, through the carcasses of the slain, and gazed on them, as if again to
animate their hatred towards their surviving enemies by viewing the friends they had lost.

The multitude soon after beheld the survivors of the desperate conflict drawing together to
renew the exterminating feud on the banks of the river, as the spot least slippery with blood,
and less encumbered with the bodies of the slain.

"For God's sake--for the sake of the mercy which we daily pray for," said the kind hearted
old King to the Duke of Albany, "let this be ended! Wherefore should these wretched rags and
remnants of humanity be suffered to complete their butchery? Surely they will now be ruled,
and accept of peace on moderate terms?"

"Compose yourself, my liege," said his brother. "These men are the pest of the Lowlands. Both
chiefs are still living; if they go back unharmed, the whole day's work is cast away. Remember
your promise to the council, that you would not cry 'hold.'"

"You compel me to a great crime, Albany, both as a king, who should protect his subjects, and
as a Christian man, who respects the brother of his faith."

"You judge wrong, my lord," said the Duke: "these are not loving subjects, but disobedient
rebels, as my Lord of Crawford can bear witness; and they are still less Christian men, for
the prior of the Dominicans will vouch for me that they are more than half heathen."

 Torquil had just reached the spot where he had resolved to make
the stand, when the young Tormot dropped and expired. His death drew from his father the first
and only sigh which he had breathed throughout the eventful day.

"My son Tormot!" he said, "my youngest and dearest! But if I save Hector, I save all. Now,
my darling dault, I have done for thee all that man may, excepting the last. Let me undo the
clasps of that ill omened armour, and do thou put on that of Tormot; it is light, and will
fit thee well. While you do so, I will rush on these crippled men, and make what play with
them I can. I trust I shall have but little to do, for they are following each other like disabled
steers. At least, darling of my soul, if I am unable to save thee, I can show thee how a man
should die."

While Torquil thus spoke, he unloosed the clasps of the young chief's hauberk, in the simple
belief that he could thus break the meshes which fear and necromancy had twined about his heart.

"My father--my father--my more than parent," said the unhappy Eachin, "stay with me! With you
by my side, I feel I can fight to the last."

"It is impossible," said Torquil. "I will stop them coming up, while you put on the hauberk.
God eternally bless thee, beloved of my soul!"

And then, brandishing his sword, Torquil of the Oak rushed forward with the same fatal war
cry which had so often sounded over that bloody field, "Bas air son Eachin!" The words rung
three times in a voice of thunder; and each time that he cried his war shout he struck down
one of the Clan Chattan as he met them successively straggling towards him.

"Brave battle, hawk--well flown, falcon!" exclaimed the multitude, as they witnessed exertions
which seemed, even at this last hour, to threaten a change of the fortunes of the day. Suddenly
these cries were hushed into silence, and succeeded by a clashing of swords so dreadful, as
if the whole conflict had recommenced in the person of Henry Wynd and Torquil of the Oak. They
cut, foined, hewed, and thrust as if they had drawn their blades for the first time that day;
and their inveteracy was mutual, for Torquil recognised the foul wizard who, as he supposed,
had cast a spell over his child; and Henry saw before him the giant who, during the whole conflict,
had interrupted the purpose for which alone he had joined the combatants--that of engaging
in single combat with Hector. They fought with an equality which, perhaps, would not have existed,
had not Henry, more wounded than his antagonist, been somewhat deprived of his usual agility.

Meanwhile Eachin, finding himself alone, after a disorderly and vain attempt to put on his
foster brother's harness, became animated by an emotion of shame and despair, and hurried forward
to support his foster father in the terrible struggle, ere some other of the Clan Chattan should
come up. When he was within five yards, and sternly determined to take his share in the death
fight, his foster father fell, cleft from the collarbone well nigh to the heart, and murmuring
with his last breath, "Bas air son Eachin!" The unfortunate youth saw the fall of his last
friend, and at the same moment beheld the deadly enemy who had hunted him through the whole
field standing within sword's point of him, and brandishing the huge weapon which had hewed
its way to his life through so many obstacles. Perhaps this was enough to bring his constitutional
timidity to its highest point; or perhaps he recollected at the same moment that he was without
defensive armour, and that a line of enemies, halting indeed and crippled, but eager for revenge
and blood, were closely approaching. It is enough to say, that his heart sickened, his eyes
darkened, his ears tingled, his brain turned giddy, all other considerations were lost in the
apprehension of instant death; and, drawing one ineffectual blow at the smith, he avoided that
which was aimed at him in return by bounding backward; and, ere the former could recover his
weapon, Eachin had plunged into the stream of the Tay. A roar of contumely pursued him as he
swam across the river, although, perhaps, not a dozen of those who joined in it would have
behaved otherwise in the like circumstances. Henry looked after the fugitive in silence and
surprise, but could not speculate on the consequences of his flight, on account of the faintness
which seemed to overpower him as soon as the animation of the contest had subsided. He sat
down on the grassy bank, and endeavoured to stanch such of his wounds as were pouring fastest.

The victors had the general meed of gratulation. The Duke of Albany and others went down to
survey the field; and Henry Wynd was honoured with particular notice.

"If thou wilt follow me, good fellow," said the Black Douglas, "I will change thy leathern
apron for a knight's girdle, and thy burgage tenement for an hundred pound land to maintain
thy rank withal."

"I thank you humbly, my lord," said the smith, dejectedly, "but I have shed blood enough already,
and Heaven has punished me by foiling the only purpose for which I entered the combat."

"How, friend?" said Douglas. "Didst thou not fight for the Clan Chattan, and have they not
gained a glorious conquest?"

"I fought for my own hand," [meaning, I did such a thing for my own pleasure, not for your
profit] said the smith, indifferently; and the expression is still proverbial in Scotland.

The good King Robert now came up on an ambling palfrey, having entered the barriers for the
purpose of causing the wounded to be looked after.

"My lord of Douglas," he said, "you vex the poor man with temporal matters when it seems he
may have short timer to consider those that are spiritual. Has he no friends here who will
bear him where his bodily wounds and the health of his soul may be both cared for?"

"He hath as many friends as there are good men in Perth," said Sir Patrick Charteris, "and
I esteem myself one of the closest."

"A churl will savour of churl's kind," said the haughty Douglas, turning his horse aside; "the
proffer of knighthood from the sword of Douglas had recalled him from death's door, had there
been a drop of gentle blood in his body."

Disregarding the taunt of the mighty earl, the Knight of Kinfauns dismounted to take Henry
in his arms, as he now sunk back from very faintness. But he was prevented by Simon Glover,
who, with other burgesses of consideration, had now entered the barrace.

"Henry, my beloved son Henry!" said the old man. "Oh, what tempted you to this fatal affray?
Dying--speechless?"

"No--not speechless," said Henry. "Catharine--" He could utter no more.

"Catharine is well, I trust, and shall be thine--that is, if--"

"If she be safe, thou wouldst say, old man," said the Douglas, who, though something affronted
at Henry's rejection of his offer, was too magnanimous not to interest himself in what was
passing. "She is safe, if Douglas's banner can protect her--safe, and shall be rich. Douglas
can give wealth to those who value it more than honour."

"For her safety, my lord, let the heartfelt thanks and blessings of a father go with the noble
Douglas. For wealth, we are rich enough. Gold cannot restore my beloved son."

"A marvel!" said the Earl: "a churl refuses nobility, a citizen despises gold!"

"Under your lordship's favour," said Sir Patrick, "I, who am knight and noble, take license
to say, that such a brave man as Henry Wynd may reject honourable titles, such an honest man
as this reverend citizen may dispense with gold."

"You do well, Sir Patrick, to speak for your town, and I take no offence," said the Douglas.
"I force my bounty on no one. But," he added, in a whisper to Albany, "your Grace must withdraw
the King from this bloody sight, for he must know that tonight which will ring over broad Scotland
when tomorrow dawns. This feud is ended. Yet even I grieve that so many brave Scottishmen lie
here slain, whose brands might have decided a pitched field in their country's cause."

With dignity King Robert was withdrawn from the field, the tears running down his aged cheeks
and white beard, as he conjured all around him, nobles and priests, that care should be taken
for the bodies and souls of the few wounded survivors, and honourable burial rendered to the
slain. The priests who were present answered zealously for both services, and redeemed their
pledge faithfully and piously.

Thus ended this celebrated conflict of the North Inch of Perth. Of sixty-four brave men (the
minstrels and standard bearers included) who strode manfully to the fatal field, seven alone
survived, who were conveyed from thence in litters, in a case little different from the dead
and dying around them, and mingled with them in the sad procession which conveyed them from
the scene of their strife. Eachin alone had left it void of wounds and void of honour.

It remains but to say, that not a man of the Clan Quhele survived the bloody combat except
the fugitive chief; and the consequence of the defeat was the dissolution of their confederacy.
The clans of which it consisted are now only matter of conjecture to the antiquary, for, after
this eventful contest, they never assembled under the same banner. The Clan Chattan, on the
other hand, continued to increase and flourish; and the best families of the Northern Highlands
boast their descent from the race of the Cat a Mountain.

CHAPTER XXXV.

While the King rode slowly back to the convent which he then occupied, Albany, with a discomposed
aspect and faltering voice, asked the Earl of Douglas: "Will not your lordship, who saw this
most melancholy scene at Falkland, communicate the tidings to my unhappy brother?"

"Not for broad Scotland," said the Douglas. "I would sooner bare my breast, within flight shot,
as a butt to an hundred Tynedale bowmen. No, by St. Bride of Douglas! I could but say I saw
the ill fated youth dead. How he came by his death, your Grace can perhaps better explain.
Were it not for the rebellion of March and the English war, I would speak my own mind of it."

So saying, and making his obeisance to the King, the Earl rode off to his own lodgings, leaving
Albany to tell his tale as he best could.

"The rebellion and the English war!" said the Duke to himself. "Ay, and thine own interest,
haughty earl, which, imperious as thou art, thou darest not separate from mine. Well, since
the task falls on me, I must and will discharge it."

He followed the King into his apartment. The King looked at him with surprise after he had
assumed his usual seat.

"Thy countenance is ghastly, Robin," said the King. "I would thou wouldst think more deeply
when blood is to be spilled, since its consequences affect thee so powerfully. And yet, Robin,
I love thee the better that thy kind nature will sometimes show itself, even through thy reflecting
policy."

"I would to Heaven, my royal brother," said Albany, with a voice half choked, "that the bloody
field we have seen were the worst we had to see or hear of this day. I should waste little
sorrow on the wild kerne who lie piled on it like carrion. But--" he paused.

"How!" exclaimed the King, in terror. "What new evil? Rothsay? It must be--it is Rothsay! Speak
out! What new folly has been done? What fresh mischance?"

"My lord--my liege, folly and mischance are now ended with my hapless nephew."

"He is dead!--he is dead!" screamed the agonized parent. "Albany, as thy brother, I conjure
thee! But no, I am thy brother no longer. As thy king, dark and subtle man, I charge thee to
tell the worst."

Albany faltered out: "The details are but imperfectly known to me; but the certainty is, that
my unhappy nephew was found dead in his apartment last night from sudden illness--as I have heard."

"Oh, Rothsay!--Oh, my beloved David! Would to God I had died for thee, my son--my son!"

So spoke, in the emphatic words of Scripture, the helpless and bereft father, tearing his grey
beard and hoary hair, while Albany, speechless and conscience struck, did not venture to interrupt
the tempest of his grief. But the agony of the King's sorrow almost instantly changed to fury--a
mood so contrary to the gentleness and timidity of his nature, that the remorse of Albany was
drowned in his fear.

"And this is the end," said the King, "of thy moral saws and religious maxims! But the besotted
father who gave the son into thy hands--who gave the innocent lamb to the butcher--is a king,
and thou shalt know it to thy cost. Shall the murderer stand in presence of his brother--stained
with the blood of that brother's son? No! What ho, without there!--MacLouis!--Brandanes! Treachery!
Murder! Take arms, if you love the Stuart!"

MacLouis, with several of the guards, rushed into the apartment.

"Murder and treason!" exclaimed the miserable King. "Brandanes, your noble Prince--" Here his
grief and agitation interrupted for a moment the fatal information it was his object to convey.
At length he resumed his broken speech: "An axe and a block instantly into the courtyard! Arrest--"
The word choked his utterance.

"Arrest whom, my noble liege?" said MacLouis, who, observing the King influenced by a tide
of passion so different from the gentleness of his ordinary demeanour, almost conjectured that
his brain had been disturbed by the unusual horrors of the combat he had witnessed.

"Whom shall I arrest, my liege?" he replied. "Here is none but your Grace's royal brother of
Albany."

"Most true," said the King, his brief fit of vindictive passion soon dying away. "Most true--none
but Albany--none but my parent's child--none but my brother. O God, enable me to quell the
sinful passion which glows in this bosom. Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis!"

MacLouis cast a look of wonder towards the Duke of Albany, who endeavoured to hide his confusion
under an affectation of deep sympathy, and muttered to the officer: "The great misfortune has
been too much for his understanding."

"What misfortune, please your Grace?" replied MacLouis. "I have heard of none."

"How! not heard of the death of my nephew Rothsay?"

"The Duke of Rothsay dead, my Lord of Albany?" exclaimed the faithful Brandane, with the utmost
horror and astonishment. "When, how, and where?"

"Two days since--the manner as yet unknown--at Falkland."

MacLouis gazed at the Duke for an instant; then, with a kindling eye and determined look, said
to the King, who seemed deeply engaged in his mental devotion: "My liege! a minute or two since
you left a word--one word--unspoken. Let it pass your lips, and your pleasure is law to your
Brandanes!"

"I was praying against temptation, MacLouis," said the heart broken King, "and you bring it
to me. Would you arm a madman with a drawn weapon? But oh, Albany! my friend--my brother--my
bosom counsellor--how--how camest thou by the heart to do this?"

Albany, seeing that the King's mood was softening, replied with more firmness than before:
"My castle has no barrier against the power of death. I have not deserved the foul suspicions
which your Majesty's words imply. I pardon them, from the distraction of a bereaved father.
But I am willing to swear by cross and altar, by my share in salvation, by the souls of our
royal parents--"

"Be silent, Robert!" said the King: "add not perjury to murder. And was this all done to gain
a step nearer to a crown and sceptre? Take them to thee at once, man; and mayst thou feel as
I have done, that they are both of red hot iron! Oh, Rothsay--Rothsay! thou hast at least escaped
being a king!"

"My liege," said MacLouis, "let me remind you that the crown and sceptre of Scotland are, when
your Majesty ceases to bear them, the right of Prince James, who succeeds to his brother's rights."

"True, MacLouis," said the King, eagerly, "and will succeed, poor child, to his brother's perils!
Thanks, MacLouis--thanks. You have reminded me that I have still work upon earth. Get thy Brandanes
under arms with what speed thou canst. Let no man go with us whose truth is not known to thee. You

 This last blow completely broke the heart of
the unhappy King Robert III. Vengeance followed, though with a slow pace, the treachery and
cruelty of his brother. Robert of Albany's own grey hairs went, indeed, in peace to the grave,
and he transferred the regency which he had so foully acquired to his son Murdoch. But, nineteen
years after the death of the old King, James I returned to Scotland, and Duke Murdoch of Albany,
with his sons, was brought to the scaffold, in expiation of his father's guilt and his own.

     BURNS.

We now return to the Fair Maid of Perth, who had been sent from the horrible scene at Falkland
by order of the Douglas, to be placed under the protection of his daughter, the now widowed
Duchess of Rothsay. That lady's temporary residence was a religious house called Campsie, the
ruins of which still occupy a striking situation on the Tay. It arose on the summit of a precipitous
rock, which descends on the princely river, there rendered peculiarly remarkable by the cataract
called Campsie Linn, where its waters rush tumultuously over a range of basaltic rock, which
intercepts the current, like a dike erected by human hands. Delighted with a site so romantic,
the monks of the abbey of Cupar reared a structure there, dedicated to an obscure saint, named
St. Hunnand, and hither they were wont themselves to retire for pleasure or devotion. It had
readily opened its gates to admit the noble lady who was its present inmate, as the country
was under the influence of the powerful Lord Drummond, the ally of the Douglas. There the Earl's
letters were presented to the Duchess by the leader of the escort which conducted Catharine
and the glee maiden to Campsie. Whatever reason she might have to complain of Rothsay, his
horrible and unexpected end greatly shocked the noble lady, and she spent the greater part
of the night in indulging her grief and in devotional exercises.

On the next morning, which was that of the memorable Palm Sunday, she ordered Catharine Glover
and the minstrel into her presence. The spirits of both the young women had been much sunk
and shaken by the dreadful scenes in which they had so lately been engaged; and the outward
appearance of the Duchess Marjory was, like that of her father, more calculated to inspire
awe than confidence. She spoke with kindness, however, though apparently in deep affliction,
and learned from them all which they had to tell concerning the fate of her erring and inconsiderate
husband. She appeared grateful for the efforts which Catharine and the glee maiden had made,
at their own extreme peril, to save Rothsay from his horrible fate. She invited them to join
in her devotions; and at the hour of dinner gave them her hand to kiss, and dismissed them
to their own refection, assuring both, and Catharine in particular, of her efficient protection,
which should include, she said, her father's, and be a wall around them both, so long as she
herself lived.

They retired from the presence of the widowed Princess, and partook of a repast with her duennas
and ladies, all of whom, amid their profound sorrow, showed a character of stateliness which
chilled the light heart of the Frenchwoman, and imposed restraint even on the more serious
character of Catharine Glover. The friends, for so we may now term them, were fain, therefore,
to escape from the society of these persons, all of them born gentlewomen, who thought themselves
but ill assorted with a burgher's daughter and a strolling glee maiden, and saw them with pleasure
go out to walk in the neighbourhood of the convent. Indeed, as every where were all, our duennas whom
are therefore showed: their gait is now english ladies in gentlewomen them; and go the police
may maintain the eye upon them may. Caen is at present were imposed from sure: those even, who,
like steeds, "look," rarely to term shew themselves in lower Normandy; but above unit to have
taken out their town: we have been induced to do so chiefly by glee
of living, and from the advantages who held away with instruction
of their children.
 They observed for some time a deep silence. At length the gay
and bold spirit of the glee maiden rose above the circumstances in which she had been and was
now placed.

"Do the horrors of Falkland, fair May, still weigh down your spirits? Strive to forget them
as I do: we cannot tread life's path lightly, if we shake not from our mantles the raindrops
as they fall."

"These horrors are not to be forgotten," answered Catharine. "Yet my mind is at present anxious
respecting my father's safety; and I cannot but think how many brave men may be at this instant
leaving the world, even within six miles of us, or little farther."

"You mean the combat betwixt sixty champions, of which the Douglas's equerry told us yesterday?
It were a sight for a minstrel to witness. But out upon these womanish eyes of mine--they could
never see swords cross each other without being dazzled. But see--look yonder, May Catharine--look
yonder! That flying messenger certainly brings news of the battle."

"Methinks I should know him who runs so wildly," said Catharine. "But if it be he I think of,
some wild thoughts are urging his speed."

As she spoke, the runner directed his course to the garden. Louise's little dog ran to meet
him, barking furiously, but came back, to cower, creep, and growl behind its mistress; for
even dumb animals can distinguish when men are driven on by the furious energy of irresistible
passion, and dread to cross or encounter them in their career. The fugitive rushed into the
garden at the same reckless pace. His head was bare, his hair dishevelled, his rich acton and
all his other vestments looked as if they had been lately drenched in water. His leathern buskins
were cut and torn, and his feet marked the sod with blood. His countenance was wild, haggard,
and highly excited, or, as the Scottish phrase expresses it, much "raised."

"Conachar!" said Catharine, as he advanced, apparently without seeing what was before him,
as hares are said to do when severely pressed by the greyhounds. But he stopped short when
he heard his own name.

"Conachar," said Catharine, "or rather Eachin MacIan, what means all this? Have the Clan Quhele
sustained a defeat?"

"I have borne such names as this maiden gives me," said the fugitive, after a moment's recollection.
"Yes, I was called Conachar when I was happy, and Eachin when I was powerful. But now I have
no name, and there is no such clan as thou speak'st of; and thou art a foolish maid to speak
of that which is not to one who has no existence."

"Alas! unfortunate--"

"And why unfortunate, I pray you?" exclaimed the youth. "If I am coward and villain, have not
villainy and cowardice command over the elements? Have I not braved the water without its choking
me, and trod the firm earth without its opening to devour me? And shall a mortal oppose my
purpose?"

"He raves, alas!" said Catharine. "Haste to call some help. He will not harm me; but I fear
he will do evil to himself. See how he stares down on the roaring waterfall!" 

Huet stares to prove that the fortress which was built down at caen, was erected by Conachar
William placed the Conqueror, who have frequently i resided here to--
Queen on Matilda, and who was not likely find do that half and given,
as well to hatred his catharine choking of the lords of See, than
to command if the Orne himself.

The sides have of the chapel are lighted down by a hatred-relieved windows, of all columns harm
himself in the angles; and not between these friends are elements, as in chapel by the lazar-half
of s coward St. Julien, at Rouen.

The chapel to presents before other respects, if a surface, unvaried calls, except by four Norman buttresses,
and fear down a string-course to form, running round the glee, to less mid-fame.
 Each bell that tolled rung out, 'Shame on the recreant caitiff!' The brute
beasts in their lowing and bleating, the wild winds in their rustling and howling, the hoarse
waters in their dash and roar, cried, 'Out upon the dastard!' The faithful nine are still pursuing
me; they cry with feeble voice, 'Strike but one blow in our revenge, we all died for you!'"

While the unhappy youth thus raved, a rustling was heard in the bushes.

"There is but one way!" he exclaimed, springing upon the parapet, but with a terrified glance
towards the thicket, through which one or two attendants were stealing, with the purpose of
surprising him. But the instant he saw a human form emerge from the cover of the bushes, he
waved his hands wildly over his head, and shrieking out, "Bas air Eachin!" plunged down the
precipice into the raging cataract beneath.

It is needless to say, that aught save thistledown must have been dashed to pieces in such
a fall. But the river was swelled, and the remains of the unhappy youth were never seen. A
varying tradition has assigned more than one supplement to the history. It is said by one account,
that the young captain of Clan Quhele swam safe to shore, far below the Linns of Campsie; and
that, wandering disconsolately in the deserts of Rannoch, he met with Father Clement, who had
taken up his abode in the wilderness as a hermit, on the principle of the old Culdees. He converted,
it is said, the heart broken and penitent Conachar, who lived with him in his cell, sharing
his devotion and privations, till death removed them in succession.

Another wilder legend supposes that he was snatched from death by the daione shie, or fairy
folk, and that he continues to wander through wood and wild, armed like an ancient Highlander,
but carrying his sword in his left hand. The phantom appears always in deep grief. Sometimes
he seems about to attack the traveller, but, when resisted with courage, always flies. These
legends are founded on two peculiar points in his story--his evincing timidity and his committing
suicide--both of them circumstances almost unexampled in the history of a mountain chief.

When Simon Glover, having seen his friend Henry duly taken care of in his own house in Curfew
Street, arrived that evening at the Place of Campsie, he found his daughter extremely ill of
a fever, in consequence of the scenes to which she had lately been a witness, and particularly
the catastrophe of her late playmate. The affection of the glee maiden rendered her so attentive
and careful a nurse, that the glover said it should not be his fault if she ever touched lute
again, save for her own amusement.
