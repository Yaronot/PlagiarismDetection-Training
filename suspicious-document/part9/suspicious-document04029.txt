If I should here with a compass draw a round, and in looking upon thee, and considering thy
lot, divide the circumference thereof into four-and-twenty equal parts, then form a several
letter of the alphabet upon every one of them; and, lastly, posit a barleycorn or two upon
each of these so disposed letters, I durst promise upon my faith and honesty that, if a young
virgin cock be permitted to range alongst and athwart them, he should only eat the grains which
are set and placed upon these letters, A. C.U.C.K.O.L.D. T.H.O.U. S.H.A.L.T. B.E.  And that
as fatidically as, under the Emperor Valens, most perplexedly desirous to know the name of
him who should be his successor to the empire, the cock vacticinating and alectryomantic ate
up the pickles that were posited on the letters T.H.E.O.D.  Or, for the more certainty, will
you have a trial of your fortune by the art of aruspiciny, by augury, or by extispiciny?  By
turdispiciny, quoth Panurge.  Or yet by the mystery of necromancy?  I will, if you please,
suddenly set up again and revive someone lately deceased, as Apollonius of Tyane did to Achilles,
and the Pythoness in the presence of Saul; which body, so raised up and requickened, will tell
us the sum of all you shall require of him:  no more nor less than, at the invocation of Erictho,
a certain defunct person foretold to Pompey the whole progress and issue of the fatal battle
fought in the Pharsalian fields.  Or, if you be afraid of the dead, as commonly all cuckolds
are, I will make use of the faculty of sciomancy.

Go, get thee gone, quoth Panurge, thou frantic ass, to the devil, and be buggered, filthy Bardachio
that thou art, by some Albanian, for a steeple-crowned hat.  Why the devil didst not thou counsel
me as well to hold an emerald or the stone of a hyaena under my tongue, or to furnish and provide
myself with tongues of whoops, and hearts of green frogs, or to eat of the liver and milt of
some dragon, to the end that by those means I might, at the chanting and chirping of swans
and other fowls, understand the substance of my future lot and destiny, as did of old the Arabians
in the country of Mesopotamia?  Fifteen brace of devils seize upon the body and soul of this
horned renegado, miscreant cuckold, the enchanter, witch, and sorcerer of Antichrist to all
the devils of hell!  Let us return towards our king.  I am sure he will not be well pleased
with us if he once come to get notice that we have been in the kennel of this muffled devil.
I repent my being come hither.  I would willingly dispense with a hundred nobles and fourteen
yeomans, on condition that he who not long since did blow in the bottom of my breeches should
instantly with his squirting spittle inluminate his moustaches.  O Lord God now! how the villain
hath besmoked me with vexation and anger, with charms and witchcraft, and with a terrible coil
and stir of infernal and Tartarian devils!  The devil take him!  Say Amen, and let us go drink.
I shall not have any appetite for my victuals, how good cheer soever I make, these two days
to come,--hardly these four.

Chapter 3.XXVI.

How Panurge consulteth with Friar John of the Funnels.

Panurge was indeed very much troubled in mind and disquieted at the words of Herr Trippa, and
therefore, as he passed by the little village of Huymes, after he had made his address to Friar
John, in pecking at, rubbing, and scratching his own left ear, he said unto him, Keep me a
little jovial and merry, my dear and sweet bully, for I find my brains altogether metagrabolized
and confounded, and my spirits in a most dunsical puzzle at the bitter talk of this devilish,
hellish, damned fool.  Hearken, my dainty cod.
