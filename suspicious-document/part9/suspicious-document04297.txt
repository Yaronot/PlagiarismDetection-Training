SABINE HILLS

  On Sabine hills when melt the snows,
  Still level-full His river flows;
  Each April now His valley fills
  With cyclamen and daffodils;
  And summers wither with the rose.

  Swift-waning moons the cycle close:
  Birth,--toil,--mirth,--death; life onward goes
  Through harvest heat or winter chills
        On Sabine hills.

  Yet One breaks not His long repose,
  Nor hither comes when Zephyr blows;
  In vain the spring's first swallow trills;
  Never again that Presence thrills;
  One charm no circling season knows
        On Sabine hills.

                          GEORGE MEASON WHICHER

EDITORS' PREFACE

The volume on Horace and His Influence by Doctor Showerman is the second to appear in the Series,
known as "Our Debt to Greece and Rome."

Doctor Showerman has told the story of this influence in what seems to us the most effective
manner possible, by revealing the spiritual qualities of Horace and the reasons for their appeal
to many generations of men. These were the crown of the personality and work of the ancient
poet, and admiration of them has through successive ages always been a token of aspiration
and of a striving for better things.

The purpose of the volumes in this Series will be to show the influence of virtually all of
the great forces of the Greek and Roman civilizations upon subsequent life and thought and
the extent to which these are interwoven into the fabric of our own life of to-day. Thereby
we shall all know more clearly the nature of our inheritance from the past and shall comprehend
more steadily the currents of our own life, their direction and their value. This is, we take
it, of considerable importance for life as a whole, whether for correct thinking or for true
idealism.

The supremacy of Horace within the limits that he set for himself is no fortuity, and the miracle
of his achievement will always remain an inspiration for some. But it is not as a distant ideal
for a few, but as a living and vital force for all, that we should approach him; and to assist
in this is the aim of our little volume.

The significance of Horace to the twentieth century will gain in clarity from an understanding
of his meaning to other days. We shall discover that the eternal verity of his message, whether
in ethics or in art, comes to us with a very particular challenge, warning and cry.

INTRODUCTION: THE DYNAMISM OF THE FEW

To those who stand in the midst of times and attempt to grasp their meaning, civilization often
seems hopelessly complicated. The myriad and mysterious interthreading of motive and action,
of cause and effect, presents to the near vision no semblance of a pattern, and the whole web
is so confused and meaningless that the mind grows to doubt the presence of design, and becomes
skeptical of the necessity, or even the importance, of any single strand.

Yet civilization is on the whole a simple and easily understood phenomenon. This is true most
apparently of that part of the human family of which Europe and the Americas form the principal
portion, and whose influences have made themselves felt also in remote continents. If to us
it is less apparently true of the world outside our western civilization, the reason lies in
the fact that we are not in possession of equal facilities for the exercise of judgment.

We are all members one of another, and the body which we form is a consistent and more or less
unchanging whole. There are certain elemental facts which underlie human society wherever it
has advanced to a stage deserving the name of civilization. There is the intellectual impulse,
with the restraining influence of reason upon the relations of men. There is the active desire
to be in right relation with the unknown, which we call religion. There is the attempt at the
beautification of life, which we call art. There is the institution of property. There is the
institution of marriage. There is the demand for the purity of woman. There is the insistence
upon certain decencies and certain conformities which constitute what is known as morality.
There is the exchange of material conveniences called commerce, with its necessary adjunct,
the sanctity of obligation. In a word, there are the universal and eternal verities.

Farther, if what we may call the constitution of civilization is thus definite, its physical
limits are even more clearly defined. Civilization is a matter of centers. The world is not
large, and its government rests upon the shoulders of the few. The metropolis is the index
of capacity for good and ill in a national civilization. Its culture is representative of the
common life of town and country.

It follows that the history of civilization is a history of the famous gathering-places of
men. The story of human progress in the West is the story of Memphis, Thebes, Babylon, Nineveh,
Cnossus, Athens, Alexandria, Rome, and of medieval, Renaissance, and modern capitals. History
is a stream, in the remoter antiquity of Egypt and Mesopotamia confined within narrow and comparatively
definite banks, gathering in volume and swiftness as it flows through Hellenic lands, and at
last expanding into the broad and deep basin of Rome, whence its current, dividing, leads away
in various channels to other ample basins, perhaps in the course of time to reunite at some
great meeting of waters in the New World. To one afloat in the swirl of contradictory eddies,
it may be difficult to judge of the whence and whither of the troubled current, but the ascent
of the stream and the exploration of the sources of literature and the arts, of morals, politics,
and religion, of commerce and mechanics, is on the whole no difficult adventure.

Finally, civilization is not only a matter of local habitation, but a matter of individual
men. The great city is both determined by, and determines, its environment; the great man is
the product, and in turn the producer, of the culture of his nation. The human race is gregarious
and sequacious, rather than individual and adventurous. Progress depends upon the initiative
of spirited and gifted men, rather than upon the tardy movement of the mass, upon idea rather
than force, upon spirit rather than matter.

I preface my essay with these reflections because there may be readers at first thought skeptical
of even modest statements regarding Horace as a force in the history of our culture and a contributor
to our life today. It is only when the continuity of history and the essential simplicity and
constancy of civilization are understood that the direct and vital connection between past
and present is seen, and the mind is no longer startled and incredulous when the historian
records that the Acropolis has had more to do with the career of architecture than any other
group of buildings in the world, or that the most potent influence in the history of prose
is the Latin of Cicero, or that poetic expression is more choice and many men appreciably saner
and happier because of a Roman poet dead now one thousand nine hundred and thirty years.
