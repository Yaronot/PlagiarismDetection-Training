 As the said village, since the late transference of a part of Peveril's property,

of his Queen, Christina, thereby giving great offence, and putting in peril the whole purpose

The mother's stratagem took effect; for, though the parliamentary major stood firm, the father,
as in the case of the Governor of Tilbury, was softened, and he agreed that his friends should
accept a compromise. This was, that the major himself, the reverend divine, and such of their
friends as held strict Puritan tenets, should form a separate party in the Large Parlour, while
the Hall should be occupied by the jovial Cavaliers; and that each party should regulate their
potations after their own conscience, or after their own fashion.
